He was a soldier fighting for the moderate faction of Ctrigall, a country that is in a state of civil war with extremists who wants to return to the war. Unsure of what to do with his money, he decided to use the service of Auto Memories Doll and entrusted Violet to write letters for his parents and his lover Maria before his death. Appearance. Aidan was a young man with a slender and muscular build with freckles located on the bridge of his nose. He had wavy dark blond hair and light brown eyes. He was also noted to be rather handsome. Personality. Aidan had always been kind, confident and considerate since his childhood. However, as he grew older and got exposed to the true nature of civil war, Aidan became very scared of dying, he favored exterminating others rather than being exterminated. He only lived with the thought of surviving and returning back to his family and childhood friend as well as lover Maria. Although horrified by it, Aidan was able to accept the fact that all his comrades were being annihilated in the war, which made him traumatized and scarred with everything that happened around him. He didn't want to hurt or kill anyone, not being able to understand the reason why people had to fight and kill each other. As a human being, Aidan felt completely lost about who decided that things should end the way it did. He wished to have never taken part in the war and dreamed of returning back home since he wanted to meet everyone in his hometown again. It is also seen that Aidan was a very helpful young man with a strong sense of justice, as he would rather see Yale, someone younger than him, survives rather than himself. He would always put people before himself and cherished his comrades deeply. He also wanted everyone, including himself, to live a happy life, free from the conflicts of the war. His parents and his girlfriend Maria meant everything to him, and he is sorrowful to have left them behind before thanking and apologizing to them properly, which he regretted more than anything. However, he was able to rest peacefully as Violet gave him the warmth he required in his last moments and since she promised that she would convey his feelings to his loved ones. History. Aidan grew up with his parents in the countryside. As a child, he also became good friends with a girl named Maria and a boy name Yale who grew up in the same province as him. Ever since childhood, Aidan proclaimed to his parents that he would become a baseball player. He was talented at the sport enough to bear ambitions towards it, and, after graduating, he had already decided to join a prestigious baseball team. Although he was a small town boy, he thought that he could become a professional player. To him, such a future had been already certain. However, as Aidan grew up, instead of becoming a baseball star, he became a fighting soldier for a moderate faction of Ctrigall, a country that is in a state of civil war with extremists who wants to return to the war. The government decided on its own that they were obligated to come there, so Aidan didn't have a say in this. Around that time, Maria confessed her love to Aidan and he reciprocated her feelings, so they become an official couple. However, as Aidan claimed, before having done anything with her that couples usually do, he was sent away to Ctrigall to fight as a soldier in the 34th National Army. Story. The CH Postal Company receives a request for a doll from the neighboring country of Ctrigall, however, the country is in a state of civil war between the warmongers and moderates. The request is from Aidan, who is a soldier fighting on the front lines, but due to the danger, Hodgins refuses the request. Violet overhears and travels to Ctrigall to find Aidan. Aidan fought for the moderate faction within the dense forest of a continent far away from his motherland. The enemy nation that his country fought against kept an oilfield drilling facility in secret. The mission of the 34th National Army, which Aiden belonged to, was to charge into the said facility and take complete control of it. The squad constituted of a hundred people in total and their strategy was to split into four groups and strike from all sides. After a sudden first attack from the enemies, the simultaneous raid from all four sides was destroyed along with the formation of the groups by a sudden rain of bullets. In the process, Aidan's squad was annihilated by the enemy and he is gravely wounded. His friend and comrade Yale survived and Aidan attempted to help him before he got shot as well. Terrified, Aidan left his annihilated squad behind and he was tracked down by the enemies. Before they were able to finish him off, Violet arrived by parachute, defeated the enemy soldiers, and rescued Aidan. Briefly thereafter, the two arrived at an abandoned cottage with the intention of using it as a temporary hideout. Believing that he is mortally wounded, Aidan has Violet write farewell letters to his parents and girlfriend Maria. With the letters complete, Violet comforts Aidan in his final moments as he pictures himself reuniting with Maria. Violet delivers the letters to Aidan's parents and Maria. Despite being saddened by Aidan's death, they thank Violet for delivering his final letters to them. Violet then breaks down in tears, apologizing for being unable to protect Aidan.

{"url":"https:\/\/violet-evergarden.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=160","text":"Benedict Blue is a character in the \"Violet Evergarden\" series. He is a postman working at the CH Postal Company. He has known Hodgins since before the company's establishment and has had a brusque attitude towards him ever since he started to work there. Appearance. Benedict is a slim young man with bright sky-blue eyes and light skin. He has short and spiked sandy-blond hair with a short hairline. A part of his forelocks hangs lengthier on one side, framing the left side of his face. Benedict is noted to dress rather flashily; he wears a loose spring-green shirt (beige in the anime) with pale-golden suspenders and a pair of military-green tight leather pants. He also wears a black\/grey undershirt. His long, black boots have tall cross-shaped heels. He also wears a pair of black fingerless gloves. Personality. Benedict is shown as a slightly short-tempered, uncouth, and stubborn young man, to which his attitude and speech come off as blunt and rude. He isn't very good with words or being respectful, especially when it comes to Hodgins. He has a tendency to face people head-on and has no problem telling people what to do. He also has no problems voicing his own thoughts, but since he is insensitive and oblivious to his surroundings, his words can sometimes offend people and come off as a little too straightforward. Despite that, he is kind and gentle at heart, and is considerate of those he cares about. He can even be considered a bit chivalrous, as he stated that he would not let a woman like Violet do a job alone despite her having great strength. However, Benedict said this since he knew that he would be scolded by Hodgins if he made Violet do something exhausting. He can be seen as slightly flirty and charming, as he invited the receptionists Nerine and Lilian to eat the lunch that he had bought for them with him. But when they declined, Benedict was seen to be very upset by the fact that they had turned him down without even appreciating what he had done for them. This is why he thinks women are very calculating these days. However, he is a diligent hard-worker, as the occupation of a postman requires great patience and hard work. Benedict is generally an easy-going person who is responsible and knows what to do, to which he is good at giving instructions and has strong leadership skills. However, and he can come off as unclear sometimes. Like Violet, he always strives for the right answer and is not above correcting people when something is considered wrong. He is a strong fighter and has somewhat of a rivalry with Cattleya as they constantly argue. He is also shown to be somewhat innocent, as he began to blush furiously when Violet obliviously attempted to change clothes in front of him, and when he overlooked Hodgins and Cattleya share an intimate moment. Relationships. Claudia Hodgins. Benedict has been friends with Hodgins for a long time, and he was one of the CH Postal Company's initial employees. Despite Hodgins being his boss, Benedict displays a brusque attitude towards him. Benedict is not very formal with Hodgins, will act nonchalantly towards him and sometimes even try to annoy him on purpose, much to the latter's annoyance. Hodgins also tends to grow irritated whenever Benedict openly voices his thoughts which can be offending. Since Benedict isn't very good at the manners of a gentleman, Hodgins is the one who teaches him about these matters since he is good at it. Hodgins will also criticize Benedict for his possible mistakes with women. Benedict sometimes impersonates with so much emotion that it is most likely an imitation of Hodgins. However, they do share a close relationship as old friends. Cattleya Baudelaire. Cattleya is a fellow co-worker of Benedict's. They are always at odds with each other and argue constantly, tending to be bitter and sullen in one another's presence. Benedict describes Cattleya as a stupid woman and wishes that she could learn some manners; Cattleya, in turn, is greatly annoyed by Benedict and says that she has a hard time holding back to not hit him, with Benedict claiming that she actually has hit him. Their rivalry and arguments are something normal at the CH Postal Company, as people are used to the two biting each other in the course of conversations whenever they opened their mouths. The dislike they harbor for each other and the reason behind their constant arguments are yet to be revealed. However, Cattleya is seen to ask Benedict, \"How long are you going to keep this up?\" to which Benedict claims that Cattleya is the one with the problem. Despite their heated relationship, they can act maturely with each other and will help one another when needed. Cattleya was even seen to treat a wound on his ankle once. However, Benedict still continues to call Cattleya a \"stupid woman.\" Violet Evergarden. Violet is a friend to Benedict. Although he initially acted uncaring towards her, he eventually warmed up as he was tasked to help Violet when she given the work as a postman. He is friendly and caring towards Violet and tries to give her advice when she is feeling down. Upon Hodgins' request, Benedict is tasked to look after Violet and make sure that she doesn't get hurt when on jobs they do together. Benedict also enjoys meddling in her business and calls her \"Vi.\" There is a possibility that Violet is Benedict's long lost younger sister. Both have no memories of their past and have a tangled history with the Great War. Benedict opened up to Violet about his amnesia and told her that the only thing he remembers is that he has a little sister. He didn't know what she looked like, but he was sure that he'd recognize her when he sees her again. Gallery. &lt;tabber&gt; Anime= Light Novel= &lt;\/tabber&gt;"}

It is also included in the story collection \"Violet Evergarden ~Last Letter~\". Summary. The story follows the development of Violet and Benedict's relationship from Benedict's point of view. At first, Violet would often get turned away by clients because they were repulsed by her prosthetic arms. Benedict, while feeling unnerved by her odd nature, couldn't help but feel worried about her. He spots her out in town one day, clearly lost but unwilling to ask for help. He calls out to her and gives her a ride back to the postal company. Violet tries to pay him back, but he refuses, so she asks if she could count on him to give her rides for her work. He agrees. Another time, Benedict, while in a caf\u00e9, sees Violet walking outside in the rain. He silently invites her to take a break, but she declines. He waves her goodbye, and she waves back, which surprises him. He remarks on how neither of them would have waved at each other in the beginning. Some time later, Violet brings Taylor to Hodgins and Benedict and asks them to help find Isabella York. Benedict can't say no to her and agrees. One day, Violet visits Benedict's apartment for the first time, reminding him that they promised to find a gift for Hodgins to give him on the anniversary of CH Postal Company's founding. The two of them had gone drinking the day before, and Benedict had drunkenly talked about his gratitude towards Hodgins for taking him in. Violet ended up bringing him back home. As time went on, the two grew closer and closer, to the point of even attending a wedding between two coworkers together. Looking at the two of them in a mirror, Benedict remarks that they truly did look like siblings. Benedict thinks about how Violet changed him and how precious she is to him. He makes Violet promise to tell him when she gets married. Violet agrees. "}

Her embroidered thread garter belt consists of geometrical patterns and decorates only the bare skin from the middle of her tights to her knee-high boots. Personality. Cattleya is a woman with intense and passionate emotions. Although she possesses great strength, she is very feminine, can be quite sensitive, and is constantly worrying about her appeal towards Hodgins. She is a very talented Doll who is experienced in love, which is why she is usually put in charge of lovesick clients. She treasures the concept of love, be it romantic, fraternal, platonic, sibling, or companion. She believes that love is necessary for living as it is like a symbol of happiness. However, she states that she doesn't fully understand romantic love and thinks love is uncertain, but can tell when it happens. Cattleya is shown to be a very warm, kind, and welcoming person, which is shown when she instantly warmed up to Violet and helped her with her work as a Doll. She is someone who has a realistic view on life, as she knows that words have different meanings depending on who hears them and that words don't simply tell people everything.

However, she is not afraid to voice her opinions or properly scold people when they make a mistake. She is also very physically strong, which gives her the habit of trying to solve everything with force because she has confidence in her physical strength. Despite being a beautiful adult with a mature appeal, Cattleya can actually display a very childish and na\u00efve side of her personality, especially around Hodgins. She is noted to act like a child when things don't go the way she wants, and comes off as honest and blunt. She also likes being praised whenever she does something good.

Cattleya claims that she has an older-sister kind of vibe to her and feels comfortable taking on that role. History.

Despite Charlotte is anxious about the wedding, Violet writes the love letter, and Damian writes a letter back in response, but Charlotte does not appear satisfied with it. Charlotte later confides in Violet that she met and grew infatuated with Damian when she first met him, since he treated her as a person and not a potential wife. However, she's unsure of whether Damian reciprocates her feelings or not, since she could tell the letter he returned contained no emotion in it.

She is the mother of Ann, who had a terminal illness and predicted that her fate was close. Worrying that her daughter would be all alone after her death, she requested Violet to write down fifty letters for Ann that each will be sent on her birthday for the next fifty years. Appearance. Clara was a woman with light brown eyes, fair skin, freckles, and a slender body. She wore her wavy dark brown hair in a low ponytail with a blue ribbon and bangs framing her face. She was noted to have an old-fashioned taste, and even after aging, something about her still resembled something of a \"young lady\". Personality. Ann noted that her mother was like a little girl. She was vigorous in spite of being a clumsy person, and she would be enthusiastic in every situation. She was fond of boat rides and dog races, as well as oriental flower arrangements that could be found in quilt embroidery. She was a person who loved learning, had a hobbyist side to her, and liked watching romance plays. She was keen on laces and ribbons, her dresses and one-pieces mostly similar to those of princesses from fairytales. She imposed them on her daughter, as she fancied parent-children matching outfits. Clara was also noted to value the beautiful, as Ann claims that the main reason why Violet had been chosen to write the letters was that she was beautiful. Clara was a very kind, friendly and happy person despite her frail body and short lifespan. She was also very carefree, easy-going and fast to confide in anyone. Raised as a daughter from a wealthy household, Clara was taught to be graceful and polite, traits she teaches to her daughter. She is not above scolding her daughter for something she is not supposed to do. But she has strong parental instincts and loves Ann more than anything in the world, and is deeply saddened by the fact that she has to leave Ann all alone after her death. History. Clara comes from a wealthy household, she was raised as an elite woman and was a qualified bachelor with a high education level. At some point in her life, she married a man and had one daughter, Ann, with him. Clara's husband never stayed home and didn't work much, prospering in taking over the family\u2019s main business. Not once had he visited her when she had become terminally ill, and just when they had thought that he was going to come back after some time had passed, he had actually only stopped by to take vases and paintings from the house and sell them. It seemed he had been a family heir with a promising future in the past. But a few years after getting married, his side of the family had faced minor commercial issues and crumbled, and the finances had become dependent on the Magnolias. It appeared that the reason behind said minor commercial issues had been her husband himself. Back when Clara was healthy, she used to often throw salon parties and invite many friends over to the manor. However, she lost contact and involvement with those people over the years. Because of that, Clara and Ann lived alone on the top left side of an old but stylish western-architecture building in Lechernt, that Clara had inherited from her family. The residence was peripheral, having been built secluded and quite far from their prospering town. Clara was physically weak, so she had a maid named Eris take care of her, in which she was regularly seen being bedridden. Story. Clara hired Violet for seven days to write letters, but Ann is not told what the letters are about or who they are for. Clara explained to Ann that she couldn't reveal who the letters were for and that she had to work on them, to which Ann was very jealous during this period for not being able to spend much time with her mother. However, although Clara had become a little healthier a couple of days after Violet\u2019s arrival, her physical condition gradually worsened. Even in such conditions, Clara insisted that her work had to be done, and she and Violet did not halt their work. Clara laid on her bed while Violet resumed typing the letters, sitting next to it. This is what made Ann so upset, the fact that Clara pushed herself so much to write the letters. Although Clara was clearly saddened by Ann\u2019s feelings, she insisted that she had to be done with her work, stating that if she didn't write them then, she might never be able to. After an angry outburst by Ann, Violet managed to calm Ann down and convince her not to blame herself for her mother's illness, and that there was a good reason behind why her mother was so intent on writing the letters. After the letters were written, Violet took her leave. Clara spent the last days of her life in peace with her daughter, showering and pampering her with happiness. And on a spring day, Clara peacefully passed away. Afterward, Ann began receiving the letters from her mother written by Violet, which is revealed to be letters that would be delivered to Ann on her birthdays for the next fifty years. What Clara had so deeply wished for was for Ann to be happy in without her, and to know she would always be watching over her."}

Majority of the time, it is in the subarctic zone, which makes the entirety of it cold. However, during summer, the temperatures rise to the extent that agricultural production is possible, so there are people living in it as well. Furthermore, since the various countries of the Northern Alliance are blessed with underground resources, the living standards of the residents are kept relatively high by exporting them to neighboring countries. However, this gave place to discord amongst many surrounding nations, and there was no small amount of countries that do not think well of Ctrigall from behind the scenes. Overview. During the Continental War, Ctrigall continuously made profits as exporters of resources, so several domestic factions wished for the warfare to go on. As the war ended and abundant and inexpensive resources started being imported from the South, the profits of the other countries drastically declined, therefore, the pro-war-continuation factions remained active and set up a civil war against the government, which had accepted peace. In opposition to this, neighboring countries dispatched troops together while claiming it to be for the sake of public order, and soldiers from the Republic of Sorbas stationed troops at the Menace Camp, located along a border at the southeast end of Ctrigall. There was a base belonging to the war advocacy faction in the proximities of the Menace Camp, and, as the current main purpose was the mission of surveilling it, the camp did not house not many units."}

{"url":"https:\/\/violet-evergarden.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=600","text":"Dietfried Bougainvillea is a character in the \"Violet Evergarden\" series. He is a naval captain in the navy and Gilbert's older brother. He was the one who found Violet and made her into Gilbert's \"weapon\" on his promotion to a major in the army. Appearance. Dietfried is a man with a tall stature, thin waist and broad shoulders, which is common for Bougainvillea men. Like his brother, Dietfried has jet-black hair, emerald eyes, and lines under his eyes. Additionally, a small mole sits under his left eye. Unlike his brother, Dietfried's eyes have a lighter shade of green, and he wears his long hair in a braid tied with a blue ribbon. He wears a standup collar on his white naval uniform which is wide open, displaying the gold necklace around his neck. Personality. Dietfried is stated to have a flirtatious air about him. Although he has a self-centered and bossy personality, he is social and charismatic, having some sort of quality that draws others to him. He is confident, never claiming to be afraid of anything and always being surrounded and respected by many people, never bashful of it. Since Gilbert could not love anyone due to being too stern, his elder brother had everything he lacked, to the point of making him infinitely envious as a fellow person. Dietfried is also easy-going, preferring to be playful and talk about fun matters rather than being confrontational. But he can also be very frank, and although he tries to come off as lighthearted, his words can be rude at times. Despite that, he can be compassionate; he loves his family deeply and values his underling's lives. He is also hardworking and influential, being the first Bougainvillea to join the navy. Not only had he joined it, but also steadily carved a career path for himself in it. It was all due to his confidence in scoring achievements with his own efforts and talents, even without making use of his parents\u2019 glory. He appears to have good leadership skills and responsibility, in which he can handle everything quite nicely. Although he possesses a sense of right and wrong and, he can also be cruel and merciless which is demonstrated by his actions towards Violet. He was aggressive towards her and saw her nothing more than a weapon, which is the reason he took her home. He had no problem with ordering Violet to murder people like a weapon and appeared to find enjoyment within this, though this stems from his hatred towards Violet for killing his men. Towards the end of the series however, Dietfried appears much calmer and less cold towards Violet. Dietfried knows he has been doing horrible things, much worse than Violet had done for a living. He cares very little, knowing that it will all be over when he dies, either way, showing a certain amount of nihilism. He has had his own laments and hardships, and there were also times when he thought dying would be much better. At those moments, he even considered doing so. He feels guilty for allowing his companions to die, blaming himself for not being able to protect them. He also continues to visit the families of his companions that Violet had killed to give them money, displaying his remorse. He thinks that rather than dying, it\u2019s harder to stay alive. Despite that, he is confident that he will live on, and expects Violet to do the same despite her mistakes. History. Dietfried was born into an upper-class family worshiped as national heroes, the Bougainvillea family. Since a young age, Dietfried and his younger brother Gilbert were trained by their father since they would become soldiers once when they grew up. This is due to the fact that it was customary for the Bougainvillea men to enlist in the army. After the brother's father's death, Dietfried, as the eldest son, was expected to become the head of the family. However, he felt like that role suited Gilbert better and left him to take over the inheritances on his own. Dietfried states that the Bougainvillea household was never adequate for him and that he was not cut out to be the family head. In the history of the Bougainvillea family, Dietfried had been the first to choose the navy over the army. He made a name for himself and eventually got promoted to a naval captain. Four years prior to the story, Dietfried met Violet when he and his underlings were completely butchered by an armed fleet that was plotting to destroy one of Leidenschaftlich\u2019s maritime trading ports. On a certain night, in the middle of the battle, they were hit by a huge storm. It was a grave catastrophe where both the allies and enemies sank into the coastal seas. The ship stranded, and Dietfried and some of his comrades arrived at a deserted island where they saw Violet. Dietfried was unsure if she had become orphaned or if she had suffered an accident in the sea just like them. Although Dietfried didn't have any intention of doing anything since he was already annoyed, his subordinates approached Violet and attempted to molest her. Before Dietfried was able to stop them, Violet killed them. Terrified by her actions, the remaining soldiers all fled, but Violet continued hunting after them. Dietfried and his remaining underlings then decided to kill her, but before they could act, she had already slaughtered everyone except for him. After that, he was pursued by Violet, but she only followed him around and didn\u2019t attempt to murder him. Dietfried realized that Violet couldn't talk and couldn't understand words. He also concluded that she was the only inhabitant of that island and that the reason she had killed so many people was simply that she was ordered to do it. Once he understood that, Dietfried did repeated experiments; for example, if he pointed to animals or insects and said \"kill,\" she would immediately do so. This also applied to humans. Despite her inability to speak or understand language except the order to kill, Dietfried brought her home with him. Upon returning, Gilbert and Dietfried reunited after a long time. To celebrate Gilbert's promotion to a major, Dietfried \"gave\" Violet to Gilbert and was ordered to treat her as a weapon without any mercy or compassion. Since Dietfried couldn't nor wanted to handle Violet by himself, he entrusted his younger brother with that task. Gallery. &lt;tabber&gt; Anime= Light Novel= &lt;\/tabber&gt;"}

He thinks it strange that he is considered a war criminal to the point that it angers him greatly. He claims that he killed a lot of people and committed crimes because he was ordered to do so.

{"url":"https:\/\/violet-evergarden.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=158","text":"Gilbert Bougainvillea is a character in the \"Violet Evergarden\" series. He is a major in the Leidenschaftlich army and the only one who really valued Violet, seeing her as a human being rather than a tool, contrary to his brother Dietfried, who saw Violet merely as a weapon for war. Appearance. Gilbert is a man with a tall stature, thin waist, broad shoulders with emerald-green eyes and Dark blue hair, which are common traits for men of the Bougainvillea family. He has a scar on his left cheek and one just above his left eye. He has short, slicked-back hair with several locks falling freely and framing his face. He looks very similar to his late father, as they are both considered attractive, but have a \"stodgy look\" to their face. His uniform consists of a purplish-black outfit paired with burgundy linen shoulder pads and a decorative accordion-pleated cloth glistening around his hips and buttoned up to his neck. After surviving the war, Gilbert receives a maneuverable prosthetic arm made of metal. He also begins wearing a black eye patch over his right eye due to losing vision in it. Personality. Gilbert is a reserved, stoic and stern man who is stated to be incapable of loving anyone or being loved by someone else. Being a soldier, Gilbert was required to suppress his sentiments and pleasures, so he feels like he isn't allowed to show his genuine emotions. He feels like he cannot say what he wants to; he didn't have the right to nor does he think that he deserves to. Because of that, he thought that his heart would be relieved if he earnestly put his thoughts into words. When he doesn't, however, feelings of guilt, regret, bitterness, frustration, anger, and sorrow would mix in his head. Gilbert is a stressed individual, and the frustration of things not going as he wanted would seethe within his head and burst out. He also has a bad habit of ignoring the pain of his conscience and pushing it to the back of his mind. However, when he says something he genuinely wants to say, it gives him a peculiar feeling likely caused by finally being able to muster out his most honest sentiments. He somehow feels that everything has been forgiven by confessing his feelings of care towards Violet. Gilbert had an aptitude for the military, and he never felt any anxiety or fear when receiving promotions in the army. He thinks that God had bestowed him with a destiny that matched him perfectly. Gilbert has always felt like there was nothing he wanted to do nor a place he thought he could go to. He had come as far as he had by acting as expected of a child born into the noble Bougainvillea military family, hence he is rather envious of his friends who energetically speak about their dreams. Gilbert has very few things that he likes, and there\u2019s a much bigger number of things that he detests. He simply doesn't say it, but he is not fond of his lifestyle. He states that although he does protect his country, he dislikes the world. He claims that the things he likes are his best friend Hodgins, his inevitably twisted family, and Violet Evergarden. According to Hodgins, despite being a \"pampered rich kid,\" he has a calm and warm personality with a real character to him. Sometimes, he does have a chilly and blunt personality though, especially when people question the obvious. Gilbert is also acquiescent, but that does not apply to everyone. However, he is also wise and has a strong sense of right and wrong and possesses real empathy. He is not merciless like his brother and is a compassionate and caring man who cherishes the ones he cares for, as he puts their safety above his own. Gilbert is deeply kind and carries strong morals with him, as he believes that his brother's actions in turning Violet into a weapon were sickening. This is why he offered Violet warmth and kindness, something that she had never experienced before. History. Early life. Gilbert was born into an upper-class family worshipped as national heroes, the Bougainvillea family. From a young age, Gilbert and his older brother Dietfried were trained rigorously by their father to become soldiers once they grew up, as it was customary for men from the Bougainvillea family to enlist in the army. At some point, after Dietfried left the army and joined the Navy, it fell to Gilbert to become the 26th generation boss of the Bougainvillea family. Served in the army. Gilbert joined the Leidenschaftlich Army and ever since enlisting, he had been integrated into the army attacking unit. He was sent to the battlefield at the age of seventeen and fought for around eight years, only returning to his motherland a few times a year. Four years prior to the main events of the story, an abandoned Violet was found on the battlefront by Gilbert's older brother, Dietfried. Upon returning, Violet was \"given\" to Gilbert as a gift to commemorate his promotion, having been promoted to a major in light of his wartime achievements and expectations from his bloodline. Dietfried, not wanting to take care of Violet, pushed this task to his younger brother. Seeing how harshly his brother treated the young Violet, Gilbert immediately grabbed her and pulled her into his embrace to shield her. Gilbert then decided to enlist her into the military unit that he had been appointed to take overall command of in his promotion to major. He later received permission to conduct private experiments at the training grounds as to whether Violet could be officially classified as a \"weapon.\" Even though Gilbert was ordered to treat Violet as a tool with no mercy and compassion, Gilbert was strongly against his brother's cruel behavior towards Violet and instead treated her with kindness. He taught her speech, words, and gave her the name \"Violet\" in hopes that she would grow into a woman as beautiful as the flower. Even though Gilbert wanted to grant her parents to raise her appropriately, he couldn't, since he was scared of her killing someone without his knowledge. He just wanted her to grow as a person, and as she grew up, be able to become something more than a \"tool\". Gilbert and Violet fought in the war together; Violet, the \"weapon\", and Gilbert, her \"user\". Operation regain Intense. During the war, Gilbert's unit is assigned to stage an attack on the enemy's headquarters, the success of which could mean the end of the war. They were able to seize headquarters and signal the main force to attack, but under this time, the whole unit suffered heavy casualties. Gilbert, who was in a near-death state, told Violet to leave him behind and escape to give her a chance of surviving, which Violet stubbornly refused despite having lost her arms. But after Gilbert's pleading for her to stop, she gave in. He then told Violet that he wanted her to be free and live happily, not as a tool, but as a regular human being, and to find a real home. Before succumbing to his injuries, he confessed that he loved Violet from the bottom of his heart. After the war. After the final battle, Gilbert miraculously survived and awoke in a hospital bed run by a monastery, having lost both his right eye and arm. Upon recovering, he worked there for a while, helping around the place where he witnessed the numerous casualties of the war. Instead of returning home or notifying the Leidenschaftlich military, Gilbert roamed around for several years until he eventually discovered and journeyed to Ekarte, an island previously occupied by Gardarik and worked as a school teacher. Story. Gilbert miraculously survived the war, but at the cost of one of his arms and his right eye. In order for Violet to not go back to the way she used to be, only following his orders and acting as his tool, Gilbert entrusted Hodgins with taking care of Violet. Gilbert also told Hodgins to tell Violet that he was dead, but Hodgins didn't have the heart to tell her at first. Gilbert then secretly continued his life in the army, and he was later promoted to colonel. Relationships. Violet Evergarden. Gilbert was \"gifted\" with a young Violet, a meeting in which he immediately embraced her. Gilbert states that from the moment he embraced her, their destinies intertwined. Although Gilbert was ordered to treat her as a tool, Gilbert treated her with kindness and compassion instead. He was the one who taught her speech, writing, and emotions, and during the four years they spent together by bonding over different things, the two grew very close. Although Gilbert was initially scared of Violet's ability to kill, he states that he would not entrust her to anyone, he would \"raise\" her appropriately by himself in hopes of her becoming a girl fitting of the name he gave her. As time went on, Gilbert grew to love Violet, seemingly as a father would love his daughter, which is demonstrated by how happy he would become whenever she would call \"Major\". He also believed that he had to protect her, and felt like his chest pounded with immutable devotion towards her. He is portrayed to love Violet as his own kin, having raised her from a young age, and teaching her all she knows about the world. After acknowledging that he loved her, he ceased attempting to drag her into war, but he couldn't since he was forced by his superiors to put her on the frontlines due to her combat abilities. He wished for her to become something more than a tool, for her to find a place to belong and to live on. He cares for her deeply, he doesn't want for her to be hurt, only yearning for her happiness and well-being. During the war when both of them were in a near death-state, Gilbert finally confessed that he loved Violet from the bottom of his heart, to which he also expressed his desire for Violet to escape from the military in order to become free. He confided in her how she would be fine, even if he wasn't around, and Gilbert, who had never felt like wanted to do anything with his life, later came to understand that teaching what love is to the girl who didn't know it was, was his life\u2019s purpose. Gilbert was the first person to show Violet what love is, just as most children\u2019s first experience of love is from their own parents as well. It is thanks to Gilbert and his words, \"I love you\" that gave Violet the motivation to live on and understand the meaning behind his words. Gilbert describes Violet as the only person he has ever loved in his life, and that she is very important to him. Suffering from the guilt of having treated Violet as a tool causes Gilbert to even become suicidal during matters that concern her, such as when he asked Hodgins to kill him if she had died in the war or when he briefly considered shooting himself after being led to believe Violet found out about his survival and despised him for it. Although Gilbert lied about his own death, it was only out of love for Violet, in hopes that she would find her own path in life rather than follow his orders forever. After their reunion, Gilbert is still very much in love with Violet, and she, as well, has come to understand the concept \"love\" and her feelings towards him slightly better. However, Gilbert decides to wait for Violet until she truly understands the words \"I love you\", and he wants her to, when that time comes, for her to accept his love. Claudia Hodgins. Gilbert and Hodgins have been best friends ever since they attended an officer academy together while serving in the Leidenschaftlich army. Gilbert respects Hodgins greatly as a superior in the army, but would act chilly towards him while Hodgins would tease and face him in an energetic manner. Such was the relationship between the old friends. Like everyone who has dreams though, Gilbert felt slightly envious of Hodgins when he spoke of his dreams since he himself didn't have anything he wanted to do. However, Gilbert really does cherish Hodgins, as he claims that Hodgins is the only man in his life that he has called his \"best friend\u201d. He is also one of the few people Gilbert genuinely likes and considers precious. They would always help each other whenever anything would happen, and they might have been more familiar with one another than with their own parents. That is the proof that Gilbert trusts Hodgins so much that he entrusted him with the care of Violet once the war was over. Dietfried Bougainvillea. His older brother. Although Gilbert seemed different from Dietfried, they were alike deep down. Both viewed things empirically, determined exactly what was currently happening, and tried to deal with it in the best way. Since Gilbert could not love anyone due to being too stern, his elder brother had everything he lacked, to the point of making him infinitely envious as a fellow human being. Although Gilbert does have mixed feelings towards his brother for treating Violet the way he did, the brothers do have a deep connection between them. Despite their different personalities and outlooks on life, Dietfried has stated numerous times how dear Gilbert is to him, and how much he loves him. Mr. Bongainvillea. Gilbert's father always had an extremely strict relationship with raising his children, making them undergo exhausting training and not accepting continuous defeats in fencing or even low grades in homeschooling, since they will carry the surname of the Bougainvilliea family, serving in the army by Leidenschaftlich.

Since it's a rainy day, the two of them spend the day indoors. Gilbert flashes back to the day he visited his room at the military academy before school began. His parents didn't accompany him, and his brother had already run off to the naval academy. He sees other young men enjoying their lives and thinks about how if he complained about his responsibilities, he would be cut off from his family. In the present day, Gilbert and Violet go to a park to have a picnic. They talk about the lack of security in riding hot air balloons, as well as the time that they had to eat one of their military horses for survival. In the past, Gilbert went on a date with his fianc\u00e9e at a cafe, but it was clear that neither of them were interested in each other. Gilbert would rather hang out with his first ever friend, Hodgins. His fianc\u00e9e asked him to convince his parents to cancel the engagement. In the present day, Gilbert buys a bouquet of roses and gives them to Violet. Gilbert recalls buying Violet her emerald brooch and his anguish over only teaching her how to kill and nothing about beauty. In the present day, the two are buying rings at a jewelry store. Despite the happy occasion, Gilbert feels that something is off. He then realizes that Violet's arms are not prostheses. The jewelry store vanishes, and Gilbert is convinced that their happy memories never existed. He feels a complicated mix of emotions over his relationship with Violet and his lack of guilt for what he did to her, and then finally wakes up in the real world. Gilbert wakes up alone, but recalls his terrible dream. He is almost resigned to following the path set out for him by his family when Violet knocks on his door, back from shopping for breakfast. Gilbert kisses her and tells her that he had a terrible dream. Violet confesses that she also has dreams where she is trying to find him but fails. Gilbert realizes that they are alike, and that he fears nothing now that he has his greatest love."}

The mountain ranges that penetrate the continent at east and west and the ones extending from north to south cross one another in the central part of the mainland and become one. Since the place looked like the world\u2019s spine as seen from anywhere in the surroundings, it was thought in the Old Genesis mythology to be the backbone of the Great Land\u2019s Mother Goddess as she created the continent by lying down. It is also the origin of many fountainheads of rivers that extend to all over the continent, and from that it was thought to be a source that brought fertility to the earth. Furthermore, as most of the central part consists of the continent\u2019s highest mountain peaks, it is a land of faith since time immemorial and became a sacred ground the majority of the continent\u2019s religions before anyone realized it. Background. On the land that resided in the highest mountain peak was built the pilgrimage city of Intense, which became one country by integrating neighboring lands, yet it was but a sacred ground open to the whole world, as well as a neutral place that did not belong to any power. However, a religious nation, the Salbert Holy State, was unable to tolerate Intense becoming a foreign country, attempting to raid it many times. For that reason, they conspired along the Galdarik Empire, which was running short on food and resources and aiming for opportunities to invade the South, forming an alliance with the involved neighboring countries and declaring war against the Southern Union. The Galdarik Empire\u2019s side detained Intense, which was a mountainous region, and claimed that it would rush into and occupy Leidenschaftlich in one strike, but as the Salbert Holy State had the occupation of Intense as its primary target to the very last, the military had no interest in moving out of the mountainous region, so the advancement of its attacks decreased, giving the Southern Union time to build a defense net. Additionally, although the main force of the Northern Alliance had occupied the intense, the Sarbelt Soviet Army had suspended any further attacks, so the front lines agglutinated even more."}

Contrary to the North\u2019s expectations, the war in which the northern countries of Telsis Continent had abruptly opposed to the southern ones, rich in natural resources and agricultural products, had ended up turning into a large-scale one that involved all of the continent\u2019s nations and lasted for too long a period. As a result, each country entered a regime of complete mobilization and the labor force responsible for the national economies drastically diminished.

Since the military was a bureaucratic organization, a large number of documents was required for safe operations, and they were in charge of processing them.

It is one of the locations in the \"Violet Evergarden\" series, and the location where Violet fought in the war. The continent of Telsis has a wide elliptical shape towards the east and west, and situated in its south central region is Leidenschaftlich. Its capital, Leiden, is located along its south-eastern coast. As the climate is hot and humid during summer and warm and rainy during winter, the productivity of its agriculture is high, especially through the utilization of the abundant water resources on multiple croppings, mainly of rice. The ocean current is strong in the south coast of the continent, but the vicinity of Leidenschaftlich is composed of a vast bay with several natural good harbors, which is the trade center of the south of the continent. History. Since the old times, Leidenschaftlich had been invaded repeatedly by neighbor countries that aimed for its ports and natural resources, sometimes suffering many defeats, and sometimes having even its capital invaded by enemy armies. Because many countries would not survive economically if trading services were to stop in Leidenschaftlich, there were just as many threats from foreign enemies targeting the motherland. If one studied the country\u2019s history, they would find it to be mostly recordings of battles against invaders. Due to those experiences, the capital city of Leiden was surrounded by long and solid double walls, and the proximity of the borders had a frontier with its own military capability as an immediate fighting force, striving to defend the country. Yet, as the regional aristocracy of the border arms and surrounding rural aristocrats became the core of the national defense, domestic voices became stronger, and in contrast, the central royalty weakened. As a result, the current regime was a parliamentary cabinet system centered in the House of Lords, and the royal family, too, was converted into an aristocracy. However, as the previous Great War had been a large-scale one involving the whole continent, it was difficult for the aristocratic army of until that time to respond, so as national forces that had been assembled in a hurry became active, the right for the masses to participate in the government went under consideration.

Due to many continuous conflicts, sharpening Leidenschaftlich's defenses became a necessity. They would flexibly incorporate the cultures and weapons of other countries earned through trading and make use of them while incessantly improving them. Those experiences turned Leidenschaftlich into a military nation renowned throughout the entire continent, known as such even by citizens of other countries. Inhabitants. Within Leidenschaftlich is a household that had existed since its foundation \u2013 Bougainvillea, a family whose ancestors are worshipped as national heroes. Its beginning was marked by the family head of the first generation, Ratchet, who became a patriot devoted to the salvation of his country through driving a myriad of raiders away with his sword skills and military strategies, consequently saving many people. Following the grandeur of their predecessors, it was a tradition in the Bougainvillea family to have its children join the army as a matter of course. This tradition has not changed even in current times, with the 26th generation ruling over the household. The current head of the family is Gilbert Bougainvillea."}

Leon was raised in the arms of Mount Eustitia; he had always watched the night sky, leading a life of ever been addicted to astronomy.

Before leaving, she promised Leon she would come back with Leon's father. When she didn\u2019t, Leon had been sad for being abandoned by his mother. From there on, Leon developed a hatred towards women, since he claimed they lived and died for love, describing them as extremely selfish. His mother's actions left a permanent scar on him. Leon joined the Shaher Astronomical Headquarter's Manuscript Division at a young age. However, what he really wanted was to work in the acquisition department like his father. He felt that his mother, along with his father, would return to him if he waited there for them.

He believed that it was possible for him to fulfill his dreams at the Observatory until he met Violet, who changed his mind. Story. Violet, along with a number of other Dolls, arrive at the Shaher Observatory in order to help the scholars make copies of a number of rare books. Violet is paired with the scholar Leon, who initially dislikes her and Dolls in general. However, he is impressed with how quickly she works, and together, they finish a three-days worth work in a day. Eventually, he begins to soften up to Violet. He also invites her to view Alley's Comet with him, which only appears once every two hundred years, and she accepts. While the two stargaze, Leon explains that his father was also a scholar at the observatory but disappeared on an expedition. His mother then left home to search for him and never returned either, causing Leon to resent them and the concept of love. Violet, in turn, tells Leon about her devotion towards Gilbert, to which Leon realizes Violet is in love with Gilbert. The next morning, Violet is preparing to leave now that her job is complete. Leon sees her off and tells her that instead of waiting at the observatory for his parents to return, he'll start traveling the world like Violet to go look for them. As Violet leaves, Leon wonders if he'll ever encounter her again. Sometime after that, Leon began traveling around the world just like he had promised. At one point, he met Violet again under the moonlight in a desolate land he did not even know the name of. When he asked her if she had memorized the name of at least a few stars, Violet nodded. Leon then thinks what an amazing day it is for a reunion, and asks Violet to spend some time watching the stars with him. Relationships. Mother. For his young self, his mother was his entire world. Were she not already there from the start, she was his outright guardian from the moment he had been born until he had become aware of the things around him. She would find him whenever he ran off crying and praise him whenever he did something good. Whenever he would reach out his hand, she would embrace him. Leon\u2019s mother had told him about how green was an extremely rare hair color, which is why he was so special and precious. All of these statements are why Leon would never have thought that she would be gone one day. After his mother abandoned him, Leon was very sad and hated himself for wanting to be keeping watch on that door where she left him. His mother's action made him hate women and love in general, this left a scar on him, resulting in him becoming cold. Despite that, Violet notes that Leon presumably still considers his mother very dear to him. Violet Evergarden. He is partnered with Violet when his employer pairs researchers and Auto Memories Dolls together for a collection of research pieces. Although he is cold and blunt to her in the beginning, he is impressed with how quickly she works and begins to soften when he sees that she doesn't care about his background or upbringing as an orphan. Because of how similar they are, it makes it easy for them to sympathize with each other. Due to this reason, Leon starts to develop feelings for Violet (his feelings are implied in the anime), which is emphasized by the fact that he seen to be amazed by her beauty, starts acting very nervous and flustered in her presence, and longing to see her. Before Violet's departure, Leon musters up his courage and confesses his feelings towards Violet. However, since Violet doesn't understand love very well and already has someone else very dear to her, she couldn't accept his confession. Despite this, she is seen to be happy by his confession, to which Leon accepts and is content with. He then tells Violet that instead of waiting for his parents to come home, he will expedite around the world like her. And he wants her to, if they would ever meet again, to watch the stars with him, to which Violet gives him her word. After that, Leon was sure that he would not hesitate any more, because she had given him the courage to move forward. He was also sure he would no longer despise anyone for closing a door with their back turned to him, such was the result of making a promise to Violet. When they meet again, Leon is aware that he is still in love with Violet and that his feelings towards her would not budge, but he decides to put that fact aside and ask her to watch the stars with him instead.

After becoming a Doll, she wears her hair in a high ponytail with a golden band. Personality. Luculia is constructed as a kind and considerate person who is willing to go out of her way to assist others, shown by events such as her offering Violet Evergarden some of her food the first day they met or attempting to help her write a letter to Gilbert Bougainvillea. Despite a tragic backstory, she is shown to carry a positive attitude and cheerful demeanor when around other people, but tends to be more quiet and solemn when alone. She is expressive and sociable, but she struggles to communicate her own feelings, particularly regarding her brother. She always looks to assist others in any way she can and can be described as selfless. History. Luculia had a normal yet very peaceful childhood with her parents and older brother, Spencer Marlborough. When the war began, Spencer was drafted into the army. However, there wasn't much fighting on the Western Front where Spencer was located, so Luculia claims that the war didn't feel real to them. However, one day when Luculia's parents went to a town for business, the Western Front was broken through, and her parents were killed in the fighting. After the war ended, Spencer came back alive, which was more than enough to make Luculia happy despite their parents' deaths. However, Spencer blamed himself for the deaths of their parents, and fell into depression and alcoholism, after which Luculia began taking care of Spencer. Story.

{"url":"https:\/\/violet-evergarden.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=165","text":"Lux Sibyl is a character of the \"Violet Evergarden\" light novel series. She was formerly worshipped as a demigod and secluded from the outside world at \"Utopia\" on the island of Chevalier. She was eventually rescued by Violet and now works at the CH Postal Company. She is Hodgins' secretary and becomes Violet's first tea friend. Appearance. Lux is a young girl with a petite build and pale skin. She is described by her peers to be unique in appearance, as she has different colored eyes: the left eye being the color of amber and the right eye being brown. Her long, wavy, lavender-gray hair reaches down to her lower back with messy bangs that cover her forehead. While residing in Utopia, she wears a gold-colored circlet and a long, black dress with a black collar and golden trims. After becoming an employee at the CH Postal Company, she cut her hair to a lower-chin length bob cut. She also began to wear glasses, a scarf around her neck, and a golden barrette attached to the left side of her head, which gives her the impression of being a professional working lady. Personality. Lux is a very calm, gentle, and strong girl. She is well-behaved, soft-spoken, and polite as a result of being raised and worshipped as a demigod. Despite that, she felt very lonely due to being an orphan and due to being left out of the religious cult she was a part of. She later came to understand that she felt trapped on the island and wished to escape, but she felt like she couldn't due to being a demigod. It was a situation that she, who only spent her days thinking about when scary times would be over, could not cope with. Lux was afraid of herself for being almost similar to the people of Utopia; having a twisted reasoning and mentality. She was self-deprecating and lacked self-confidence because the nuns who treated her so gently would forget about her once she was gone and find a new demigod to worship. Lux felt that she was not truly loved or cherished by anyone, that there was nothing good in the place she stayed in, and that she could not trust anybody. She felt like everything was scary; she was afraid of venturing into the outside world. Lux claims that she was afraid of dying, yet thought that living was as frightening as dying. She saw herself as someone useless who would be troubled if she stepped into the outside world. She stated that other girls her age knew all kinds of things and had a family, friends, and a place to belong, yet Lux felt like she had nothing. She was no more than a cowardly child who continuously immersed in despair within the darkness she was confined, who had been watching other people die without being able to intervene. She initially wanted to die at Utopia, as she claimed that she couldn't live in the outside world at this point. However, after she was rescued by Violet, who was very much similar to her, Lux gains the motivation to live and decides to start a new path in her life. After that incident, Lux immediately fixed her way of thinking. After becoming an employee of the CH Postal Company, Lux finally gets a place that she can belong to. She claims that it was not as if she had forgotten her past, but she had no intention of continuing to engage in it. Because, the Lux who was a demigod of Roses had died back then, and the current Lux was an employee of a postal company. She also becomes more self-confident and cheerful, as she is not afraid to speak her mind or scolds her co-workers when they make mistakes. Despite having a young appearance, on the inside, Lux is a completely capable secretary. However, Lux states that she still has difficulty in understanding how things work in the world and that she is merely climbing up the stairs of adulthood. She is deeply grateful towards Violet, Hodgins and the postal company for taking her in and tries to repay them as much as possible. She is shown to be a responsible and hardworking girl. History. Lux is an orphan who did not know her origins nor her parents. When she was seven years old, people from the religious cult of Utopia found her after they had heard rumors about her appearance and went to where she was, to which they saw that she was the spitting image of the goddess of knowledge, Roses. They thought that she fell to the Earth after being birthed by the goddess Roses. The main purpose of Utopia\u2019s activities was to further the diffusion and worshipping of worldwide mythology, and to dedicate their strength to the preservation of \"demigods\". This is why Lux was worshipped as a \"demigod\" in Utopia. Lux was secluded from the outside world and was forbidden to go out in order to become a good demigod. She had a relatively normal life and received an education, but Lux never realized that she was always like a caged bird until Violet came along. Story. After being rescued, Lux was taken by Violet to her workplace, the CH Postal Company, and started living there. At first, she was only in charge of phone calls, but within a year, she became the president\u2019s personal secretary, leading a restless everyday life."}

She is the beloved late daughter of Oscar and the insipration behind Olive, the main character in her father's first children's play. Appearance. Olivia was a young girl with fair skin, brown eyes, and blonde hair; all of these traits inherited from her mother. Her straight hair was shoulder-length, which she styled in two buns on either side of her head. After becoming sick, Olivia's appearance changed drastically. She lost her hair, which is why she often wore a hat, and she grew much thinner. Personality. According to her father, Olivia was a very cheerful and kind girl. Even after her mother died, she didn't show her loneliness and sadness, instead remaining positive. She was a very responsible girl who would help out so her father could focus on his work. Olivia loved her father deeply and was very attached to him. After she became sick, she grew emotionally and physically weak, but with the help of her father, Olivia was able to spend the last days of her life in peace and happiness. History. Olivia was an only child born to Oscar Webster and his wife. Together, the three lived a happy life. When Olivia's mother died due to illness, however, Oscar and Olivia moved to their summer home in Roswell and began living there. Although both of them were sad due to death of Olivia's mother, they helped each other out and remained happy. One day, in the hospital\u2019s premises, Olivia saw a fountain that looked like an oasis with floating leaves on the water\u2019s surface, in which she had commented on how pretty they were. She then promised her father that, with the help of the frilly parasol she loved so much, she would try crossing the nearby lake by walking on the decayed leaves that fell onto the water. Olivia's mother's best friend had taken care of Olivia and her father after her mother's death. She would help both of them and would also braid Olivia's hair. However, it was later learned that Olivia had inherited the same disease as her mother, which caused her blood vessels to clot rapidly. They relied solely on famous and unmatched doctors, unlike when her mother had gone through the same hardship. They went from hospital to hospital, asking for help and gathering information for testing new drugs. In the end, the medics had given up and declared her incurable. Being on their own again after Olivia's mother's friend distanced herself from the two, Oscar had an argument with one of the doctors so that Olivia could come back home and take nothing but painkillers. From then on, there had been a little bit of peace, and Oscar saw Olivia smile for the first time in a while. They spent the last days of Olivia's life in gentle harmony in their home. Upon having a coughing fit, Olivia passed away. Legacy. Oscar buried Olivia in the same cemetery as her mother. After years of mourning for his daughter and wife, Oscar decided to write a children's story about Olive, a young girl based on Olivia, to finish the incomplete story he had told Olivia when she was alive. In doing so, Oscar requests Violet to put his ideas on paper. Later, he also asks Violet to cross the lake close by walking on decayed leaves on the water in order to fulfill the promise he exchanged with Olivia in the past. In doing so, Violet inspires Oscar with the idea of Olive using her magical parasol to fly home to her father. After a touching \"reunion\" between the two where Olivia is seen smiling at her father, Oscar comes to terms with his daughter's death."}

It is also included in the story collection \"Violet Evergarden ~Last Letter~.\" Summary. Oscar visits the orphanage on the border of Drossel and Flugel to take part in a story-telling session. After the session is over, a young girl named Angela asks if she can be his daughter. Oscar tries to politely turn her down by saying that he already has a family who he carries around in his heart, but Angela is persistent. She asks to write him letters, and he reluctantly agrees. Since then, Angela sends him several letters a month despite the fact that Oscar's replies are usually curt. The letters are sent in beautifully painted envelopes. Oscar eventually becomes attached to her through their letter exchanges and thought that it was a waste that a girl with such literary talents should be left in an orphanage. Angela had told him that she had been returned to the orphanage by her adoptive parents three times. Oscar stops short of inviting her to live with him. One day, the letter exchange ends, and Oscar finds out from the orphanage's nuns that Angela has been adopted. Oscar feels crushed. Oscar goes to another story-telling session a year after Angela stops writing letters. Oscar learns from the nuns that Angela was half-forcefully adopted by a wealthy family after they saw one of her artworks on display in their gallery and wanted to adopt her in order to train her as an artist. The nuns, worried, had tried to visit her, but were told by Angela to go home or her father will get angry. It's suspected that Angela might be being physically punished by the head of the family. Angered, Oscar goes to the wealthy family's mansion, located near their gallery. There, Oscar sees a landscape painting on display and realizes that Angela had been painting on the envelopes she had sent her letters in and he never realized it.

However, after deciding to write his very first children's play to dedicate it to his daughter's memory, he entrusts Violet with the task of putting his ideas on paper. Appearance. Oscar is a man in the prime of his life. He has unkempt red hair with a curl and wears thick, black-rimmed glasses over his olive-green eyes. His back is slightly hunched, but his face lends him an air of youthfulness. Personality. Oscar describes himself as a normal man with many quirks, and someone who is not fit to be the protagonist in any sort of story. After the deaths of his wife and daughter, he became severely depressed and even left his name in the industry. He also became lazy, dissolute, and grief-indulged. He was rather pessimistic and believes that humans are creatures that easily become tired of being sad or happy, and cannot continuously be either forever. He despised the ugly reality of the world, which is why he started drinking. However, thanks to the assistance of a doctor, he was able to overcome the alcohol and drugs, but was left with a tremor in his hand. Oscar kept to himself and was very secluded from the rest of the world. He did not read newspapers or magazines and rarely hung out with anyone. Other than his friends, the only people he had contact with were cashiers and deliverymen. He was very self-loathing and felt extremely guilty for being the only member of his family left alive, wishing instead to die along with them. Despite that, he has shown to be a responsible, supporting, and kind man with a playful side to him. He also deeply loved his wife and daughter when they were alive, as he was seen to be very selfless and would often put their happiness above his own. His family meant everything to him. Although he wanted to get back to the writing industry again to honor Olivia's, his daughter's memory, he simply could not progress properly. The desire to write, however, had remained in his chest. Eventually, with the help of Violet, Oscar successfully writes a play and comes to terms with his daughter's death and that he is alive. After recovering, Oscar returned to the playwright industry, now appearing as a happier man. History. At some point in his life, Oscar married his wife and together, they had one daughter, Olivia. The three lived a happy life together in a villa until Oscar's wife was diagnosed with an illness that caused her blood vessels to clot rapidly, resulting in her death. Moreover, it was hereditary, and his wife had inherited it from her father. At her funeral, one question had constantly echoed in Oscar\u2019s head: \u201cWhy?\u201d After the death of his wife, Oscar and Olivia moved to their summer home in Roswell and began living there. Although both of them were sad due to death of Oscar's wife, they helped each other out and remained happy. One day, Olivia saw a fountain that looked like an oasis, and on the water\u2019s surface, leaves coming from the surroundings had been floating. She had commented on how pretty they were. She then promised her father that she would try to cross the lake close to their house by walking on the decayed leaves that fell on the water. Oscar states that he would wait as long as it would take. Oscar's wife\u2019s best friend was an auspicious person, and as he had lost spirit with the death of his wife, she had energetically taken care of him and his daughter. She would prepare warm meals for Oscar and braid Olivia's hair. Oscar thinks there may have been a bit of one-sided love involved. After learning that Olivia had inherited her mother's disease, they relied solely on famous and unmatched doctors, unlike when his wife had gone through the same hardship.

After years of mourning for his daughter and wife, Oscar had been approached by a colleague from his former job, who had asked him if he could write a screenplay again. For Oscar, a request from a theatre group that everyone admired was an honor. Oscar had accepted the offer with an immediate feedback, deciding to hold onto a pen once more. However, it was from then that his problem had started. Whether he wrote on paper or with a typewriter, he simply could not properly progress. As he had asked for advice from the old work colleague that had made him the request, the latter had told him to use an Auto Memories Doll. Oscar requests the use of a Doll, which tasks Violet to assist Oscar in writing his next play. However, she arrives to find him a drunk recluse. Violet manages to convince Oscar to suspend his drinking while they work, and they begin writing the play. The play is about a girl named Olive who uses her power to summon magical sprites to defeat a beast, but in doing so sacrifices her ability and becomes stranded away from her home and father. Violet becomes curious about how the story will end, which Oscar hasn't decided upon yet. Violet then finds a parasol, triggering an angry outburst from Oscar. He then admits to Violet that he based Olive off of his daughter Olivia, who had died from illness, and he is trying to write the play as a way to cope with his grief over her loss. Oscar then requests Violet to cross the lake close by walking on decayed leaves on the water, in order to get inspiration and to fulfill the promise he exchanged with his daughter in the past. In doing so, Violet inspires Oscar with the idea of Olive using her magical parasol to fly home to her father. Oscar then comes to terms with his daughter's death and thanks Violet, successfully creating a play with a happy ending. Oscar is later seen to have returned to the industry and is now working hard to make a real play out of his story script about Olive."}

Its whole territory is something to be contemplated. However, amongst influential people, Roswell is known for its summerhouses \u2013 in other words, its holiday villas. It is a beautiful, bucolic capital surrounded by greenery. Overview. The majority of the Genetrix country is plain regions, but there are relatively high mountains in the south, by the edge of the mountain range extending from the central mountainous district. Located at the mountain-foot is the city of Roswell, which is well-known as a summer refuge. It is famous as a sightseeing place, along with the neighboring country of Drossel, brimming with beautiful four seasons and nature as its bucolic scenery seems to spread on forever with the flowers that bloom in spring, whether that was cool even during summer, stunning autumnal leaves from temperate deciduous forests that are rare even in those surroundings, and abundant snow. In addition, it is also used as a land of villas, not only by the locals but also by rich people of nearby nations. The urban areas are the most preferred for tourism, and since the gorgeous cityscape is protected by landscape regulations, the villas are built far away in order to create an air of luxury. Behind such city is the holiday house of a dramatist whose name reverberated throughout the continent, Oscar. In spring, the mountains and rivers with overflowing flowers entertain people\u2019s eyes. In summer, many seek the biggest waterfall, which is a touristic point, to learn about local history. In autumn, everyone\u2019s hearts are struck by the rain of decaying leaves. In winter, the scenery is enveloped in a silent tranquility. As the transition of the four seasons is very easily distinguishable, it's a land that has more than enough to offer for the delight of those who visit during the change of periods for sightseeing. Many villas had been built linked to the mountain-foot town, which consists of wooden cottages painted in a variety of colors. From the smallest to the biggest lots, the cost of land in the area is quite a large sum, and therefore, having a villa be made there is a proof of wealth in itself. The city is crammed with shops for tourists. On holidays, the main street interconnected to said shops becomes crowded, pleasant tunes playing in the background. With such assortment, no one can make fun of the place, even with it being the countryside. People usually build villas in the city for the sake of convenience, and anyone who builds one anywhere else is viewed as an eccentric outcast."}

The personnel at Shaher\u2019s headquarters in Eustitia manage books about every known star, collected from all over the world. Having been established as the annex of the astronomical observatories, the headquarters safeguards a gigantic library. Every one of its books is about stars and the myths related to them. History. The Shaher Astronomy HQ was named after a maritime navigation king that had managed to get his hands on enormous amounts of wealth during his lifetime: Shaher. Observatories that had been erected in many places under influence of the deceased Shaher\u2019s hobbies still existed, as a courtesy of the continuous sustenance from his family group. Known Employees. The people who work there are in charge of diverse tasks, such as arranging classifications, providing assistance for visitors, and decoding the ancient writing of foreign literature pieces. Among them, the one said to be the least appealing job is in the manuscripts department, which preserves books so old they're on the verge of deterioration. Just as the name indicates, it is the department where already-published handwritten books are transcribed into a typewritten format. Rooms. In the atrium room, black iron spiral stairs serve as bridges between each floor, while a gold chandelier forms the image of a star descending from the ceiling.

Although the people from the manuscripts department steadily worked on the manuscripts to an astounding extent every day, they found themselves in the middle of a crisis. The cause was that a large number of astronomy books had been selected out of an ample literary collection purchased from a certain influential family\u2019s warehouse. The great number of volumes was a problem, but even more so was conserving them, given the state they were in. The texts were barely readable and many pages would rip when turned. In addition, the number of people in the manuscripts department was of eighty employees. Even without days off for a whole year, they would still not be done rendering all the manuscripts that had been brought in.

He gained weight after the war despite having had a more muscular and slim build. Personality. Spencer is a drunkard and is constantly seen in a drunken state. He often gets kicked out of bars and is therefore seen getting involved with a lot of fights. After the war, it is also apparent that he grew more short-tempered and easily loses his cool.

He believes himself responsible for his parents' deaths, causing him to be depressed and have low self-confidence. However, later on, he eventually slowly recovers and starts to appreciate Luculia's thankfulness for him coming back home. History. Spencer had a normal, yet very peaceful childhood with his parents and younger sister, Luculia. When the war broke out, Spencer got drafted in the army. However, there wasn't much fighting on the Western Front where Spencer was located, so their family claimed that the war didn't feel real to them. All the attacks happened elsewhere, while Spencer was well. However, one day when Spencer's parents went to a town for business, the Western Front was broken, and his parents were killed in the process. After the war ended, Spencer came back alive, which was more than enough to make Luculia happy despite her parents' death. However, Spencer had blamed himself for the death of their parents, so he became a drunkard and depressed, to which Luculia began taking care of him. Story. When Violet and Luculia are one their way home, they encounter Spencer who is outside a bar and is craving beer. The bar owner won't let him and Luculia runs to him and asks him if he drank again.

The following days, Luculia finds Spencer sleeping at home while she takes care of the housework. One day, Spencer gets into a fight with several other men and gets beaten up, and at the same time, Luculia tells Violet how her parents died in the war and about her brother that feels guilty over failing to protect them. She wants to tell her brother that she's just glad he's alive and home, but likewise cannot find the words to say. Violet manages to write a short and concise letter that effectively conveys Luculia's feelings to her brother. At night, an injured Spencer is laying outside reminiscing about his childhood with Luculia when he is suddenly approached by Violet. She shows the letter she wrote which contains Luculia thanking him and her happiness about him coming back from the war, which moves Spencer to tears. The siblings are then able to restore their relationship, and Luculia helps her brother to the top of the bell tower just like he helped her when they were younger, to enjoy the view like they used to as children. Sometime later, Spencer sought Violet out at the CH Postal Company and requested her to write a letter for Luculia in order to thank her for everything she had done for him. However, since Violet was depressed due to the apparent death of Gilbert, she had been absent from work. Despite that, Spencer insisted that it had to be Violet and that he wouldn't want anyone else to write the letter because Violet was able to convey Luculia's feelings for him coming back home from the war. This gave Spencer the motivation to change his life, and he reveals that he had finally found a job thanks to her. When Violet returned to work, she wrote a letter as he had requested. Later, Spencer is seen to give the letter to Luculia, making her overjoyed."}

Violet became an Auto Memories Doll at the CH Postal Company after the war, seeking to understand the meaning of the words \"I love you,\" which was said to her by her major Gilbert Bougainvillea, during the War's final battle. Appearance. Violet is described as a very beautiful young girl, but with some childish facial features given by her young age, which give her a doll-like appearance along with her almost impassive demeanor. She has a slim build of medium height and fair skin; her face is a little narrow and elongated, with large blue eyes and thick dark lashes. The blonde hair ends on her hips, but in front of her face she has a fringe that ends in the middle of the eyebrows divided into three strands: one falls on her face and the remaining two blend into two longer strands that end on the shoulders. Her hair is described as \"velvet\" by Amy as she styled it for her. Often Violet ties them either in a low ponytail tied with a black ribbon, or, when she works as an Auto Memory Doll, in two French braids which she subsequently wraps on themselves and she ties with two red ribbons. Because she lost her arms during the last battle of the war, she was given adamantine silver prostheses, described by herself as \"clumsy, but sturdy\". On normal days, Violet wears a white shirt with a collar that ends at a quarter of the neck and sleeves that get wider but narrow at the cuffs; a leafy green skirt that starts just above her hips with a short fitted sash, and ends at the bottom of her knees; some dark gray tights and a pair of worn warm brown ankle boots. After becoming a Doll, she is often seen in her working attire which consists of a white ribbon-tie dress with a Prussian blue jacket. She also wears a white, pleated silk skirt and an emerald brooch on the middle of the ribbon-tie, which is a gift she received from Gilbert. She also wears brown gloves, and heeled, long leather boots which are of a deep brown. When she goes on longer trips, Violet also carries a brown bag-case and a blue parasol with her. Personality. Violet was educated as a weapon and not a normal human being, which made her expressionless and did not understand human feelings well. She was raised as a person who didn't have feelings, although she does have them; She struggles however, to recognize how someone else might feel. For this reason, she could be mistaken as emotionless, or apathetic. When she was found by Dietfried, Violet couldn't speak or understand speech, except for the order \"Kill\". She did not possess any sense of right or wrong from the start; she didn't understand what could be considered righteous or erroneous. She merely chased after the adults who gave her orders. She followed the mantra of \"kill or be killed,\" thus she could kill without feeling guilt or remorse. She did anything that was asked of her and always followed orders, which was a trait from her life as a soldier. Even after the war ended and she was discharged from the military, Violet had a habit of using words back from her life as a soldier; saluting, disliking being defenseless, and doing tasks without taking any breaks. She also continued to think of herself as a \"tool\" and believed that it would be appropriate to discard her if she can no longer be used as a weapon. However, the one who showed her the life outside of the military was Gilbert. He was the one taught Violet speech, writing and many other things which made her into a slightly more expressive person. Violet is seen to be a persistent, dedicated, and dignified girl, and she is described as someone who is likely to not back away no matter how much others urge her. She has also always been very selfless and determined, which is shown when she refused to leave an injured Gilbert behind, even when she had lost both of her arms. She is shown attempting to drag him up a flight of stairs with her teeth before he tells her to stop. This is also seen when she shielded Dietfried Bougainvillea with her new prosthetic arms, losing one of her arms, and removing a bomb on a hijacked train with only one arm, sacrificing her other arm in the process. Gilbert and Violet had a special bond; she treasures Gilbert very much, which made her want to learn what his words, \"I love you,\" truly meant. In order to do so, she became an Auto Memories Doll, amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper, being moved by the notion. In doing so, Violet made her own decision and followed her own path for the first time in her life. Initially, Violet didn't fully understand other people's feelings and emotions in general, which is why her actions sometimes came off as eccentric and lacking in tact. Although she is polite, careful and deliberate in her actions, Violet came off as insensitive when it came to her job as an Auto Memories Dolls, taking her customers words too literally and formulating their letters in a way that comes off as insulting. She is also blunt and honest, unafraid to speak her mind. She is never above correcting people when they are wrong and always strives for the right answer. According to Cattleya Baudelaire, Violet is a secretive, straight-laced and expressionless person; a woman made of iron who never hesitates when she does something. She describes her as a person whose speech is polite, yet she never flatters anybody. With that, she put a distance between herself and others, but does not show any signs of despising loneliness. But Violet actually knew that she was inexperienced in understanding human emotions, which is why she is constantly trying to find ways to improve her empathy. As a Doll, she always addressed people politely, even when they say bad things to her. She displays a calm, elegant, and firm attitude. Violet is also aloof, expressionless and is said to have the attitude and the presence of a doll. Her expressions are mostly deadpan, so it is hard to tell her mood changes. This is why she sometimes has trouble expressing her own feelings and comes off as expressionless, which makes it difficult to get through her, but she will give a smile from time to time. Through her work as a Doll where she helps people write heartfelt letters, she slowly learns about human emotions, leading her to become more skilled at writing letters and conveying her clients' feelings, as well as becoming understanding of others. She is proven to be a good listener and someone who always thinks about other people's happiness. Due to meeting clients with unique characteristics, Violet began showing new and different emotions more. It is also thanks to her work as an Auto Memories Doll where she came to understand that people's most sincere feelings can be conveyed through writing and letters. This is why she began feeling that no letter deserves to be undelivered, as she herself feels happiness when receiving letters. After growing to understand human emotions, Violet began feeling guilty about having killed so many people in the war. She feels that it's wrong for her to be alive when Gilbert had supposedly died in action, and wonders if it's even okay for her to be alive. Violet also began to understand the words Hodgins told her: that she is on fire and has many burn marks, words that referred to the actions she took in the war. This made her become more apologetic to people close to her, as well as more aware of people's suffering, in which she turns into a much more empathizing and helpful person who does her best to help other people and her clients no matter the difficulties. She feels guilty for people's pain and suffering even though she wasn't the one who caused it. She also came to value the human life a lot, and she made a pledge to never kill anyone else again since she knows that anyone she kills will never be able to convey their feelings to their families and loved ones again. She never wants to go back to being a tool and deems that she doesn't need anyone's orders to live her life anymore, which was a wish that Gilbert had deeply wished for. Towards the end of the series, Violet becomes a fully capable Doll. She also comes to understand the phrase \"I love you\", as well as her own and others emotions and feelings much better, to which she becomes a significantly expressive and happier person. History. Back when she was a child, Violet was found on a deserted island alone after Dietfried Bougainvillea and his comrades' ship became stranded. She didn't have a name at the time, and Dietfried was unsure if she had become orphaned or if she had suffered an accident in the sea just like them. Although Dietfried didn't have any intention of doing anything since he was already annoyed, some of his subordinates approached Violet and attempted to rape her. Before Dietfried was able to stop them, Violet killed them in response. Terrified by her actions, the remaining soldiers all fled, but Violet continued hunting after them. Dietfried and his remaining underlings then decided to kill her, but before they could act, she had already slaughtered everyone except for him. After that, he was pursued by Violet, but she only followed him around and didn\u2019t even attempt to kill him. Dietfried realized that Violet couldn't talk and couldn't understand words. He also concluded that she was the only inhabitant of that island and that the reason she had killed so many people was simply that she was ordered to do it. Once he understood that, Dietfried did repeated experiments. For example, if he pointed to animals or insects and said \"kill,\" she would immediately do so. This also applied to humans. Despite her inability to speak or understand language except the order to kill, Dietfried brought her home with him. Upon returning, Violet was \"given\" to Major Gilbert as a gift to commemorate his promotion by Dietfried. Gilbert then decided to enlist her on a militant unit that he had been appointed to take overall command of in his promotion to major. It was an ideal place to \"raise\" the soldier-like girl Violet while keeping her at an arm's distance. She didn't become a member of Gilbert's unit since a girl not old enough to serve would never be allowed. There were also people who deemed it wrong to have children so close. He later got the permission to conduct private experiments at the training grounds, and the permission as to whether Violet could really be a \u2018weapon\u2019 was granted to him. Leidenschaftlich didn't certificate Violet as a person or give her a registered name, she was only certified as an armament with her \"user\" being Gilbert. However, even though Gilbert was ordered to treat Violet as a tool with no mercy and compassion, Gilbert was strongly against his brother's cruel behavior towards Violet and instead treated her with kindness. He was also the one who taught her speech, words, and gave her the name \"Violet\" in hopes that she would grow into a woman as beautiful as the flower. Even though Gilbert wanted to grant her parents to raise her appropriately, he couldn't, since he was scared of her killing someone without his knowledge. Gilbert's superiors also forced him to put Violet on the front lines due to her combat abilities. Due to that, Gilbert voiced his desire for wanting Violet to grow as a person, and as she grew up, be able to become something more than a \"tool\". Violet fought with Gilbert in the war, where she was a valuable asset who proved to be instrumental in winning many key battles due to her incredible strength and skills. During the war, Gilbert's unit was assigned to stage an attack on the enemy's headquarters, the success of which could mean the end of the war. They were able to seize headquarters and signal the main force to attack, but at this time, the whole unit suffered heavy casualties, and both Gilbert and Violet were shot and exposed to a grenade. Gilbert, who was in a near-death state, told Violet to leave him behind and escape to give her a chance of surviving, which Violet stubbornly refused despite having lost her arms. But after Gilbert's pleading for her to stop, she gave in. Gilbert then told Violet that he wanted her to be free and live happily, not as a tool, but as a regular human being, and to find a real home. Before succumbing to his injuries, he confessed that he loved Violet from the bottom of his heart. After recovering from her injuries when the war ended, Violet was adopted into the Evergarden family in Tiffany Evergarden's care, and she was also taken in by Claudia Hodgins at Gilbert's request and began working at the CH Postal Company as an Auto Memories Doll to understand the meaning behind Gilbert's words. Abilities. Violet is a highly capable and skilled fighter. As a former soldier who was trained from a young age, Violet excelled in combat, and her fighting abilities and strength on the battlefield made her seem more like a \"weapon\" than a human being. She had no problem killing countless others if given the order to do so. Due to her strength and actions taken during the war, Violet came to infamously be known as \"Leidenschaftlich's Soldier Maiden.\" Gallery. &lt;tabber&gt; Anime= Light Novel= &lt;\/tabber&gt;"}
{"url":"https:\/\/violet-evergarden.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2046","text":"Violet Evergarden's Relationships Throughout her life, initially as a mass-murdering soldier and later as one of the most famous Dolls in the amanuenses industry, Violet Evergarden has formed many relationships. Despite her expressionless and aloof personality, she is considerate and empathetic, always striving to help her clients no matter what. The impressions from those who have met her are many; some say her voice is pleasant, some would say her handwriting is pretty, some praise her charms by claiming they had been bewitched by her, and some would say their hearts were saved by her. Her clients note that she has a special power of saving people and reshaping their lives. Gilbert Bougainvillea. Violet's strongest relationship is undoubtedly with Gilbert. He was Violet's major in the army; he was the only person who saw her as a normal human being rather than a tool. She became very attached to him due to him being the first person to show her kindness and compassion. During their first meeting, Gilbert immediately embraced her, such a thing being done to Violet for the first time in her life. Due to that, she felt like she couldn't listen to orders from anyone except for Gilbert, him being the person Violet thought to herself to follow. Violet is extremely loyal to Gilbert, and he also became a source of strength for her, as she claimed that she would be able to do anything if she had Gilbert's orders, to which Hodgins claims that she is obsessed receiving orders from him. Violet vowed to be useful since she was his tool and since he needed her. Despite Gilbert is fearing her ability to kill at first, Gilbert came to genuinely care for her deeply, and Violet developed a deep respect for him since he kept her by his side; in Violet's world, he was and still is the world to her. She cares for him to the point where she prioritizes his health over her own, to which she is very devoted to him, lives to protect him and will turn violent if he is attacked. When she becomes injured, she does not care about her own injuries, but only about his well-being. Violet learned speech, writing and different emotions from Gilbert and the two grew very close during the four years they lived with each other. After the war, Violet thought it would appropriate to throw her away since she had lost her arms and couldn't be \"useful\" to Gilbert anymore, and she was very lonely without him as she wrote letters to him and constantly tried to find him. She misses him dearly and Violet states that there is not a single day that goes by with her not thinking about him. Despite being absent for a long time, Gilbert plays a huge role for Violet, as she associates many feelings and memories with him. She often thinks back to him when she is feeling insecure or lonely, and he indirectly gives her mental support. Gilbert's influence has also stayed with Violet the whole time, and he is very precious and dear to Violet, which is why she is very determined to learn the meaning behind Gilbert's \"I love you\", in doing so, she comes to do many things she hadn't prior. However, Violet became utterly depressed and was in shock, frustration, and sorrow upon learning that Gilbert has supposedly died. She had a really hard time accepting his death and neglected her work for a while since she refused to believe Gilbert's fate. But with the help of her friends and co-workers, Violet slowly began to recover and come to terms with it. Violet also states that she will freely live, leaving her life in the war as a soldier and a weapon behind since that is was what Gilbert had so deeply wished for. Even though Violet denies being in love with Gilbert since she doesn't understand love, Violet knows that she wants to be by his side forever, and it is evident that she is in love with him due to her actions. Several people Violet has met has drawn the conclusion that Violet is in love with Gilbert due to her great devotion, care and love towards him. It is more obvious though that Violet loves Gilbert as family, since he was the only support system she ever knew, along with being her caretaker. After their reunion, Gilbert still very much loves Violet, and she, as well, has come to understand the concept \"love\" and her feelings towards him slightly better. However, Gilbert decides to wait for Violet until she truly understands the words \"I love you\", and he wants her to, when that time comes, for her to accept his love. CH Postal Company. Claudia Hodgins. Violet has a deep respect for Hodgins due to the reason him being a former Lt. Colonel in the army and her boss at the CH Postal Company. At Gilbert's request, Hodgins began watching over Violet after the war and was also the one who picked her up from the hospital and gave her the work at the CH Postal Company. Hodgins claims that she is still useful and could work as a regular human being with Violet thinking otherwise. Violet is grateful for this and asks to work as a Doll. When she starts working at the CH Postal Company, Hodgins supported her despite her frequent mistakes in the beginning and didn't want to fire her when Hodgins was advised to do so by others. With Hodgins' guidance, Violet eventually developed into a very talented Doll. It is also indirectly because of Hodgins' words that Violet learned that she had many burn marks from her past, which, among numerous other reasons, made her very upset. However, Hodgins ensures her that it is okay for her to live on and that although what she had done in the war can never be undone, it also applies to all of the good deeds she has done as a Doll. Thanks to Hodgins and her friends' support, Violet was able to slowly move on. Lux Sibyl. Violet met Lux in Utopia on the isolated island of Chevalier. Together, they went through an ordeal of surviving being a sacrifice of a religious cult, which was the starting point for their friendship. Violet was the one who made Lux realize that she was being trapped at Utopia, and encouraged her to leave the place when she didn't have the courage to do so. When Lux desired to die at Utopia due to her fear of the outside world, Violet came to save her. Violet relates to Lux's situation and claims that she is the same as her, as Violet too had not known of the world outside of her own world, the military. But just like Violet had been chosen to live her life, she encouraged Lux to do the same in order to experience new things in the world like she hadn't prior. Violet then took Lux to the CH Postal Company so she could start working there, and after that, they develop a close friendship, to which they began talking with each other without honorifics. Lux becomes Violet's first tea friend, and although Violet is a highly-requested Doll, Lux would invite her for tea when Violet had time. During those times, they would report their recent situations and different journeys they had been through to one another. Lux says that she is forever indebted to Violet for saving her, and says that Violet is the friend she was proud of having. CH Postal Company Clients. Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel. Violet became friends with Princess Charlotte after she was assigned as her personal Doll. In the beginning, Violet's expressionless personality got on Charlotte's nerves, but she eventually warmed up to her. Violet genuinely cares about Charlotte, as she expressed her desire to stop Charlotte's sorrow and tears as in her anxiety about marrying Prince Damian. She wanted to help Charlotte as Violet Evergarden, not as her Doll. Violet then takes full responsibility in with talking with Damian's Doll and arranges to have Charlotte and Damian write their own letters to each other since the CH Postal Company wouldn't stand for any of that. Violet then stays by Charlotte's side and helps her with her letters. Although Violet couldn't attend Charlotte's wedding, she is seen to have given a bright, genuine smile for the first time on screen, due to being content and happy with Charlotte's happiness as in her love coming true. Leon Stephanotis. Violet was partnered with Leon when scholars and Auto Memories Dolls are paired for a collection of research pieces at the Shaher Astronomical Headquarters. Although Leon treats her coldly in the beginning, Violet doesn't really mind. Since they finished a three-days worth work in one day, Violet remarked about Leon being amazing, and Leon is also impressed with how quickly she works. When other scholars remarked about Leon's rude attitude and how he was abandoned by his parents, Violet stood up for him by saying that she is an orphan too and had not even seen her parents' faces. Although Violet claimed she was only stating the facts, she said that she had also defended Leon since he is being her partner. Because of how similar they are, it makes it easy for them to sympathize with each other, and Violet notes that the two of them are alike. Leon then starts to develop feelings for Violet (his feelings are implied in the anime). Before Violet's departure, Leon musters up his courage and confesses his love for Violet. However, Violet couldn't accept his confession since she didn't feel like she wanted to be with him in that way, and since she already had someone else very dear to her. However, Violet is genuinely happy by his confession, and she is grateful towards Leon for showing her the stars and comet, in which she felt like she was \"having fun\". She also had a sensation that Leon treated her as a normal girl, which Violet appreciated. Even though she doesn't like him, she still felt like if they would ever meet again, she'd like to spend time with him like that again. Leon is content with this, and he then tells Violet that he will expedite around the world like her and that he would like to watch the stars with her again if they would ever meet again. Violet gives him her word and is happy for Leon for finding his new aspirations. When they meet again, Leon is aware that he is still in love with Violet and that his feelings towards her would not budge, but he decides to put that fact aside and ask her to watch the stars with him instead. Violet agrees, and as she had promised, she memorized the name of a few stars for Leon's sake. Oscar Webster. Oscar hired Violet to help him write a children's play starring a character based on his daughter. Although Violet was blunt with him and considered him to be troublesome, she helped him in every way she could, from making meals for him to helping him visualize a scene based on a wish of his daughter's. Violet is saddened by how Oscar lost his daughter and empathizes with Oscar's sadness from losing the people dear to him. After seeing Olivia's wish realized through Violet, Oscar began to come to terms with the loss of his daughter, to which Oscar is deeply grateful for towards Violet. Anne Magnolia. Violet met Anne when her terminally ill mother, Clara requested her to write fifty letters to Anne for the future. Anne was distrustful towards Violet, but Violet never lost her composure during the whole week and treated Anne bluntly, yet with respect and kindness, calling her \"young mistress\". When Anne became interested and ultimately very attached to her, asking to play with her all the time, Violet remained calm and although she was challenging to stick with, Violet did not neglect her in any way and gave her the attention she needed, since Violet knew Anne was lonely due to Violet spending a lot of time with her mother, working. Violet understood Anne's desire to spend time with her mother, which is why Violet would tell Anne she would leave soon when they were done. When Anne had a sad and angry outburst, Violet comforted Anne by embracing her, telling her that she was free to cry. She managed to calm Anne down and convince her to not blame herself for her mother's illness. Violet then confessed that she thought that Anne is a very gentle, respectable, and strong girl to accept her mother\u2019s disease, as Violet claims that children her age would usually not complain or care for someone to the extent Anne did. This event would leave a huge impact on Anne as she grew up, as she claims she would never forget Violet who had embraced her when she was young. When Violet returned back to the post office, she is overcome with emotion at the thought of Anne is having to live alone after her mother's death, and admits that she held back her tears the whole time she was at the Magnolia residence. Aidan Field. Aidan entrusted Violet to write the letters for his loved ones before his death, due to being a soldier in a civil war in Ctrigall. Even though Hodgins refused the request due to the danger, Violet went there to convey her client's feeling. Violet did everything she could to find and rescue Aidan, from arriving by parachute, defeating his enemies and taking him to a safe cabinet where he believed he was mortally wounded. Violet was beside Aidan the whole time and promised him that she would convey his feelings to his parents and lover to matter what. During his last moments, to ease Aidan's loneliness and give him some sense of warmth before his death, Violet held his hand and kissed his forehead. When Violet delivered the letters to Aidan's loved ones, she broke down in tears, apologizing for being unable to protect Aidan. Even after Aidan's death, she blames herself for his death, but respects him a lot. This is why she was seen being enraged at Aidan's former enemies who mocked him for dying, to which she attempted to gravely wound them. Friends and other Acquaintances. Luculia Marlborough. Violet met Luculia at the Auto Memories Doll Training School. Like everyone else, Luculia thought that Violet stood out from the crowd as she was a bit eccentric, but she didn't think much about it and later started a conversation with Violet. They also practiced their ghostwriting skills on each other, and after that, they developed a friendship to the point where they don't use honorifics with each other. When things didn't go as planned for Violet at training, Luculia tried to cheer her up by taking her to her favorite spot. Since Luculia had done so much for her, Violet also came to care for Luculia, and it is also thanks to her that Violet learned the emotion \"gratitude.\" Since Luculia had always wanted to thank her brother for coming home for the war but couldn't find the words to say so, Violet managed to write a short and concise letter that effectively conveys Luculia's feelings to her brother, to which the latter is really grateful for. Luculia is also very happy that Violet was able to become a Doll and hugged her out of joy, and she claims that Violet also taught her the most important aspect of being a Doll. It is evident that Violet doesn't want Luculia to worry, as when she was concerned about how Violet was feeling, she gave her a smile as to not make her worry. Just like Luculia has been happy for Violet's achievements, Violet, as well, has been supportive of Luculia and will praise her achievements and good deeds. Dietfried Bougainvillea. Dietfried was the first person Violet met as long as she can remember, and the first person whose orders Violet followed. Even though Dietfried made her into a weapon and even claimed to have punched and kicked her, Violet respects Dietfried. On the other hand, Dietfried hates Violet so much that he cannot bear it, and is disgusted by the fact that she is now a Doll who writes letters who brings people together, since she had murdered so many people, including his men. It is due to his words that Violet's self-confidence starts to shrink, and she even begins to question her own living. However, whenever Dietfried makes a statement that she is only a weapon who follows orders, Violet denies this every time. She also denied to kill herself when she was ordered to do so by Dietfried since she was told to live. Although Dietfried harbors a strong resentment towards Violet, she claims that she doesn't hate him and will even try to help him if he needs it. Dietfried doesn't want Violet's sympathy though, but he does come to accept her as a Doll and as \"Violet Evergarden\", not a tool. He also tells her to swallow all of her past crimes down and live life to the fullest, and not to blame her sins on anyone. And when she is done, he tells her to die. Violet describes these words as \"encouragement\"."}

Summary. Ann Magnolia is a seven year old girl who lives with her ailing mother in a large mansion. One day, Ann sees Violet Evergarden walking up to the mansion and tells her mother about it. Her mother, delighted at the news, decides to dress up for her guest. Ann is bothered by her mother's enthusiasm as she knows that her mother doesn't have long to live and wants to keep her all to herself until the end. Violet is here for one week to write letters for Ann's mother, who refuses to tell Ann who they are addressed to. Ann assumes that the letters are for her absent father, who walked out on them after losing money in business and only occasionally came back to get things from the mansion to sell. Ann isn't allowed to be with her mother and Violet as they write the letters in the garden and can only watch them from the parlor. Ann decides to carry food to Violet, who always insists on eating alone. Ann catches a glimpse of a gun in Violet's bag. Violet explains that she carries one with her because her next destination is a battlefield. Ann leaves Violet's room to go to bed, but turns around before leaving and sees Violet pressing the gun's sight against her forehead and asking for someone to give her orders. Ann found herself feeling drawn to Violet and curious about her. Ann starts asking Violet to play with her, which Violet obliges every time. A few days into Violet's stay at the house, Ann's mother suddenly collapses during a letter writing session. Ann tearfully begs her mother to stop writing the letters, but she refuses. Ann yells at her mother for caring more about the letters than her, and for lying about getting better. Upon realizing that she made her mother cry, Ann is taken out of the room by Violet. Ann cries as Violet comforts her, telling her that she is a good and kind girl for always taking care of her mother without ever complaining, and that her mother's illness is no one's fault. Ann asks Violet about the receiver of the letters, but Violet won't tell her. When Ann says that the letters don't have to be sent, Violet tells her that there is no letter that didn't need to be sent. After a few more days, Violet leaves for her next job. A few months later, Ann's mother passes away. On her eighth birthday, Ann receives a letter from her mother. She learns from the mailman that her mother signed a long-term contract to have letters delivered to her on her birthday every year. The letters continue to come as Ann grows up, works as a lawyer, falls in love with a young entrepreneur and has her own daughter. Ann wants to do the same thing for her own daughter, and to see Violet once more in order to thank her. "}

Summary. The chapter begins with a short definition of Auto Memories Dolls, which were machines created by Dr. Orland for his blind wife Molly, to help her write. The machines are now widely manufactured and can be rented out. Oscar is a scriptwriter who lives alone in a small house on the outskirts of Roswell. He once had a wife and daughter, but they both died from the same illness one after the other. Oscar lived a reclusive life in mourning for years afterward until a friend approached him to ask him to write a new play. However, because of his previous alcoholism, his hands shake whenever he writes, so his friend offered to hire an Auto Memories Doll for him to help him with writing. A few days later, the Auto Memories Doll Violet Evergarden arrives. She is on loan to him for two weeks. Under the impression that she is a mechanical doll, Oscar is impressed by her speed in typing and her pleasant reading voice. The two work efficiently for a few days until Oscar gets writer's block for a certain scene. During these few days living with Violet, Oscar realizes that he has been living a lonely life for all this time. After three days, Oscar finally gets a breakthrough on the scene he is stuck on. He asks Violet to model the play's heroine by dressing up in a costume and walking by the lake. In the play, the heroine fulfills her promise to her elderly father of walking on the fallen leaves floating on the lake. Hearing that, Violet decides to act out that scene in reality by running at a rapid speed and using the parasol Oscar bought for her. Oscar breaks down into tears as he watches her, thinking about how his daughter might have grown up to look like Violet and recalling how she had made a similar promise to him mere hours before she died. He is faced with the fact that he alone must live on. Afterwards, Violet takes a bath to clean up from getting soaked in the lake. Oscar, still unused to having to knock before he enters, walks in on her bath and finally realizes that Violet is human. Later, Oscar learns from his friend that Violet is actually famous within the Auto Memories Doll world. His friend gifts him a mechanical typing doll, but Oscar feels that it's no match for Violet.

Summary. A young Violet learns about snow from her master. He tells her that snows makes color and sound disappear. When she asks if it would make all of his worries disappear if snow covered the world, he tells her that making something disappear doesn't mean solving them. Violet goes to the Altair Detention Center to meet with her latest client. A staff member named Chaser takes her to meet with him. Chaser mentions that Violet is the basis for the protagonist for one of Oscar's latest plays. The two descend the depths of the prison until they reach the client's cell. Violet is asked to leave anything that can be used as a weapon with the guards. She gives them all the weapons hidden on her person and enters the cell. Inside, Violet meets its prisoner and her client, Edward Jones, the most securely guarded prisoner in Altair. He asks Violet to recite his criminal record, which she does, outlining his extensive list of crimes, including committing war crimes in the Continental War, assault, rape, arson, creating a cult and killing all the members and desecrating their bodies. Only thirty minutes were given to them by the guards, so Violet wants to get started right away, but Edward wants to continue chatting. He recognizes her from a joint mission between their countries back when they were soldiers and even knows that she had abandoned her past and become an Auto Memories Doll. As Violet continues asking him to write his letter, Edward suddenly starts banging his arms against the table and howling. He rants about how both of them had killed many people, but because his country lost, he was labeled as a war criminal. He rambles about how the members of his cult wanted to become a part of him, and so he asked them to prove it. He tells Violet that he is envious of her and talks about the things he wants to do to her. Violet wipes the blood from his hands with a handkerchief. When Edward remarks that it has been a long time since he had been touched by a girl, Violet responds that she is not what could be called a girl, but a murderer who is supposed to be in prison like him. She tells him that she hadn't forgotten about her deeds, and that she still carries weapons in her bag, which surprises him, as he assumed that she had thrown away her past. Edward asks her many questions, including what she thinks about killing and if she thought of herself as the same as other human beings. Violet has no desire to return to the battlefield, but will obey the person who ordered her to be in her current position if he told her to. She does not understand emotions and thinks that she probably likes hurting and killing people. She admits that she is a wicked person. Edward claims that he has fallen in love with her and is overjoyed that they are so similar. Violet once again asks him who he wants to write the letter to, and he reveals that he is on death row. He tells her that he wants to write the letter to the one person he can't kill, God. He whispered into her ear and told her what he wants her to write. Just then, the timer goes off, marking the end of their time together. Violet leaves the prison with Chaser. Just before Violet sets off in the carriage, Chaser asks her who she will mail that letter to, but Violet refuses to say. Chaser reveals that she has been listening to their conversation the whole time and asks her to throw away the letter, but Violet refuses and says that the God she and Edward will meet one day is different from the one Chaser will meet. Chaser says that she will tell God that Violet cared for her when she meets him in the future, and Violet thanks her. The carriage leaves, and Chaser shouts that she will ask Violet to write her a letter one day. Inside the carriage, Violet asks the major to give her an order."}
{"url":"https:\/\/violet-evergarden.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3186","text":"Violet Evergarden Volume 1\/The Scholar and the Auto Memories Doll is the fourth chapter of \"Violet Evergarden Volume 1\". Summary. The Shaher Astronomical Headquarters has hired a large number of Auto Memories Dolls to assist them with transcribing astronomy texts for a month. All the young men who work at the institution are excited for their arrival with the exception of Leon Stephanotis, a young astronomer who dislikes women and romance. The administrator of the codex department, Le Verrier, pairs him up with Violet Evergarden, who is actually filling in for Cattleya Baudelaire, a colleague of hers from the C.H Postal Company. Leon is struck by her beauty and feels the first stirrings of love. Though Leon himself doesn't know the feelings he's experiencing, the other scholars tease him for falling in love for the first time. Leon and Violet work at a fast and efficient pace, outdoing all the other pairs. When Leon questions Violet about why she isn't tired, she tells him that it is far more tiring to travel to different locations, including battlefields. Leon realizes his view of Auto Memories Dolls as simple social climbers was wrong. Leon asks her why she would do such a difficult job. Violet replies that she doesn't find it difficult at all, because she finds the work of putting her clients' feelings to paper, or even copying sentences from ancient texts, to be wonderful. Leon finds himself relating to that feeling. Violet becomes popular among the scholars for her beauty and coolness, and many of them also become jealous of Leon. One day, while Leon is getting books from the library, he overhears three other scholars corner Violet and attempt to convince her to change partners by disparaging Leon's personality and revealing his status as an orphan who relied on the observatory's kindness to survive. However, Violet defends Leon by revealing her own past as an orphan who only learned how to read and write recently. She tells the scholars that just like Leon, she didn't grow up in respectable circumstances, and in fact came from a lowlier position than him. She finishes by telling them that Leon is her master, so she will defend him if they tried to hurt him. The scholars hastily retreat. When Leon meets up with her again, she asks if she can borrow some books from the library as well. She remarks that they are somewhat similar, since they both have faces that cause people to mistake their emotions. Three days have passed since the Auto Memories Dolls first arrived. Leon's roommate suggests that he invites Violet to observe Alley's Comet, a comet that can only be seen every two hundred years, with him. Violet will be leaving in four days, which is also when the comet will be arriving. Leon finds her eating outside by herself at lunch. She explains that this is a habit from her military days. Leon works up the courage to invite her to go view Alley's Comet with him, and she accepts. On the day of the comet, Leon and Violet go into the mountains to view it. Violet remarks about Leon's kindness in bringing so many things to keep her comfortable during the cold night. Leon admits that he isn't kind and that he hates women, or rather, he avoids women because associating with them always ended up badly for him. He tells her about his parents. His mother was a wanderer who fell in love with his father in this city. His father worked for the documents collection department of the Shaher Astronomical Headquarters and was rarely home. One day, he didn't come back from one of his trips, and Leon's mother decided to leave her son behind to search for him. Leon hated her for choosing romance and love over being a parent to him, but he still waits for her return. He was taken in by Shaher after they learned of the disappearances of his parents, but he still holds a grudge against his mother to this day. After listening to Leon's story, Violet guesses that his mother was very important to him. She tells him that she doesn't have any blood relatives, but that she had someone who took care of her when she was a child. When Leon asks her if she feels lonely without them, she admits that she doesn't understand emotions very well. Leon then questions her about her feelings, and she states that that person was like the world to her, and that if they were in trouble, she would drop everything to go help them. Just as Leon was caught off guard by the depth of her feelings, the comet appears. The next day, Leon goes to see Violet off at the lift. He finds himself feeling empty at the thought of not being able to see her anymore. He gets the courage to tell her that he loves her. Violet responds by telling him that when she saw the comet and stars with him last night, she felt what it truly meant to have fun. She tells him that she doesn't know what love is, so she can't return his feelings like a normal girl, but if they ever meet again, she would like to spend time with him together. She apologizes, but Leon tells her that there is nothing to apologize for. He confesses that he actually wants to join the documents collection department like his father and travel the world like Violet. He had stayed at Shaher for all these years, hoping that his parents would return one day, but after he met her, he no longer wanted to just wait. He asks her if they ever meet again, they would look at the stars together once more. Violet agrees. Just before the lift leaves, Violet tells him the name of her company and to call her name if he saw her again one day, and until then, she would try to learn the names of a few stars. In the distant future, Leon and Violet meet each other once again under the night sky in the desert. When Leon asks if she has learned the name of a few stars, she nods happily. As promised, the two spend time together looking at the stars. "}

At Aidan's hometown, Violet gives the news to his heartbroken parents and Maria. Aidan's mother thanks her for bringing back her son, which surprises Violet, who is now unable to hold back her tears.
