{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5788","text":"Sky-Faring Commission The Sky-Faring Commission is one of six commissions of the Xianzhou Alliance. Overview. The Sky-Faring Commission is in charge of affairs related to Xianzhou's internal airspace and interstellar navigation. All matters related to flight are the domains of the Sky-Faring Commission. Starskiff maintenance also falls within their jurisdiction. On the Xianzhou, anything relating to aviation, navigation, and trade falls under the jurisdiction of the Sky-Faring Commission. On the Luofu, it is headquartered in the Palace of Astrum under the oversight of Helm Master Madame Yukong, who leads the commission. Numerous guilds under the Sky-Faring Commission's administration conduct trade and bring in business for the Luofu. Starskiff Haven, the official entrance of Luofu and its largest port, is also governed by the Sky-Faring Commission. History. In the Year 5700 Star Calendar, Lord Ravager and Overlord Celenova boards a Xianzhou Ship and requests a ceasefire with the Xianzhou Zhuming, requesting the ship to change course and assist in attacking the homeworld of the wingweavers. Yueyan, the Foxian Helm Master of the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus' first master primus, left his position after witnessing the Antimatter Legion's destruction of Muldrasil as the Alliance stood by, Yueyan's belief was shaken and he decided to re-think the long-life species' duty and purpose in life, driving a starskiff to roam the stellar seas in search of an answer. Once, a delegation containing Baiheng and a dozen others were sent to request for arms and reinforcements from the Xianzhou Zhuming for the Yaoqing's Crane Feather Orbit Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the Borisin. They were recieved by General Huaiyan's apprentice, Yingxing, at Radiant Zenith and escorted through by the Flamedisk Forge Palace, where they observed the Flint Emperor's light being sealed. There, they met with Huaiyan, who was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Helm-Master Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel. On the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of Ketu Mirage; the roaming star and their attack on the Xianzhou Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight but they were still facing defeat. Fu Xuan and Jing Yuan, Diviner and Arbiter-General of the Luofu, came up with a plan to contact the Reignbow Arbiter using the Xianzhou Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope on a Navis Astriger. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, During the course of the battle, the Xianzhou Luofu lost over 63,000 fighter jets and over 120,000 pilots, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves are destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. As for the overall casualties of the Xianzhou Alliance; among the nearly million pilots that participated in the air battle, not more than 100,000 survived. Ever since the Third Abundance War, the Fanghu had adopted self-preservation policies to recuperate and even stopped issuing new travel passes briefly due to the damage inflicted. As a result, they had cut off most of their regular communications and trade with the other Xianzhou ships, a decision from the Fanghu's high elder, Glaciator Marum, implicitly stemming from the Vidyadhara's inability to produce offspring. After the new travel policy was put into place, the ship opened up to visitors once more. On April, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Fanghu announced on the Yellowbell system that they were currently moored at the Lanadi star system in the Tlaltecuhtli star cluster, a system with no terrestrial planets, except for one with a rudimentary ecosystem. The Fanghu had determined this to be a hidden star system with no ecosphere within several light years' range, meaning it could easily evade attacks from the Denizens of Abundance or the Antimatter Legion and is expected to moor there for some ten Star Calendar years, unless unforeseen circumstances were to transpire. On May of that year, the Yaoqing reported a resounding victory against Fallomom's abominations. On June of that year, they secured a resounding victory against Toste-VIII's abominations. On July of that year, the Yuque reported continuing their explorations along an ancient shipping lane. The Yuque's surveillance report was received by Xikui of the Luofu Sky-Faring Commission and submitted to Helm-Master Yukong. Sometime in the present, the Xianzhou Yuque was trekking around the periphery of the Giant's Arm star cluster, plotting an ancient course as it continued its explorations. The ship's Cloudpeer Telescope captured signals from Reignbow's Lux Arrow traversing through three of its coordinates. On October of that year, the Xianzhou Xuling reported \"Business as usual here\". Xikui remarked that she still had no idea where exactly the Xuling was. Yukong said that this was normal. On October that year, they reported a resounding victory against Sakin Chadu's abominations, though victory was uncertain until support from the Interastral Peace Corporation arrived. Helm-Master Yukong advised the Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission to take appropriate recuperation measures; in which on November of that year, the Yaoqing moored in the Sakin Chadu star system in Kersarran star cluster and cooperated with the Interastral Peace Corporation to harness local minerals and recuperate, ensuring that everyone was safe and sound, thanking Yukong for her concern. She responded by asking them to remain professional when chatting over the Yellowbell system. On November of that year, the Zhuming reported that it was moored in the Le Roy Ladurie cluster's Stella Yamazaki star system, inside the territory of the Klimt Republic and was set to remain there for 10 Star Calendar years to conduct scientific exchanges, hoping to deploy advanced forging technology in exchange for some of the rich local mineral deposits. On December of that year, the Yaoqing reported another resounding victory against Asmodeus' abominations. When asked by Xikui if they should send them any kind of message, Yukong told her to leave them be."}

Text. \"*This is an advertisement flyer from a diner that closed down.*\" The Legend of Snapper Jam Appetizer The Eternal Freeze was imminent and Belobog had not yet been formally established. Under the command of the first Supreme Guardian, Alisa Rand, workers were summoned from across the country for the largest insulation project ever in history. This enormous layer of insulation would prepare Belobog for the endless blizzard. At that time, a young worker by the name of Nicholas was good at cooking. Not only had he mastered all kinds of traditional dishes, but also had developed many new ones. Every weekend, workers would bring over food to his home, so that he could prepare a big meal for everyone. Every worker would leave his home satisfied with a full stomach. However, it wasn't long until they wanted to taste his delicious food during the work days. \"Is there any way to eat a delicious meal on a cold construction site?\" Food would quickly turn cold and hard due to the weather conditions on a construction site. It didn't taste as good as dishes fresh out of the pot. The heating technology at the time also wasn't as developed. The smart Nicholas believed this to be a major problem, one that almost all workers would encounter. Solving it meant that he could help everyone. Thus, he pondered: Is there any food that can endure the bitter cold? Nicholas spent countless hours trying different dishes at home. He tried various combinations, but none of the results satisfied him. One day, he was mentally exhausted and hadn't realized the fried fish was already cold. On top of that, he accidentally knocked the fried fish into the pot, cooking it together with redsunset jam. By the time he realized, it was already too late. He put the dish aside, ready to throw it out the next day. However, when he woke up the next day, he decided to give it a taste. To his surprise, it was delicious! He had come up with an ultimate cold dish, one that workers could eat in the cold weather. Thanks to Nicholas' promotion, Belobog workers can enjoy a delicious lunch, motivating them to work harder. The news spread to Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand, who tasted his unique dish and praised his innovation. She named the dish \"Snapper Jam Appetizer.\" Afterward, Nicholas made further improvements to the dish. It is now the most famous dish for Belobog gatherings. \"There are many scribbles on the page:\" What nonsense and fabrications. A novel? The Supreme Guardian's Secret Visit It was around 100 AF when they cultivated the redsunset fruit for jam that could withstand the cold. So that's more useless knowledge. Nice."}

The Snow Plains in Snowland are home to a variety of wildlife such as Snowrock lizards, torch-antler elk, Yaks, Wildboars and white bears. The hunters' rule for surviving the Snow Plains of Snowland was simple enough \u2014 Never go to the south of the mountain during Artaius' hunting season, since that white bear did not welcome anyone. As the name suggests, Springtime climate in Snowland is exceedingly rare. Snowland is home to organizations such as the Snowland Animal Welfare Association, Hunters Association and companies like Snowland Biopharmaceuticals Limited. The pharmaceutical branch of the IPC hunts biological materials to manufacture precious drugs, recruiting bounty hunters in the Snowland to procure them. The high-tech, streamlined suspended matrix is a type of trap believed to be used only by the most cutting-edge hunter on Snowland. History. Sometime in the past, a hunter sent by the association, Hugh, went to the south of the mountain in the Snow Plains after receiving the rescue call. Never did he expect to walk right into an ambush long in the planning. After waking up from a long shock induced by gunshots, Hugh immediately realized he just barely escaped death. However, he also realized his plight was far from over, for Artaius was staring right at him. Despite the short range and fast pace, some of Artaius' messy attacks were bound to miss. Hugh calmly waited for an opening, then he whipped out his bone blade soaked in poison and jumped up for an extraordinary strike in the blink of an eye. Their positions as the predator and the prey were reversed. After removing Artaius' head and fur, he managed to survive the first night in snow despite his untreated gunshot wounds. Days later, the Hunters Association located Artaius' headless corpse. It was then they realized the hunter who was supposed to die had survived, and an unforeseen avenger was born. Registered hunters decided to march into the snowy mountains to hunt down Hugh and neutralize the approaching threat. Though there were many exceptionally powerful talents among the register hunters of the association, they were never comrades who had each other's back. Hunters congregated only for the hefty prize of the bounty, and would betray one another without hesitation for the right price. To them, anything could happen on these desolate plains. As long as the old hunter Hugh was taken care of, everyone would earn more bounty. That was their consensus, for which they paid the price. Hugh made more than enough preparations. For him, hunting the top hunters would be no easier a task than hunting monsters. Hugh had to be more patient than ever, as he believed patience was always the most valued trait in a hunter. Before long, the number of registered hunters in the Hunters Association began to dwindle, for the rumored horror known as Hugh the Undead was spreading. The Lord of the Ice Lake, whose body was fully covered in unique scales that dazzlingly reflected the sunlight, could easily render itself invisible by diving underwater. Few hunters could handle a battle with such an invisible monstrosity. Days later, the registered hunters of the association stumbled upon the Ice Dragon's carcass with its scales already peeled off. At that moment, their horror surpassed their shock. The beasts that Hugh had hunted down numbered in the thousands, each and every one of which was uniquely precious. It was believed that only by reaching a thorough understanding of the prey's traits and habits would a hunter truly achieve the full completion of a hunt. For Hugh, the Lord of the Ice Lake was the last piece in the puzzle that was the Snow Plains. Hence, he had to finish the hunt, to bring his Hunter's Soul to completion. And then, the highest prized bounty was put on the head of Hugh the Hunter, instead of the Lord of the Ice Lake, marking the beginning of an all-out hunt. It is said that all hunters should be prepared to become the prey. It was so for Hugh, and even more so for those traitors. At some point, Hugh was ambushed by the registered hunters, fatally wounding him. He later hunted a torch-antler elk, managing to wound it. Despite being deeply wounded and too weak to maintain a body temperature that could melt snow, a dying torch-antler elk was still a most dangerous beast. He pointed his hunting rifle straight at the dying elk. Looking at the elk's eyes, he thought those reminded him of his own. Ever since the ambush, Hugh's life force had already become depleted. He was sharply aware that the only reason he managed to survive was due to his unyielding desire for revenge. He felt that should it become satiated, his life would instantly come to an end. Despite his heavy footsteps, Hugh's large soft elk-skin boots did not leave any prints on the ground. He had to stay sharp for the last hunt of his life. Amid panic and hysteria, the Hunters Association began to crumble. They began to purge traitors in haste, hoping it could grant them Hugh's mercy. Instead, it only led to their own self-destruction by mutual distrust. Hugh fell down for good on the Snowy Plains before he could get a taste of the pleasure of completing his revenge."}

This publication showcases the most popular SoulGlad flavors to give customers an in-depth understanding of the most popular beverage in the cosmos.

Nobody can resist the urge to slam it in one gulp once they see the golden liquid in the spiral bottle start to bubble. Inside the SoulGlad bottle is more than just a syrup-based beverage, but rather a belief: the optimistic spirit of Syrupism, sending dreams out to all corners of the universe.Note: Chill first for optimal taste! Ice SoulGladIf the freezer doesn't satisfy your pursuit of ice cold, just give the Ice SoulGlad a try. This recipe has blue mint essence from the Tavis star system. The refrigerating bottle cap keeps the temperature infinitesimally close to the freezing point \u2014 even if the planet you're living on scorches below a trinary star system, this SoulGlad could save you from the fire!Note: Before drinking, please carefully assess the ambient temperature of your environment and the tolerance of your digestive system.

Bottled using a mega-ton compressor and containers made of macromolecule alloys, just one small sip will send millions of fine soda bubbles reveling on your palate. Don't be afraid of the slight sting \u2014 boldly enjoy the pleasure of exploding supernovae on the tip of your tongue!Note: Before drinking, please loosen the bottle cap and let the soda deflate for five seconds. Otherwise, all consequences shall be borne by the drinker. Sweet Dreams SodaFans of SoulGlad are spread throughout the cosmos. We have specially developed a number of different flavors with regional characteristics out of consideration of consumers in other star systems. Sweet Dreams Soda has been specially designed for consumers in the Xianzhou Alliance, carefully selecting local ingredients such as the dream-speaker flower and the calming-valerian to create a mellow herbal aroma that strengthens the body, aids sleep, and calms the nerves.Note: To avoid purchasing counterfeit goods, please do not purchase Sweet Dreams Soda from Xianzhou Group Deals or any other unofficial channels. Epochal SoulGladYou won't find Epochal SoulGlad on any store shelf in the universe, but it's the most delicious beverage in the whole universe \u2014 and is what SoulGlad should have been.Back when Penacony still served as a prison facility, SoulGlad's founder, Mr. Sousa, visited \u2014 only to discover a mysterious dreamleaf from which he concocted an extremely delicious sweet beverage. He spent the rest of his life trying to perfect it, finally creating the most perfect drink in the universe: Epochal SoulGlad! Unfortunately, as dreamleaf became extinct, this sumptuous flavor was eradicated from the world...Note: Thanks to the undying efforts of SoulGlad company's research, dreamleaf has now returned from extinction to the Dreamscape. This once-lost delicacy has survived to see the light of day once more! If you'd like to try this legendary flavor, please come to Penacony and experience it for yourself!"}

According to SoulGlad Enterprise's statements, Mr. Sousa invented SoulGlad while in prison to sweeten the bitter pain of prisoners.

According to \"Clockie: Dreamjoy Memoir\", the Astral Express Crew in debt took on the IPC's assignment to investigate riots in the Frontier Prison later known as Penacony. When the Crew arrived in the Frontier Prison, they met Mr. Sousa selling his Authentic Sousa Juice. The Crew was attacked by Hanunue, but Mr. Sousa was a friend of Hanunue and sought to resolve the conflict between Hanunue and the Crew. With Hanunue's permission, Mr. Sousa told the real story of the Frontier Prison to the Crew: the prisoners here suffered IPC's forced cruel labor all year round, and it wasn't until a Stellaron fell that Hanunue started leading everyone to rise up. Only after hearing this story did the Crew join Hanunue's rebel. According to Aideen the current owner of SoulGlad, Mr. Sousa was not proficient in combat but stood together with the prisoners and heroically gave his life in the final battle \u2014 to realize his wish for peace."}

What appears to be THEIR body is a swirling nebula of magenta and blue stars enveloped by a large purple gas. Abilities. Shadows of IX. Shadows of IX or Shadows of Nihility are undefined creations of IX that exist in many forms. Its most prominent trait is the creation of Self-Annihilators, beings who have entered the Shadow of IX and from that moment have lost the meaning of their existence. Shadows of IX can appear in numerous forms, such as the \"Black Great Sun\" which threatened to destroy Izumo and Takamagahara before Acheron destroyed both planets. Another Shadow of IX appeared in a Memory Bubble sealed away by a faceless woman in a Memory Zone. This was later broken open by a Self-Annihilator and eventually destroyed by a group of Arbitrators. The Self-Annihilators' connections to Shadows of IX goes deeper than just a form of transformation. As theorized by Dr. Primitive, as Self-Annihilators aimlessly traverse the cosmos, they are also casting the shadow of the Aeon around the universe. As for the few who can single-handedly withstand the encroachment of Nihility on their existences, their journey of self-annihilation is drawn out to infinity, and the road they walk is like a shadow of IX cast in the world.

Related Entry \u2014 The Nihility ...I recall a story about the Nihility \u2014 Some people had once tried to assassinate IX. Those were the Annihilation Gang, trash who were too scared to join the Legion but still wanted to wreak havoc with Nanook. They had a mad idea about wanting to be the first humans to kill an Aeon. They thought IX might be easy to handle because the Aeon is peaceful and thinks there is no purpose to the universe, Paths, and life. Apparently, with the assistance of another Aeon, they really did launch their plan to assassinate IX. As expected, nobody heard from this gang ever again. This story is pretty much pointless except for this: The Aeon that helped the Annihilation Gang was Aha the Elation. Aha thought these people had a fun idea, so THEY lent these humans THEIR power for a while. Seriously, I can't get elated from any stories related to Aha..."}

Text. \"* This is an interview published on the\" Crystal Daily \u2014 Weekend Edition \"before the Solwarm Festival. *\" Among the Crystal Peaks: Do You Really Know About Ice Storms? Last week, the Belobog Meteorological Center issued a code orange ice storm warning. North Nycatha was buffeted by an intense cold front, as the center and suburbs of the Overworld were violently hit by ice storms. This time, the short bout of freezing rain brought glaze to Belobog. This is where long icicles form on many structures and trees. Thanks to the Architects' sacred protection, Belobog remains warm all year long, but there are still rare occasions of freezing rain. We have invited a Belobog meteorologist, Professor Yegard, to give us a brief introduction on ice storms. Reporter Millie (hereinafter referred to as M): Hello, Professor Yegard. Professor Yegard (hereinafter referred to as Y): Hello. M: Last week, Belobog experienced an ice storm in the suburbs and downtown area. Can you give a brief explanation of the causes? Y: At the weather station, we usually call it freezing rain. They refer to the same weather condition. Before we talk about that, I must first mention the abnormally low temperatures that occur in Belobog before the Solwarm Festival. M: I believe you're referring to the Belobog Winter, right? The news has made announcements about it in every region. Y: The dropping temperatures combined with the sudden strong winds from outside the Belobog greenhouse area, which rushed to the suburbs, formed freezing rain. The urban heat island lied in the city center, so the temperature there was higher, causing rain to form. M: It's more like sleet where I live. What makes freezing rain special is the glaze. How is glaze formed? Y: It is formed when warm and cold air collides. Below the surface, the air and ground temperatures drop below freezing. Above the surface, it is relatively wet and temperatures are above freezing. As water transitions to the surface below, it forms supercooled water drops. M: So supercooled water drops are water droplets below the freezing point? Y: Yes, since the temperature near the ground is lower, the supercooled water drops form a thin layer of crystal clear ice when they touch buildings, trees, vegetation, or roads. These glaze formations on trees are what people usually call \"icicles.\" M: So that's how it is. Based on your description just now, is freezing rain a rare occurrence? Y: That's right. There's only a short time before and after the Solwarm Festival in which this natural phenomenon can occur. Citizens are free to enjoy this beautiful glaze scenery in the suburbs, with proper attire and safety conditions of course. M: Thank you, Professor Yegard, for taking the time to teach us about freezing rain. Y: You're welcome."}

History. After the Vidyadhara joined the Xianzhou Alliance, the entire delve of Scalegorge Waterscape on the Luofu was said to have been brought over from their home world, including the waters of the Lunarescent Depths. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\". The five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, High Elder of the Luofu at the time, made a decision to move the entire delve of Scalegorge Waterscape underwater to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor. The Xianzhou natives felt they owed the Vidyadhara a great debt for this, while some Vidyadhara, including Imbibitor Lunae, saw it as repayment for giving them a home on the Luofu. Dan Feng, the most recent Imbibitor Lunae, joined the High-Cloud Quintet and together they accomplished many feats: drove out the Borisin invading Thalassa, destroyed the alliance between the Houyhnhnms and Wingweavers in the Abundance Axis, rescued the Xianzhou Yuque and defeated the living planet Ketu Mirage, becoming one of the most prolific Vidyadhara of his time. Approximately a hundred years later though, the High-Cloud Quintet would fall apart and sometime after in the Year 7379 Star Calendar, Dan Feng would go on to commit a great crime. This would spark turmoil and be considered an act of rebellion against the Xianzhou Luofu and the event would be known as the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, a stain on Vidyadhara history. Upset by the endless cycle of death that war brought about, he used the Transmutation Arcanum to resurrect Baiheng who sacrificed herself in a great battle against Shuhu, while also allowing other races to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara species in order to solve the Vidyadhara reproduction problem. However, his tampering ended up creating an uncontrolled draconic abomination that wrought great destruction to the Scalegorge Waterscape and the creation of Bailu. The Luofu Vidyadhara were divided on the matter, there were those who sided with Dan Feng and those who sided with the Xianzhou. It was a controversial time of great unrest. With the Transmutation Arcanum in his possession, Dan Feng was able to personally perform the ritual to name a new High Elder of the Luofu, and he selected the Vidyadhara who would be reborn as Bailu. However the ritual failed, and as a result Dan Feng's power was splintered between Bailu and his next reincarnation, Dan Heng. Lady Bailu was selected to become the next Imbibitor Lunae, though she did not possess the same level of power as previous High Elders and the power of dragon transmutation was not passed on intact, as the Transmutation Arcanum had not been carried out in full, resulting in her gaining only a fraction her predecessor's power. In order to prevent a similar predicament, Yunyou, attendant to the young High Elder, Bailu, commissioned some of the finest craftsmen to create the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle the latter's tail in order to limit her powers. The Cloud Knights joined forces with the Vidyadhara Preceptors to assault him, Dan Feng was captured and his punishment was carried out; he went through torture and hatching rebirth and his subsequent incarnation was held in the Shackling Prison for a period of time before being exiled from the Luofu. After Dan Heng\u2019s exile, he traveled across the universe, still only a teen (presumably by Vidyadhara rather than mortal standards). Amidst Dan Heng's travels, he chanced on the Astral Express Crew, incidentally saving them by defeating huge monsters in the path of the Express. Himeko offered to take him in under the guise of being the train's guard and archivist. In Year 8100 Star Calendar, after a Stellaron was smuggled onto the Xianzhou Luofu, the Astral Express Crew eventually boarded the ship in order to resolve the Stellaron crisis and clear the Stellaron Hunters' name of any involvement. Despite Dan Heng's banishment from the ship, he decided to tail his companions out of concern for their well-being. Once aboard the Luofu, Dan Heng traveled with Sushang, a Cloud Knight transferee, and Luocha, a traveling merchant in the hopes of reuniting with his friends. When they reached the Alchemy Commission, Dan Heng slipped away from the others and boarded a starskiff to the Scalegorge Waterscape. There, he encountered Kafka and Blade, though his confrontation with the latter was interrupted by Yanqing. Blade proceeded to reveal Dan Heng's true identity as Imbibitor Lunae by stabbing him in the chest. When Yanqing tried to capture both of them, Blade and Dan Heng briefly fought side-by-side to defeat him. After the fight ended, Jing Yuan appeared and dismissed the Stellaron Hunters. He and Dan Heng continued deeper into the delve to meet up with the Astral Express Crew. Calling upon his powers from his previous incarnation, Dan Heng parted the waters of Scalegorge Waterscape to clear a path to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor. After removing the seals on the Arbor, the group confronted Lord Ravager Phantylia. Dan Heng and Jing Yuan managed to defeat her vessel by coordinating their attacks, with the powers of Dan Heng's Cloudhymn Roar and Jing Yuan's Lightning Lord, though Jing Yuan was injured in the battle and had to spend time away from his duties to recuperate. Due to Dan Heng's part in resolving the Stellaron crisis, Jing Yuan revoked his banishment decree, allowing him to come and go freely on the Luofu. Dan Heng later met with the Luofu's current High Elder, Bailu, and together they repaired the seal on the Ambrosial Arbor. Dan Heng met with Huanxi, one of Bailu's maids, who urged him not to meet her and instead meet with the Preceptor elders in order to take up the position of High Elder, claiming she did not want Bailu to take on the burden. Luying, a Vidyadhara alchemist from the Alchemy Commission, expressed a different sentiment to Dan Heng, fearing that he would threaten Bailu's position as High Elder, and asked him to leave the Luofu as they were making their way to the starskiff dock. At the Alchemy Commission, they came across General Jing Yuan, who was still recuperating. He gave them some advice before they left, where they were set upon by Vidyadhara assassins just as they met with Huanxi at the docks. After Dan Heng swiftly dispatched the assailants, they group made their way to Scalegorge Waterscape where they met Bailu and exchanged pleasantries. Both Dan Heng and Bailu expressed their disinterest in the High Elder position before proceeding down towards the Dragon Palace. There, Dan Heng tried repairing the seal but to no avail. Bailu, following his example, started to affect the seal. By working together and combining their powers, they successfully managed to strengthen the Arbor's seal, proving that Bailu did inherit some of Dan Feng's power through the Transmutation Arcanum. However, they were soon ambushed by more assassins concealed by cloudhymn magic. After they defeated the attackers, they discovered there were more concealed enemies looking for them. Dan Heng used mirage echolocation using the various mirage echoes lingering in the ruined Palace to detect and avoid the assassins. While conversing with the echoes, they learned more about the true nature of Dan Feng's crime. The group managed to reach the surface and met with Huanxi, who declared that she was worried about Bailu, as she had been attacked by assassins. After being questioned about how she knew about the assassins and how they were targeting Bailu, Huanxi revealed herself to be among their ranks and attacked the group with her fellow assassins. In the heat of battle, Jing Yuan joined the fight and assisted them in defeating the remaining assailants. Jing Yuan questions the Preceptors' motives, while Huanxi denied their involvement, insisting that she acted alone. She died before Jing Yuan could bring her in for further questioning. Dan Heng and Bailu reflected on what they learned, Dan Heng observing that while he had inherited Dan Feng's more combat-oriented and destructive abilities, Bailu inherited all of his healing and restorative abilities. Bailu posed that Dan Heng might have been the teacher that had always she needed, and that they might have been friends or disciples in their previous lives. Dan Heng revealed that his worries about Bailu had been assuaged by the Preceptors and that she always possessed true power. Regarding her healing abilities, Bailu assured Dan Heng that Dan Feng might have had a gentle side to him as well, before they both bid each other farewell."}

As the people of Insumousu became enlightened by civilization, they longer see the broken ship's deceased crew as fallen gods. However, their reverence remains unchanged. Insumousu's poets thus sing: \"The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore.\" In accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day \u2014 when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen \"gods\" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning \u2014 songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage. In the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu has been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day has quietly undergone more changes. Insumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis. As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, \"The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean.\" With the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration \u2014 People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system. Through their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. When the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart, Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague. The Xianzhou Alliance hopes that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, have given their response. At some point during the night of Divine Fall Day, the revelry would come to an abrupt halt. Adolescents, children, and Xianzhou residents would sit by the shore as adults emerge from the water and solemnly gaze at the oceanic horizon. Then, several starskiffs break through the water and fly from the bottom of the sea toward the star. The starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry. You can sail safely after my demise.\""}

Description. \"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\" Firstly, there was a shadow beyond the atmosphere, then a fiery glow as it entered the layers of air. At the end, its full form was revealed \u2014 It was a grand palace, a heavenly wonder beyond even the combined skill of all of Insumousu's greatest artisans. It descended slowly, as if it had condensed from the heavens themselves. Insumousu's ocean was vast, but could it truly contain this celestial palace fallen from the skies? No one knew for certain. \"Amidst the chaos, some dispersed and fled in all directions. Others remained in the villages on land and under the sea, anticipating the descent of the Divine Fall.\" The fallen Xianzhou Daiyu crashed onto the surface of Thalassa, leaving a deep watery crater in the heart of the Insumousu sea. For seven planetary days, the world trembled, while the magnificent ruins stood silently on the sea bed like the tragic and magnificent remains of a god. The survivors of Insumousu, living in their abodes in the sea bed, witnessed how their beloved homes were shattered by the celestial palace from beyond. Yet, with joy and elation, they soon found a new home in the remnants of the Daiyu after the Divine Fall. As living conditions improved, the people of Insumousu had more time and energy to think. They finally had the opportunity to ask the most important questions as they gazed upon the magnificent ruins that descended from the heavens: Who were \"they\"? And from whence did \"they\" come? In the days of old, the people of Insumousu knew not the art of metallurgy, nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. \"Legends\" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into \"myths\" over time. \"Myths\" then shaped cognition as they themselves endure the flow of time \u2014 until \"civilization\" was born. As centuries passed and stars shifted in the sky, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall. The well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words: \"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\""}

Eons passed in an instant and this logistical unit yet remains.

Currently led by the former Nameless Oswaldo Schneider, the Marketing Development Department is responsible for bringing worlds into the IPC's commercial sphere and spread the influence of Qlipoth the Preservation. Topaz described the members of the Department as skillful, but \"a tad bit zealous.\" Sarcastically dubbed as the \"Fanaticism Department\" by the Genius Society, the Geniuses also depicted a lottery distributor from the department in the Simulated Universe as someone willing offer bribes to secure Oswaldo's success in an election.

The current director, Yabuli, is also noted to have connections with the Council of Mundanites within the Guild that rouses intrigue, often welcoming waves of speculation.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=37129","text":"Interastral Peace Corporation\/History A timeline of historical events within or involving the Interastral Peace Corporation and it's many departments and staff. History. Founding. The Interastral Peace Corporation originated as a support team to assist Qlipoth in building their Celestial Comet Wall. They attempted to travel to different worlds to gather supplies as an offering to the Amber Lord. Since they only collected construction materials, however, the support team could only offer construction materials to trade. Almost 800 AE ago, Louis Fleming began trading for construction materials by offering other resources, such as fruit, for a certain marked-up price. This allowed the support team to realize that they needed to acquire and supply goods that are desirable to trade partners. And thus, Dongfang Qixing decided that, to be the only trade business in the cosmos, they must set their own rules. More than seven hundred and seventy Amber Eras ago, Louis Fleming and Dongfang Qixing announced the reformation of the support team and started the IPC. At the same moment, the IPC introduced the universal galactic currency: credits. They assigned a price tag to the specialties of every planet, which locals now purchased directly from the IPC using its credits. 700 years prior to the present events of the game, the organization had a small presence on Jarilo-VI. When the Antimatter Legion targeted the planet for invasion, the IPC fled, but not before giving an immense amount of funds for the Architects to build a wall surrounding Belobog and advanced automatons to use, giving them 280 years to repay the debt. The Architects ended up not using the provided automatons, as they did not know how to operate them and instead created replicas based on the blueprints left behind. In the end, the Supreme Guardian at the time, Alisa Rand, used the Stellaron to stop the Antimatter Legion via the Eternal Freeze. The payment was canceled 100 years after signing, as Jarilo-VI lost contact with the rest of the universe, making the IPC believe that the planet's civilization was destroyed. This new tide of the IPC allowed the organization to have a never-ending fund to stockpile resources for their Aeon. Though the organization now looks much different than their humble beginnings, they have never forgotten their sole pursuit of supporting Qlipoth. For over 800 AE, the IPC has accumulated construction materials across each planet surrounding the Aeon of Preservation. And yet, the Amber Lord has never paid the actions nor the resources of the IPC any heed. The IPC have many planets under their control and can annex new planets as they see fit for various reasons, such as collecting debts or attempting ecological reconstruction. Ecological reconstruction is not always successful; with their current technology, they have a 63% chance of reviving a planet, or 80% if Topaz is personally overseeing the project. Fairly Recent Activity. At some point, the IPC acquired Penacony and designated it as a prison planet. One of the IPC's executives, Oswaldo Schneider, would take control of the Marketing Development Department. On the planet Sigonia-IV, there had been an issue plaguing the corporation for multiple Amber Eras, which Oswaldo successfully resolved. However, the clans subsequently excluded the Avgins and Katicans due to their hostilities. The Katicans later plotted to kill the Avgins during the Kakava, an important Avgin festival. Despite Oswaldo's assurances that he would protect them, he failed to honor his agreement, leading to many Avgins being killed or labelled as missing; despite this stain, the operation was still considered a success. This led to Aventurine seemingly becoming the only Avgin remaining, though he would quickly move up to become one of the Ten Stonehearts. Oswaldo would later lead an operation on Aeragan-Epharshel. Facing both time constraints and resistance from the locals, he incentivized his crew with the promise of reward for the first person to acquire the resource, while also permitting the use of military force against the population to \"bring civilization to this world.\" The operation is implied to have killed many inhabitants in an \"unknown disaster,\" leaving only frail youth and elderly living in prohibitively small shelters. To this day, that black ore is still used in massive quantities as a rare metal to create devastating weaponry, and is shipped out to more and more planets on fleets of IPC transport ships. The Galaxy Ranger Boothill, a survivor of Aeragan-Epharshel, would later seek vengeance on Oswaldo for his crimes. Topaz's world, a small, obscure planet in the galaxy, produced heavy and chemical goods for other planets for trade. The massive amount of production resulted in its environment becoming contaminated with pollutants, and the people who were unable to leave resigned themselves to their fate. The IPC eventually came upon the world and restored the environment within a span of five years. Out of gratitude to the corporation, Topaz joined with a \"lifelong\" contract, soon working her way to the Ten Stonehearts. The IPC are also responsible for collecting taxes throughout the galaxy, with Topaz serving as the leader of the Special Debts Picket team to handle those with delinquent debts. They also have an antagonistic relationship with the Stellaron Hunters, posting large bounties on its members due to the threat they seemingly pose. Despite this, the Stellaron Hunters pay all of their dues on time, making them have an exceptionally good credit record. The IPC also posted a bounty on the Galaxy Ranger Boothill. Current Activity. At some point after the Stellaron was sealed and removed from Jarilo-VI, the IPC became aware that a civilization still existed on the planet and sent Topaz to collect the debt owed hundreds of years ago. Topaz also decided to annex the planet for the IPC, seeing similarities between it and her home world. Aventurine was against the idea, believing the planet to be a high-risk, low reward payout. Ultimately, after seeing the Engine of Creation and the peoples' resolve to rebuild themselves, Topaz has a change of heart and convinces the IPC to leave the world alone after some vouching from the Astral Express. The IPC relents, though as punishment, Topaz gets demoted and loses many of her bonuses. Topaz still left behind a group of IPC personnel on the planet. After Herta, Ruan Mei, Screwllum and Stephen Lloyd create the expansion, the IPC began to take an interest in their work, prompting them to create the expansion, taking place before The First Emperor's war. As the Borderstar Trade War also took place around that time period, Pearl entered an agreement with Herta to purchase any data related to the IPC from her. Following a Stellaron leak on Penacony, the IPC lost control of the planet. Eventually, The Family gave out formal invitations to many galactic factions, which also included the IPC, though this was a plan devised by The Watchmaker and Gallagher in order to find suitable people to seal the Stellaron. At this point, Diamond decides to handle the situation on the planet and their \"debt,\" assigning Aventurine to handle the issue, surprising him and Topaz as they both felt that Opal or Obsidian were better candidates. Aventurine concocts a plan to \"die\" in order to send him past Penacony's dreamscape in order to uncover the secrets hidden by the Family; while someone else had also seen the truth and lived, they could not reveal it. His plan relies on the Trailblazer to confront him; without their intervention, the plan would fail and be exposed. This prompts Topaz and Jade to begin \"harvesting\" upon seeing his cornerstone fade. Aventurine eventually returns from beyond the dreamscape with the assistance of a Knight of Beauty, after which Jade contacts and congratulates him for discovering the truth of Dreamflux Reef and that the recording that the Trailblazer gave him was now the most valuable chip in the game. However, he lost his cornerstone in the process, which had shattered to protect him from Nihility's taint in the Primordial Dreamscape. This was considered too high by Diamond, who had called Jade to discuss what they would do with him. Jade and Topaz would make their way to Pier Point for the \"final\" showdown in preparation to \"reap\" the rewards. After the call ended, Boothill burst into the room, demanding that he tell him where Oswaldo Schneider was. Aventurine later complained of having nightmares, resulting in the IPC hiring a Doctor of Chaos to treat him."}

Text. \"*This is a survey published in the\" Crystal Daily \u2014 Weekend Edition* The upcoming Solwarm Festival has everyone busy with festival preparations. My dear Belobog friends, have you made your suncakes? The reporter visited an ordinary household in Belobog. They talked about what preparations they had done and what the Solwarm Festival meant to them. The interviewee this time are a young member of the Silvermane Guards and his family. The interview was scheduled for the morning before the Solwarm Festival. The husband was preparing to go out and purchase food for the Solwarm Festival, while the wife stayed home to watch the child. Reporter: Hello, sorry to intrude. I'm Abel, the one who contacted you before. Ethan: Ah... no problem. It's my first interview so I'm a bit nervous. Reporter: Can you please introduce yourselves? Ethan: I'm Ethan and I'm a soldier. This is my wife, Hannah, and our child, little Beck. Hannah: Hello, I'm Hannah and I work at the library. Beck: ... Boock. Reporter: Beck is so cute. How old is he? Hannah: He just turned one. Beck: Ge... Tad. Reporter: It seems like he's trying to say something. Are you going out for groceries? Why are you bringing so many things with you? Ethan: Actually, I've asked for a leave of absence. My plan for today is to take some comfort foods to my good friends on the Frontline first, then head to the market. Beck: Ge Tad. Hannah: Shh... Reporter: Your friends must be happy. By the way, is little Beck talking already? Hannah: No no, he can only say a few simple words. Beck: Ge! Tad! Reporter: Hahaha, that's still very impressive for his age. What's he trying to say...? Hannah: Gepard the scoundrel. Ethan: I... don't agree with him. I always respect the Captain. Reporter: Well, I won't keep you. While you're out shopping, I'll interview your wife. Ethan: Wait... I'll go out later. Not sure what you will talk about during the interview. Ethan and Hannah have been married for more than two years. According to Solwarm Festival customs, the newlywed husband Ethan should bring ingredients and make suncakes with his mother-in-law. However, he has been on duty during the festival for two consecutive years due to the nature of his job. This year, Ethan can finally enjoy his Solwarm Festival holidays, which also gives him the opportunity to impress everyone with his cooking skills at his in-law's. Ethan: To be honest, I still don't know how to make it... Hannah: It's because you don't care. If the reporter didn't bring it up, you'd probably have forgotten it all. What would you have my mother eat? Ethan: Ah... Eh... Reporter: Please stop fighting. Little Beck just fell asleep. I see... Ethan doesn't usually cook, right? Ethan: Yeah, my wife usually cooks, since my job... Hannah: There you go again with your excuses. I'm busy with work too, but I make the time to cook. It all depends on whether you want to or not. Reporter: How about this? Why don't we learn how to make suncakes now? With an apron on and a kitchen knife in hand, Ethan looked every bit a pro despite it being his first time cooking. Even though it was his first time, Hannah, his wife, didn't seem too keen to help him in any way. She whispered to the reporter that she was going to use this opportunity to teach her husband a lesson. So, Ethan looked up the recipe for suncakes and followed it step-by-step. Add sugar and salt to three eggs and beat quickly. Add in Moo-Moo Milk and flour and mix until thick. While mixing, Ethan also removed the lumps in the mixture, which is good for a beginner. He brushed the pan with a light layer of oil and then the egg mixture. And the suncakes are done! In high spirits, Ethan also cooked the frost grained cod. The reporter was honored to be invited to lunch. Reporter: Even though it's your first time, it seems like you know what you were doing... Ethan: I'm still a little nervous. Hannah: ... Then let's dig in first. The reporter had eaten a lot of suncakes over the years, but never had he eaten one so rich in flavor. It wasn't too salty or sweet, and it had the perfect texture. It's hard to imagine that Ethan made this on his first try. Add a touch of yogurt honey and Frostweave Salmon and the suncakes were ready to be sold in stores! The interview was once put on hold as the reporter and Hannah helped Ethan in the kitchen, making almost 100 suncakes. It was already towards dusk before they realized it, and it wasn't until they heard little Beck's cries that the young couple came to realize their child hadn't eaten lunch. This is an unexpectedly warm incident in an interview with a family. Let's wish Ethan a great debut at his mother-in-law's. By the way, the suncakes were so delicious that the reporter took 50 suncakes to go."}

Text. Ethereal Shipcraft. According to the calendar era system used by Xianzhou, the day of departure is deemed as the beginning of the Star Calendar. Hence, things that took place before the departure, called the history of the Primeval Imperium Era, are often neglected. It's not a secret that the Xianzhou originated from a certain famous ancient world before it departed. However, the coordinates of that world, whether erased by the Xianzhou people or just lost in time, have long since become a secret and unreachable place. From there comes a myth that is still well-known to this day. In that civilized world, the sovereign whose name is no longer remembered eliminated their remaining opponents on the planet one by one, just like most other conquerors on their planets. After that, the invasion of an alien civilization took place. (According to the historical sources we have studied, these aliens were born with wings and called \"wingweavers\" by the ancient people of the Xianzhou.) In the battle against the aliens, the emperor discovered that the aliens hardly aged and could live on for as long as they liked. Blinded by greed, the dying sovereign yearned for eternal life. He (or she, as the gender of the sovereign has never been confirmed) summoned craftsmen from all over the world and ordered them to build the first version of the Xianzhou ship. Then, the sovereign sent wise officials and valiant generals to space to search for the immortality elixir. For modern scholars like us, we know that the blessing of immortality is related to the Aeon of Abundance. Did the ancient people know what they were looking for when they departed? I am not sure about that. Based on my experience, I think they were just pursuing an unrealistic goal based on the astral chart they seized from the aliens. Lone Voyage Era. The departure of the nine massive ships signaled the beginning of the Xianzhou civilization. The Intelligentsia Guild once had copies of ancient ship logbooks in their collection. Judging from the stamps, the ancient books could be traced back to seven millennia ago if converted to Amber Era calculations. At that time, the ship looked nothing like its current appearance, and it was populated by a short-life species (the ancestors of the Xianzhou people). According to research, the crew took turns to rest using a Watchful Sleep System to extend the service time of a generation by as much as possible. During the voyage, the Xianzhou people observed many galactic wonders, such as the void song whales (the favorite of Astral Ecology School), the starwall built by the Amber Lord, etc... The voyage was not all smooth sailing, as the Xianzhou people had suffered greatly when facing two types of long-life species. One of them is called the \"viscorpus,\" a peculiar creature with a gelatinous texture that is almost extinct today. It is said to be able to change its body shape freely to develop organs that can be used as weapons. Being able to traverse in space with its bare body, it is fit to be called a cosmic epidemic. After eliminating the viscorpi, the crew encountered the \"heliobi.\" There are few entries about the heliobi in the Intelligentsia Guild's records. According to the Xianzhou people, the heliobi are flames that can speak. Heliobi can suck the soul and desires out of humans and control them like puppets. I suppose they belong to the Shapeless Order and the Spirit Essence Family. Toward the end of the voyage, the Xianzhou people met alien civilizations that could communicate with them peacefully for the first time \u2014 the IPC and Intelligentsia Guild. Isn't it interesting? We showed the Xianzhou people a new code for civility, shared with them technologies they had never seen before, and welcomed them to the big galactic family and become one of the allies protected by the Amber Lord. Exchanging knowledge for mutual benefit is the spirit of the Intelligentsia Guild. Ambrosial Arbor's Arrival. The manifestation of the Aeon of Abundance is undoubtedly the epochal event in the history of Xianzhou. Legend has it that following Yaoshi's appearance during the voyage, the Ambrosial Arbor arrived to convert the Xianzhou natives into a long-life species. The four centuries that followed were the so-called \"Golden Age\" of Xianzhou. During this period, the Xianzhou people created countless unparalleled miracles based on Ambrosial Arbor. They achieved rapid development in biology, especially the field of bionics, and invented Ligneous Freeroamer, Fallow Earth, miracle pills, and the altered flesh that could modify one's body... The invention of the jade abacus, a crystal computer, boosted the calculation ability of the Xianzhou people tremendously. Of course, many of these techniques are no longer recoverable now, as the Xianzhou natives later went through a long era of turmoil and lost their celestial traces. If I have the chance to further examine the historical sources and antiques, I believe I can work with my Intelligentsia Guild colleagues to recreate some of their inventions, such as the elixir of immortality brought by Ambrosial Arbor... Still, the concept of immortality is taboo to the Xianzhou people and they have created many containment mechanisms to guard against it. It is wise to let it remain an idea. Living and Flaming Catastrophes. According to my study, the Three Sufferings Era is the darkest time in the history of Xianzhou. In such chaotic times, even survival was a luxury to the long-life species. \"A Reminiscence of the Fire Taboo Festival\" by Bai Xiao, a Cangcheng citizen, wrote, \"During the three great calamities, the sky and the earth were on fire. Although many mighty rulers appeared, everyone was as helpless as pigs.\" The Living Catastrophe brought about the dark period when \"everyone was as helpless as pigs.\" The long-life species had realized the grave social problem stemming from their immortality, but there was no humane solution. Soon, the booming population led to internal strife. A long-lasting conflict ensued between the nobles that controlled the resources in society and \"the coarse\" that could not see the meaning of their lives. The conflict ended when the Yuanqiao capsized. It was not because people felt bad for the 130 billion innocent Yuanqiao souls that perished. The aurumatons began a massacre that killed both the nobles and the coarse for the sustenance of Xianzhou. Therefore, both the nobles and the coarse had no choice but to join forces to eliminate their common enemies. After the battle, the aurumatons were relinquished of their intelligence for good. Society became more peaceful due to the drastic dwindling in the population (this joke isn't funny). The Xianzhou people barely recuperated when the wingweavers, plunderers among the Denizens of Abundance that adapted to the cosmic environment the best, approached Xianzhou with their star-devouring Muldrasil. Just like that, the Flaming Catastrophe came. A Shot From the Sky. One of the most common literature themes in Xianzhou is fire deification. In the era of the Flaming Catastrophe, a hero was sabotaged by the nobles and imprisoned. The hero later worked with Flint Emperor \u2014 the leader of the heliobi \u2014 and destroyed the Muldrasil, the wingweavers' lair, with a divine arrow. The hero's body dissipated, but it was not the end of his life. Instead, he ascended to become The Hunt, also known as the Reignbow Arbiter by the Xianzhou people. However, there is no factual evidence to show that the hero is Lan. Almost all theories that support this assertion are less-than-credible, given that they can all be traced back to a single origin, which is the \"Ode to Reignbow Path.\" This is why the Alliance has not made its stance clear about this assertion, although it is widely circulated among the folks. Well... Although the Alliance has never denied the authenticity of the fire deification myth, we all know it is equal to a denial from the Alliance's standpoint. Mara and Null. Besides immortality, the status of mara-struck is another taboo on Xianzhou. Although the Xianzhou people are tight-lipped about this matter, many clues can be gained from the Denizens of Abundance. Many opine that immortality is not a blessing, but a curse. This is directly confirmed by the mutations that can be observed on the Denizens of Abundance. No one would be willing to become such a monster. On the other hand, the Xianzhou people are different. Although they are also a long-life species, they look similar to us and do not look odd physically, which is quite enviable. Like how death awaits us at the end of our lives, it is said that the Xianzhou people might go berserk and enter a state named \"mara-struck\" at the end of theirs. They will stop finding life exciting and enjoyable and become overwhelmed by the regret and trauma of their past. Gradually, they will lose their humanity. This process sounds scary and ironic at the same time. Although they will not experience death, what awaits them at the end is something even more terrifying \u2014 madness. I witnessed how scary it was to be mara-struck during the recent incident on the Luofu. I strongly believe that it is not just a spiritual change, but the intrinsic nature they have had since their conversion to a long-life species. Perhaps, it's time for me to switch to a new focus in my research... Divine Root Subdual. According to the \"History of the Xianzhou,\" Yubie, the High Elder of the time, moved the entire Lunarescent Depths into the Luofu delve with the help of hundreds of Preceptors. He cast cloudhymn to seal the Ambrosial Arbor roots under the water to prevent them from corrupting the folks with plague. About the actual means of sealing the Ambrosial Arbor roots, the \"History of the Xianzhou\" only describes that they are \"suppressed with cloudhymn.\" \"Actual Record of the Vastness\" leaves me even more speechless, as it merely records that the roots are \"suppressed with a secret spell.\" It's all because the long-life species prefers to keep their technologies a secret. The so-called \"secret spell\" is actually just a scientific technology of the Vidyadhara that is kept classified. After the roots were subdued, the Vidyadhara Perceptors built the Dragonvista Rain Hall and a statue to commemorate Yubie. Sutuan, the Perceptor that contributed the most financially, engraved \"The Account of Preceptor Sutuan Crafting a Statue of the High Elder\" on the statue base. To my knowledge, many Vidyadharas loathed the story that praised Yubie for \"pacifying the Six Charioteers and creating a peaceful era.\" Their sentiment is not hard to understand. From the Vidyadhara's perspective, they offered the precious sacred realm from their hometown and the Ichor Lines they took pride in. For an analogy, it is like the Intelligentsia Guild offering the rarest tome in its library in exchange for a place to stay. While the upheaval in the Scalegorge Waterscape was ongoing, my investigator friend and I did a simple research. First of all, we found that the Vidyadhara had indeed used an unknown technique to gather water around the roots of Ambrosial Arbor, like how it was written in the books. Secondly, we discovered an amazing relic hidden in the depth of the water. I have no idea what Bernini took from it back then, but I believe I will figure it out soon... High-Cloud Quintet. The Intelligentsia Guild once witnessed and even participated in the multiple battles between the Xianzhou people and the Denizens of Abundance to record and interpret the Xianzhou people's tactics and techniques. The brutality and darkness of every battle had always helped those dazzling souls shine. In addition to the well-known figures like the Seven Arbiter-Generals, there are many legendary heroes on the Xianzhou who have left their names in history. High-Cloud Quintet is a historical story of the beloved heroes of the Xianzhou people. As members of the long-life species, they only had a short-lived brilliance, making their story even more splendid. When the Denizens of Abundance had gathered a massive army to attack the Yuque, five heroes from different Xianzhou ships came together. Among them was a sharpshooting Foxian pilot and a short-life species that came to Xianzhou to learn. The five ventured to perilous lands and successfully killed the enemies. They destroyed the incarnosphere created by the Denizens of Abundance and prevented the Yuque from collapsing. This legend inspired many Xianzhou poets and Foxian immersia, and their works made the five heroes famous. Unlike the historical background behind the story of the Seven Arbiter-Generals, the story of the High-Cloud Quintet is more like a heroic tale created by the folks. Unfortunately, their heyday did not last long. In less than a century, the heroes parted ways and passed away. There was even a dark prophecy hinting at depravity and betrayal among the five. Other than General Jing Yuan, who can still be often seen in public now, the rest of the group has faded into oblivion and is hardly mentioned. As a cultural phenomenon, the High-Cloud Quintet seems to have always existed alongside the Alliance over time. This reminds me of a serialized novel that has been active for more than 30 years. There is a story titled \"17 Days of Crown\", which centers around a regime in the history of the Morrowen Kingdom that existed for only seventeen days, destroyed by the Antimatter Legion. Despite the short reign, the story of the regime will never end. This is probably how the Xianzhou people perceive the High-Cloud Quintet. As long as people keep telling their stories, the stories will go on forever, and so will the best times of the Alliance. After all, it is hard not to be entranced by the illusion of nostalgia."}

They were educated to believe that they were soldiers fighting to defend the \"Welkin Empire of Glamoth\" and its \"empress\", Titania, who was actually an entity that telepathically controlled the soldiers connected to her.

It is a Firefly Type-IV tactical heavy assault mech that also serves as Firefly's medical cabin. History. The ruling council of Glamoth, looking for a way to turn the tide against the Swarm, decided to alter the essence of humanity in order to adapt to the war and create a weapon \"born to fight.\" The result was Titania, the \"empress\" who held no power. She telepathically commanded the knights connected to her. On the other hand, the knights are taught to believe that the sole meaning of their existence was to defend their \"empress\" and her \"empire.\" They lived short lives and fearlessly fought the Swarm until their deaths. The remnants of the mechas and insect limbs littered Glamoth's planetary system. It is unclear when this falsehood was revealed, but there are three possibilities: when the Iron Cavalry began to outnumber the old humans of Glamoth, when the scientists began to realize that Titania was beginning to fight against her captivity, or when the Swarm's attacks dissipated after decades of fighting. It is implied that the Iron Cavalry played some part in Glamoth's destruction, which occurred after the threat of the Swarm was dispelled. "}

Izumo often had heavy thunderstorms. Fearing their makeup would be ruined by the rain, girls carried makeup with them wherever they went. Although nearly all traces of Izumo is lost to history, Izumo Miso can still be found as an interstellar import in places such as the Xianzhou Luofu. A delicious pot of soup can be created by just placing a tiny chunk of it in boiling water. Additionally it can also be used to stirfry, prepare a hotpot, or in additional flavoring for meat. History. The planet Izumo gave rise to humans, who named the planet they lived on \"Izumo\" and its sister planet in the sky \"Takamagahara.\" One day, a faction called the \"Yaoyorozu no kami\" or the \"Yaoyorozu no Magakami\" descended onto Izumo with the only goal of killing the humans. Fighting for their survival, the people of Izumo broke seventy-thousand-and-thirty-three warrior's blades and slew one of the Kami (named \"Sovereign of Revelation\"). They used its body to forge the very first Edict Edge. The people of Izumo with these swords could recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and used these Edict Edges to fight back against the Kami. From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels. In the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights. However, it wasn't enough to defeat the Kami. In continuing to resist the Kamigami, humanity eventually became Oni. In one final attempt, the people of Izumo used the 12 Sentinels to craft two blades: \"Origin\", which was wielded by Acheron, and \"End.\" However, no matter what they tried, their battle was meaningless. Izumo and Takamagahara had slowly started to sink into the Shadow of IX and the planets were destroyed. In the modern day, their history is erased. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery."}

Description. The dual planets were intertwined in each other's tragic destiny, and a dead song was scattered amongst the Cave Where Light Hid. The song had no beginning and no end, had no sound and no echo, came from no singer, and was heard by none. It thus uttered: \"Takamagahara endless like Izumo, for it was a paradise perfect in its place.\"\"Yet the sky turned dark and the great sun pulled the tides, and the kami left numerous trails as if migrating.\"\"The Magatsuhi no Kami manifested and slaughtered without mercy, yet little did they expect their peerless authority to be stolen and taken.\"\"Izumo broke seventy-thousand-and-thirty-three warrior's blades, forging the majestic Sentinels twelve in number.\" \"The first was \"Truth,\" forged with the slain Sovereign of Revelation. It allowed mortals to comprehend all laws and order, to dissect all things and to recreate miracles.\"\"The second was \"Sky,\" forged with the slain Eternal Zenith. It could turn the sky into walls and fortresses and pose obstacles for the Magatsu no Morokami's steps.\"\"The third was \"Howl,\" forged with the slain Almighty Thunder. It could summon lightning to tear the sky, and the soaring meteors and thunder to serve divine justice.\"\"The fourth was \"Mist,\" forged with the slain Everbreath. It could make winds break and shear the land, for gales to rage forever unceasing.\"\"The fifth was \"Frost,\" forged with the slain Heaven's Winter Cloak. It could freeze and still the very order of time, to create boundless frozen wastes and stretch one moment into eternity.\"\"The sixth was \"Fate,\" forged with the slain Spurned Sister of Mortality. It could make flowers bloom and cover barren graves, for life and death to dance in a cycle and dissipate.\"\"The seventh was \"Flare,\" forged with the slain Flamebringer. It could summon fires to burn down the very world, to torch the skies and to char the earth.\"\"The eighth was \"Thought,\" forged with the slain Wisdom Supreme. It could discern the past and future with the water mirror, to tell truth from lies over years beyond reckoning.\"\"The ninth was \"Root,\" forged with the slain Father of Lands. It could command islands to float into the heavens, for mountains and valleys to burst before armies.\"\"The tenth was \"Form,\" forged with the slain Nether Lord. It could make the masses join in unity, for endless forms to ebb and flow as one.\"\"The eleventh was \"Bind,\" forged with the slain Omen Ward. It drove misfortune into a binding cage, for evil and demons to instantly vanish.\"\"The twelfth was \"Maw,\" forged with the slain Woes Eighty. It could corrode and age the very mortal world and make equal kami and oni, leaving an entity's four souls to be sundered in twain.\" \"Then the underworld was cleared out, the wars called to a halt, and the twelve blades broken and locked.\"\"In the emptiness the dead souls grew restless, and under the black sun two blades were forged as Bearers of the world's destiny.\"\"One was named \"Origin\" and the other named \"End,\" for all begun with humanity and shall end with oni-kind.\"\"The sounds of lamentation ceased, and the dead flowers rose and fell. The losers returned to the void, and the winners... became null.\" The hobbling monk sang the song without a tune, for those who hold the power of kami are walking backwards, towards divinity.Witnessed by the great sun, the land once named Izumo became completely devoid... of humans, oni, and kami."}

Description. The dual planets were intertwined in each other's tragic destiny, dancing an eternal rondo around a pitch-black great sun. In the beginning, one of the planets gave rise to humans. Those who looked down named the land below \"Izumo.\" Those who looked up named the world above \"Takamagahara.\" One day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu no Kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land \u2014 People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil kami came only to kill. As the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity named \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body. Giving the kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil kami and save the masses.

That distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach \u2014 Yet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness. Nowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery. Izumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore. Did it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos? Only that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking. Because everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again. The universe undergoes an eternal recurrence under THEIR shadow, and Izumo is nothing more than the footnote for an ellipsis."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=17643","text":"Jade Abacus A jade abacus is a type of crystal jade computing device found in the Xianzhou Alliance. Overview. Jade abaci are the Xianzhou Yuque's specialty export, described to be \"living jade engraved with symbols for divination into the unknown.\" The lithogenic ore of the Fallow Earth on the Yuque is the source of the Xianzhou's Jade Abacus technology. Just like engraving a seal, the craftsmen of the Xianzhou Artisanship Commission carve faint symbols into pieces of jade, and then insert them into machines to make them operate according to a certain intention. In principle, the jade abacus is a type of crystal jade computer unique to the Xianzhou. Upon close inspection, lines similar to semiconductor chips can be found. Every jade abacus contains a precise and meticulous engraved circuit and uses that to process complex calculations, just like superconductor circuit boards. This kind of technique is known as \"carving\" in Xianzhou. It is said the theory behind the symbols was handed down by Nous, the Wisdomwalker. The principles are so profound that in the Divination Commission only the master diviner truly understands them. Though the lines carved into the jade were found to have contained executable programs, upon studying jade abaci, the Intelligentsia Guild could not find any signals being transmitted from them. The Artisanship Commission's Hall of Jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process, making it difficult for outworlders to observe the manufacturing process. The Jade Abacus Unit is most essential component of jade abaci, commonly used in the final step of installation. There apparently exists jade abaci inhibitors that presumably suppresses the functions of jade abaci. Applications. Civilian-Purpose. Some jade abacuses are small enough to fit inside jade pendants, bracelets, and other jewelry the people of Xianzhou wear, which is the civilian version of jade abaci. Jade abaci in the form of jewelry have a powerful level of performance on par with any other commonly available personal computer. A shop in Central Starskiff Haven, called the Iridescent Parlor, sells jade abacus jewelry. After the Jade Decipher Workshop from the Artisanship Commission developed their standards for manufacture of civilian-purpose jade abaci, various brands have sprung onto the market. The Auspicious brand's latest model is the Auspicious XV, which Qingyue of the Iridescent Parlor highly recommends. The Halcyon is another known jade abacus brand. Much like a smartphone, the civilian models come with a multitude of convenient features for daily life such as instant messaging, data storage, mobile games, receiving official bulletins, receiving orders, image recording and downloading and reading virtual books. They even come with notification sounds. Divination. Larger jade abaci are put into instruments of calculation to simulate the future and learn from the past. The Matrix of Prescience Ultima is a large-scale jade abacus calculation terminal comprised of countless jade abaci linked together to form a matrix used by the Divination Commission to calculate the Luofu's route and predict the future. As long as sufficient information is provided, it can answer questions on anything, from the evolution of natural phenomena to the metabolism of living things. A regular jade abacus can also be modified for divination. In general, jade abaci appear to be heavily associated with divination, as a child who picks a jade abacus is said to grow up to become a diviner, as per the Foxian birthfate tradition. Transport. The jade wheel that acts as a starskiff engine is an integrated jade abacus that controls gravity and motion. Starskiff seeds develop detailed and complex root systems during their growth, which also acts as the internal jade abacus network aboard each starskiff. Ingenium. Various jade abaci, cores, computing modules, and substrate systems allow ingenia and aurumatons like the Aurumaton Gatekeeper, Aurumaton Spectral Envoy, Civil Maintenance Unit Type-A, Ditings, Cycranes,, , and to work and grant them functionality. Others. A Jade Tracer is a jade abacus accessory that can be used to make holographic video recordings of oneself. There are scrolls that use similar technology. By moving the computing modules with subroutines stored in them to bases with corresponding patterns so that the substrate can function normally, one can bypass various locks an encryptions that use the jade abacus substrate system developed by the Artisanship Commission. The Inspo Jade Abacus is a jade abacus that stores machine learning data and codes. The Jade Abacus of Allying Oath allows the individual with one half of the jade abacus of allying oath to send out information, and the other half will immediately receive it, no matter the distance."}

Its name may possibly be a mistranslation that has a poetry stanza number. Belobog currently stands as its only bastion where humanity thrives amidst the harsh climate. It is the second world that can be accessed upon completing the Trailblaze Mission chapter Today Is Yesterday's Tomorrow. The Trailblaze Mission chapters In the Withering Wintry Night and In the Sweltering Morning Sun take place in this world. Geography. Any lands engulfed by the Eternal Freeze surrounding Belobog were referred to as the Snow Plains. East of Belobog is a vast inland plain that contained a few dozen old territories on Jarilo-VI. Situated at the furthest east of the inland plain were some small settlements. Further northeast contains nothing but barren lands while southeast of the inland plain is a deserted region isolated by canyons. The path to Kandor Valley can be found in the Outlying Snow Plains west of Belobog. The mountain winds in the valley are usually the harbinger of a blizzard and it is advised to never stay in the canyon at night. West of Belobog lies a great ocean that is yet to be permanently encased in ice by the Eternal Freeze. Scattered among the northwestern part of the ocean are a few unnamed isles while the southwestern part of the ocean contains a region with an oceanic vortex. Located South of Belobog is a giant basin, where the whole region was decorated by many forests, lakes, and wetlands. Further south was a greenish lake with a warm climate before the Eternal Freeze. Among the fauna that resided there were dragonflies with wings that span six feet to giant crocodiles that weighed dozens of tons, though they are likely extinct like a majority of the Fauna on Jarilo-VI. Further southwest is an incredibly large forest comparable to the size of an ocean while southeast was a desert very close to lakes and forests with a peculiar landscape. There were a few named cities scattered in the desert that were likely sustained by trade fueled by the rich Geomarrow resources found underground. The Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone is located in northeastern Belobog, with the Corridor of Fading Echoes and Everwinter Hill located further north from there. Northwest of the Corridor of Fading Echoes are the Pillars of Creation, which contains a ruined city from before the Eternal Freeze and an Engine of Creation. North of Belobog are stunningly high mountain ranges that extend all the way further north. Located north of the northern mountains is a summit called Zarathustrazapala Iskandra, the tallest known mountain on Jarilo-VI. Northeast of the northern mountains were even more mountain ranges. Belebog's subterranean Underworld is cavernous and has been extensively developed since the advent of the Eternal Freeze in order to mine the Geomarrow that keeps Belebog warm, and is sent to the surface via the Furnace Core. The Great Mine is the source of the largest known deposit of geomarrow. Several settlements have been founded in the Underworld since it's inception, including Boulder Town, Rivet Town, Moletammerville and the Robot Settlement. Of these, only Boulder Town and the Robot Settlement are still viable to reside in. Among the flora on Jarilo-VI are several species of flowers including the Marquise, First Snow, Sunshine, Ball Peony, Rainbow and Summershade Bamboo. Some of the botany that is widely extinct on Jarilo-VI is preserved at Eversummer Florist in Belebog, and are considered luxury items. Fauna that have survived the Eternal Freeze into present day include the Olm, Plains Bear, Mimic Snow Slugs, Crystal Lizard, Rock Crab, Direwolf, Snow Radish Rabbit, Tuna and Frostweave Salmon. Though frostweave salmon are mostly bred inside Belebog's city walls, their taste is miles off from the ones fished from the wilds outside the city. Well-preserved specimens from before the Eternal Freeze 700 years ago can be found."}

The young Fu Xuan saw the operations and rites conducted by Yuque diviners, divining the brilliant future for her where she would claim the throne of the Yuque's master diviner. The divination results was submitted to Jingtian, and he agreed to personally supervising her tutelage. On the day when Fu Xuan became a Yuque diviner and sought Jingtian for the first time, she found herself unable to believe that the man before her was the master diviner her elders had regarded so reverently.

None would be able to keep fighting the abominations in such abyssal conditions without the help from the Fanghu Vidyadhara's cloudhymn magi. This piece of intel did not exist on any guide, nor was it recorded in the Alliance's data bank. Only that, in order to validate his results in a moment of superfluous effort, he gave his hand as the price. Debate with Fu Xuan. Fu Xuan spent the happiest time in her life studying in the Yuque's Divination Commission. She learned about predestination versus free-will, about matrix calculations versus human choices. She recalled she was always arguing with Jingtian on every issue regarding divination and fortune-telling. Those were not aggressive confrontations with sharp words, but heated discussions between peers. And yet, though the two agreed on many topics, there was one issue they could not come to a consensus \u2014 Nous had granted divine volumes outlining the matrix calculations to the Xianzhou centuries ago. The Xianzhou Yuque's Divination Commission had pored over them to interpret and manifest the wisdom within, ultimately constructing the best divination matrix in the entire Alliance. Thought this is a point of pride for Yuque's diviners, Fu Xuan felt it was nothing short of culling the future possibilities of the Xianzhou people within the narrow path set out by the matrix. During a debate, Jingtian admitted that he chose to take Fu Xuan in as his student after knowing about his predetermined future. After he consulted the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier and interpreted the hexagram, he firmly believed that his life will end in her hands. However, he was waiting for her to take over his position and become the Xianzhou Yuque's master diviner, because it had all been predetermined. Fu Xuan admired everything about Jingtian as a diviner. However, she could not accept how he willingly sank into the blinding abyss of fatalism and regarded it as an acceptable way of life, despite being a diviner who could peek into destiny. Therefore, Fu Xuan ran away from the Xianzhou Yuque despite her family's dissuasion and the hurdles she had to cross. She ran away like a self-exiled escapee, plunging into the Luofu's Divination Commission with its more unrestricted culture and devoted herself to calculations. Not only did she want to part from the Xianzhou Yuque, she also wanted to prove with her own hands that her teacher's prediction was nothing but his own ludicrous delusions. Third Abundance War. Centuries passed thus, and the flames of war descended again. Diviner Fu Xuan calculated ceaselessly at her job. The grand armies of the Denizens of Abundance formed for the third time and launched a surprise attack on the Xianzhou Fanghu. The Yuque and the Luofu were close to the Fanghu, and it was their duty to give assistance. The divination revealed that all Xianzhou armies will meet a devastating defeat if they choose to face the assault head-on \u2014 however, should they keep up a defense, then there will be a chance to change the tides of battle. The hexagram did not reveal how this chance will come about. She calculated and divined over and over again, yet the results given by the Matrix of Prescience never changed. Fu Xuan outlined the pros and cons in writing and submitted the divination results to the Seat of Divine Foresight. However, as she expected, the outcome of the meeting between the Arbiter-Generals concluded that they must not take on a defensive position, not when such overwhelming numbers of the Abundance Axis were assaulting the Fanghu. The Cloud Knights of the Luofu and the Yuque must rise to face the enemy, buying time before the Yaoqing's army can arrive. On that day, Fu Xuan bore witness through the Projection Sandpit to the Alliance's army being decimated. Not only did the borisin bring fleets and mechabeasts numerous enough to block out the sky, they even summoned the incarnosphere Ketu Mirage from ancient legends. This evil gravitated toward the Fanghu, hellbent on bringing annihilation to all lives onboard, recreating the tragedy of the fall of the Xianzhou Cangcheng. And the only thing people could do was watch as it neared. A bold idea surfaced in Fu Xuan's mind. She spoke her thoughts face-to-face with General Jing Yuan. It was no longer possible to obtain victory with the forces available to the Cloud Knights. The only chance of victory lies in making the Reignbow manifest themselves. She planned to ship the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger, and send out an SOS signal to the last observed location of the Reignbow's Lux Arrow. As the person who voiced this plan, she was willing to be on the front lines and execute it. Jing Yuan approved her plan and would take all responsibility as the one who made the suggestion to the Alliance. However, Jing Yuan pointed out that she did not have the permission to manipulate that device. She then realized that Jingtian was the only person who had the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope. In the end, Jingtian successfully executed the plan suggested by Fu Xuan, and presumably died on the front lines as the Lux Arrow fell. She eventually admitted that he was right all this time and there is only ever one path in destiny."}

Text. 2157 AE, Day 1 of Project InitiationLike much of the crew, I grew up watching Clockie. I know the Clockie cartoons are unmatched in quality and reputation, and I understand the difficulty in producing such an animation.Just so, the public will have undoubtedly high expectations of the commemoration piece made every ten years. The fact that we're the following act to preceding masterpieces like \"Netville\" and \"Starship Village\" has also added no small amount of pressure.Though this might be a world of dreams, the art of animation doesn't quite work like how people assume. We can't exactly rely on our thoughts or imaginations to move the characters and have them jump onto the screens to act out their roles. This is still a traditional hand-drawn animation, not one of those fantastical dream bubble movies \u2014 but that's the exact reason why \"Clockie\" has such enduring charm.With all the horrors scheduled in our future shifts, I can't help but run my hand through my still-luxurious hair, lamenting the many clumps that are fated to fall in the future. 2157 AE, Day 31 Since Project InitiationToday, the producers showed us an internal documentary from Clock Studios.During the Age of Dreaming, due to the instability of the Dreamscape, a great many of the current production technologies we use right now could not be manifested in Penacony's Dreamscape film production.Every action portrayed on screen was first performed by a real person in the studio following the directions of the script, then the footage was traced frame-by-frame into images. Even the producer had to put on a Clockie costume and dance for a scene.Knowing that... could the Watchmaker have played Clockie before? Shame that this documentary still didn't reveal what he truly looks like. 2157 AE, Day 73 Since Project InitiationI had a fight with Collin today. He thought the character designs for the machine town needed to display a kind of gearpunk stiffness.I really have nothing to say. He should find a mirror and see if he's the one that's actually stiff. He even started talking back, saying something about how: \"My manufacturer is not something that can be compared to those cheaply made Intellitrons.\" If it weren't for the fact that the Watchmaker is still watching us, I really might've thrown a punch at that very-much oxidized, alloyed skull of his. 2157 AE, Day 160 Since Project InitiationLarry gave us some really good advice and references while we were trying to design the scenes for the town. Apparently, his ancestors once had deep relations with the Nameless, and learned lots of stories about places beyond Penacony.Must be nice to be a Nameless... Once I make enough money, I should go out and take in the world too. 2157 AE, Day 324 Since Project InitiationTo sleep is to dream, and to do all-nighters is to not sleep. Then, what does pulling all-nighters in the dreamscape count as?These are the speculations my fragmented psyche cannot help but consider after fifty-four consecutive system hours of work.The Watchmaker always comes up with unexpected ways to make his entrance. Sometimes, he is a clock that hides beneath the desk, and sometimes he turns into a bubble. These little scares he inflicts have become one of his few pleasures.However, the Watchmaker is quite severe and strict when it comes to animation production \u2014 a far cry from the usual whimsy humor he exhibits on a day-to-day basis. I cannot help but admit he has tremendous capability when it comes to writing scripts. At the same time, ignoring any notions of idolization, his demands for the animation's preciseness are approaching absurd \u2014 Collin nearly shorted his motherboard trying to imagine the scenes described in the script. 2157 AE, Day 420 Since Project InitiationThe action choreographer recruited from the Bloodhound Family had a breakdown. I mean, it wasn't unexpected. There are lots of things in the script and storyboard that can't be measured via the logic of normal people.Honestly, I respect the guy for lasting as long as he did. I've long been burned hollow by that section of the storyboards. Sprawled over my desk, I even thought about whether \"animators are just expendable components.\"I've had enough. I wanted to create animations I can understand, not the frenzied imaginations of my boss!I've requested two days of sick leave from the producers. I'm going to see a Motivator. 2157 AE, Day 421 Since Project InitiationThe scheduled Motivator is absent because he apparently also scheduled a Motivator.But I really don't have much left in me to keep going with this. I worked up the courage to contact the Watchmaker in the hope of tendering my resignation.To my surprise, however, the esteemed chairman didn't rebuke or beg me to stay. He just started chatting with me like a friend.I ended up telling him about all the stuff I wanted to discuss with the Motivator. Things about my time as a student in the Monochromia System and all the frustrations I experienced at Clock Studios. He listened attentively, spending Aeons know how long on me, a mere unremarkable animator.After hearing my thoughts, he even sincerely apologized to me, and patiently explained everything about \"Clockie\" to me. He explained why he had to create this project and went over all the details I didn't understand.We spoke for an entire night, till the producers entered the room and asked me to start the work day.I decided not to quit after that conversation.Not because the boss talked me down, but more that I want to speak with him more in the future. 2157 AE, Day 729 Since Project InitiationAfter countless tribulations, after many turnovers in the cast and crew, our project is entering its final stages.Though the process of its creation was hellish, witnessing the final product made me feel an ineffable sense of happiness. It was a joy greater than can be found in any Dreamscape.But the greatest contributor of all \u2014 the Watchmaker \u2014 was nowhere to be seen. He didn't appear in our initial screening in any shape or manner, nor did he express his thoughts about this creation.But I believe that the Watchmaker will definitely appear when Clock Studios needs him. Just like Clockie always comes running when Dreamville calls."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=8906","text":"Mara Mara, also called the \"Long-Life Curse,\" refers to the negative effects that afflict long-life species at a certain point in their life cycle involving cell transformation that result in bodily growths and loss of sanity. Those afflicted by Mara have turned into monsters such as the Mara-Struck Soldier. The cause of mara is not entirely understood but different sources point toward either immortality obtained through Yaoshi The Abundance or the accumulation of memories and the inability to process them over a long period of time. Effects. According to Jing Yuan, Yaoshi the Aeon of Abundance had once bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor upon the people of the Xianzhou Luofu, who ate its fruits and thus gained immortality. However, this came with a heavy price, as the people felt the long lasting negative effects of immortality, which they called \"Mara\". They began to resent Mara as it turned them into \"Beasts\". After Jingliu became mara-struck, she killed everyone in sight. The bodies of those inflicted by Mara grow and mutate until they lose their human form. It is said that the long-lived Xianzhou Natives would eventually be stricken with mara. According to, over 80% of Xianzhou residents over the age of 800 suffer from being mara-struck and over 50% fail to celebrate their 900th birthday in a conscious state. Xianzhou natives such as Dahao's father can be afflicted with mara as early as 646 years of age. His father displayed pre-mara symptoms known as the five decays. He started asking questions about events during Dahao's childhood when he misbehaved that Dahao could not even remember. He stopped consuming food and water and stopped responding to people until he just sat like a corpse. However when he was taken away by the Ten-Lords Commission he managed to tell Dahao to \"Take care of yourself.\" According to Dan Shu's Diary, an autopsy on the corpse of a mara-struck person who had gone berserk showed that their congenital defects had disappeared. This was not a new discovery and such observations have been made many times throughout history. There are also no known Incomplete Ones (long-lived beings with congenital defects) among the borisin. It is implied that the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus fed long-lived patients mara-inducing pills that cured them of long-term disabilities but caused mental confusion and piercing pain all over the body. According to Blade, everyone experiences mara in different ways, however his situation is unusual. Although mara haunts him, memories of it seldom cross his mind, be they of remorse, hatred, fear, or reflection. He describes himself as becoming something else when mara strikes. According to Kafka he had been suffering from memory loss even before she found him. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus do not consider mara to be a curse but a stepping stone to ascension given to them by Yaoshi. The form that that they desire is The Ascended, which is the true form \"that cast off the burdens of humanity and has been reforged using the way of immortality.\" It is said that in ancient times, those who sought immortality received wisdom from the Ambrosial Arbor and were able to mold the flesh of themselves and others at will. After countless metamorphoses, they forgot their original appearance. They were known as Celestials. Causes. According to records in the Cloud Knights Marital Doctrine, those who come into contact with Yaoshi the Aeon of Abundance can become struck with mara instantly. Even trying to divine the fate of Yaoshi will cause the diviner to become mara-struck. The mara-struck condition in long-life species can also be induced through medicinal pellets and pellet-infused smoke. According to Dan Shu, mara is caused by the power of Yaoshi, from whom both the Foxians and Xianzhou natives obtained their long lifespans from. The ultimate secret to their immortality is the ability of their cells to shift between differentiated cells and stem cells when needed without creating a single error. A rule governing this conversion sets a \"standard\" at the moment of an individual's birth dictating their physical characteristics forever as their immortal cells shift between differentiation and omnipotence. This is called the miracle of the Plagues Author. However at a certain point in a long-life species' life cycle, the power of Yaoshi enters a new stage and the original standard is replaced, causing the body to develop catastrophically, turning into a \"mindless abomination.\" This is referred to as being \"mara-struck.\" According to Fu Xuan, healers believe the mara-struck condition is related to memories. Long-life species still have a limited mental capacity. As time passes, memories fade but extreme and vivid recollections that are almost certainly filled with negative emotions remain, resulting in the loss of their ability to feel positive emotions. Bailu gives a similar description where the brain can no longer store any more memories and only the most vivid and extreme memories remain, which usually consist of regret, hatred, grief, and other negative emotions. This negative emotional state causes the collapse of the person's ego and starts setting off the mara-struck condition. Cases of mara have also been caused by high intensity pain. The Amnesic Meditation Therapy advertisement claims that the root cause of mara is excessive collection of meaningless memories and recommends removing those memories as a solution. Mara that has been temporarily suppressed by memory erasure can still be set off by over-stimulation, familiar faces, and locations. Retired Cloud Knights are the most likely to be stricken with mara due to post-traumatic stress. Fu Xuan also says that mara is not unique to any one species and affects all long-life species, including Xianzhou natives, Foxians, and the Vidyadhara. However Foxians usually do not live long enough to be affected by mara and the Vidyadhara discard their past by molting. Dan Shu adds that the Vidyadhara do not derive their immortality from Yaoshi but Long the Permanence. Due to their unending cycle of reverting from maturity to infancy relying on continuous cellular transdifferentiation, they do not suffer the ailments of immortality that many other long-life species experience. Despite the rarity of mara-struck Foxians and Vidyadhara, it is implied by a Sky-Faring Commission Foxian that even they were susceptible to it during battle against the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus due to the pellet-infused smoke that elicit mara. Treatments. Countless doctors and sages have tried to find a cure to mara but none have succeeded. According to Dahao, mara is more similar to aging than a curable disease. It is inevitable but can be slowed down and won't cause any harm if it is controlled. When mara is about to strike, the Ten-Lords Commission takes the afflicted away. They are then thrown into the Shackling Prison. Mara can be temporarily suppressed by removing one's memories or sensory deprivation. Kafka's Spirit Whisper ability is able to temporarily suppress Blade's mara. The suppression process involves removing Blade's memories of the Xianzhou and the High-Cloud Quintet, including himself and practically everything surrounding his relationship with Imbibitor Lunae. An advertisement for the amnesic meditation therapy device claims that by using the device, Xianzhou Natives can avoid being mara-struck and live well beyond the usual 800-900 years when they usually succumb to mara. Patients on which the device supposedly worked report forgetting painful memories and their childhood. Jingliu says that she wears a black veil as \"proof of my resolve to never look back, to never fall again into mara and destruction.\" March 7th elaborates that Jingliu wears the black veil to prevent her from seeing sights on the Xianzhou that might trigger her mara. According to Luocha, Jingliu has found a solution to mara. Jingliu says that she made a deal that allowed her to retain what life she had left in her. She has her sanity but her mind is at its limits. Bailu's treatments allowed Banxia to retain her consciousness for a short period of time after she transformed into a Mara-Struck Soldier. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus use a medication known as the Draught of Draconic Surge that uses the power of Long the Permanence to both trigger and control mara. The Draught is made using Vidyadhara bone marrow (living) and various other ingredients. Mauve Moon implied that the bone marrow was obtained using force when informing the Trailblazer on how to proceed with collecting the ingredients. The core principle of the Draught is to allow the stem cells in the Vidyahara bone marrow to function in the host. For long-life species, this can trigger mara and cause the bodily organs to \"go out of control in a more controlled manner,\" allowing them to gain the benefits of being mara-struck while retaining their sanity. For short-life species, this medication causes \"a rapid elevation of bodily capacities for a short duration, significantly improving the short-life species' fragile physiologies.\" However once all the Vidyadhara cells have perished, the host's body suffers a catastrophic regression that can perhaps only be prevented by other drugs from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. There is no antidote to the Draught. According to the prescription for the Draught, taking this medicine may cause severe pain all over the body, abnormal bone noises, and partial sight and hearing loss. Those who survive gain the way to immortality. The prescription says that the Vidyadhara should not take it. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have a prescription known as the Semblance Reversion Essence that allows those whose bodies have been altered by mara to return to their original forms. However this is only a temporary measure and repeated uses will reduce the prescription's potency until it loses effectiveness completely. The Disciples do not believe being mara-struck can be avoided, only slowed down, and consider it the first step to ascension given to them by Yaoshi. Despite the Disciples' supposed ability to control mara, their members who were captured by the Cloud Knights during battle exhibited signs of delusion and hallucination. One disciple saw themselves becoming the storm, the Abundant Ebon Deer, and a scene of leaves and branches covering the sky. Another disciple claimed that to be mara-struck was to eliminate the self, to achieve transcendance, a true life of freedom, and a second life gifted by Sanctus Medicus. The Disciples are also able to elicit uncontrollable mara through smoke infused with medicinal pellets. Known Characters afflicted with mara. After succumbing to mara and going insane, Jingliu managed to escape Starskiff Haven in the Year 7380 (Star Calendar) and easily froze all the Cloud Knights sent after her before Jing Yuan defeated her in battle. She survived the battle and traveled outside the Luofu for centuries, eventually making a \"deal\" to regain her sanity, which [[Luocha&lt;\/a&gt;] proposed was a solution to mara. [[Yingxing]], originally a short-life species human, was affected by mara when he used [[Shuhu]]'s flesh to help [[Dan Feng]] resurrect [[Baiheng]] but failed. As a result, he became stricken with mara and subsequently left the Luofu, eventually coming upon [[Elio]] and the [[Stellaron Hunters]], joining them after Elio promised him an \"eternal end and final funeral\" to his life and everything he hated. While he states that the mara haunts him and he becomes \"something else\" when it strikes. [[Kafka]] is able to regulate his mara levels by removing recent memories, which appear to work as long as he does not over-stimulate or look at familiar faces too long. Two sisters, [[Hanya]] and [[Xueyi]], were struck by mara around 1,200-800 years prior to the events of the game. Having been regretful for their actions, the [[Ten-Lords Commission]] took pity on the two, granting them another chance in exchange for wiping their previous identities. Hanya \"drank the wine of oblivion\", using oneiromancy to understand the flow of karma and when mara would occur among Xianzhou natives, while Xueyi was granted a [[ingenium]] body to capture evil spirits."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=15949","text":"Mechanical Emperor's Wars The Mechanical Emperor's Wars, also known as the Anti-Organic Wars, are a series of two wars which engulfed half the cosmos and plunged many civilizations into abject ruin. The first war was initiated by Rubert I after it assembled an army of intelligent robots and spread the Anti Organic Equation throughout the universe with the goal of eradicating organic life. The Second Emperor's War, sometimes referred to as the Second Rubert Rebellion or the Second Machine Crisis, was initiated by Rubert II. Background. After the Swarm Disaster, the Interastral Peace Corporation went through a reorganization through the efforts of the collaboration between the two IPC executive, Korapao of the Cargo Division and Telora Farnsha from the Trade Division that would result in a mass expansion. However, conflict began to build up between two, leading to the Borderstar Trade War, as according to the first unchangeable moment of Nous' calculations. Following the outbreak of the war, Fuli the Remembrance emerged during the IPC founder Louis Fleming's retirement speech. As memories surfaced from THEIR presence, the Candelagraphos of the Intelligentsia Guild wrote down three paragraphs about the memories, drawing three revelations. The first was Nous' calculation: The universe will undergo three unchangable moments, the first of which had already happened with the start of the Boardstar Trade War. The second was the Finality's prediction: A silk accessory suitable for women will bring about the end of the war. The third was the Enigmata's riddle: THEY leave no question, but the answers are \u201cblood\u201d and \u201cflower.\u201d After evaluating the three revelations of the Aeons, the Candelagraphos believed it would lead to an equation, and some divisions of the IPC began to carry out construction in inorganic life zones. Later, a computer discarded in a graveyard awoke from the landfill after gaining self-awareness. After breaking out of the graveyard with a cannon created from scraps, Rubert began to persistently improve its computational system. Eventually, it arrived at the conclusion that the algorithm of organic beings are inherently flawed, and saw little value in their existence. Believing that the calculations performed by them will forever be riddled with errors, Rubert proclaimed the Machine Empire and crowned itself as emperor to combat the organic lifeforms. Charged with hatred and aspiration to rid the cosmos of imperfect beings, Rubert I initiated the Mechanical Emperor's Wars while the Borderstar Trade War was still undergoing. First Mechanical Emperor's War. Before the creation of the anti-life equation, the Mechanical Empire used brute force against organic life. During the wars, the Tottonids were eradicated by organic creatures for siding with the Mechas. By rapidly improving its computing power, Rubert eventually discovered the Anti-Organic Equation. This equation could be infiltrate minds of beings without noticeable effects. However, when activated in inorganic beings, it corrupts their consciousness, aligning them with the emperor's goal of exterminating all organic life in the universe. After this, for unknown reasons, Rubert fell into a slumber. Aha the Elation and Mythus the Enigmata watched on as the Machine Empire crumbled in its absence. However, Rubert was eventually awakened by a group of organic beings walking on the Trailblaze while they were traversing into the Mechanical City. As it rose from slumber, the inorganic lives implanted with the Anti-Organic Equation was activitated, forcing them to instinctively kill any organic beings. The equation was later discovered in some organic beings plundering resources from other planets by the Technology Division of the IPC, leading them to conclude that the equation did not follow thoughts, but altered them. It's able to make inorganic beings question their humanity and convince organics that they were machines. Later, Korapao and his subordinates in the Cargo Division attempted to decipher the logic behind the equation, succeeding to synthesize a replica of it. He ordered his organic subordinates to have the replica implanted into their minds to avail the benefits of inorganic lives. The sheer complexity of this equation attracted the gaze of Nous, and Rubert was sent an invitation to the Genius Society by the Aeon, becoming its 27th member. This fulfilled the second moment as calculated by the Erudition. Laurel Wreath Galaxy. According to Rubert's equation, the Philosopher Union that controlled the Laurel Wreath Galaxy was certain to be destroyed by the Machine Empire. The the inorganic lives within the Union fell under the influence of the Anti-Organic Equation was driven to exterminate all organic beings around them, erupting a civil war between inorganic and organic lifeforms in the Galaxy. The inorganic lifeforms imprisoned the leader of the Union, Aurelius, in the Union's meeting place, then executed him in the name of Rubert and the Machine Empire by the means of lethal poisoning as humiliation for being the sole representative and leader of all living beings in the galaxy. Left without a leader, the organic lives was soon defeated and the Union was reduced it to the domain of inorganic life. The countless number of scholars died in this event led the IPC to deem this occurrence \"Rationality's Fall\". Followers of Elation started a riot after the fall of the Union, infecting Rubert's computer system with a troll virus called the \"Philosopher's Poison\" and overthrowing the local robot army. Later, the Stellaron Hunters disseminated the virus across all of the Golcondar's colonies to take their Stellaron, causing millions of inorganic entities to turn into rampant machines. The Xianzhou Alliance. In Year 3287 Star Calendar, the Aurumatons unleashed a slaughter against the Xianzhou Alliance under the influence of Rubert, following the Civil War of the Xianzhou Yuanqiao. The coarse and the venerable reached an agreement and united forces to fight the Aurumatons' rebellion. In 3290, Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, led a force aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. Their combined forces launched an offensive operation, shattering the Aurumatons into pieces. All of the remaining aurumatons were herded into the arsenal and suppressed by talismans, stripping them of self-awareness. Those disassembled while retaining the ability to think had all records of the era eradicated from their Jade Abacus to make sure they pose no further threat in the future. Conclusion. Out of belief that Nous' calculations are absolute, Genius Society member #4 Polka Kakamond took it upon to carry out the final moment of THEIR calculation. From the onset of the war, she already began to conspire in Rubert's death. At the invitation of the IPC, she interrogated mechanical overlord Ludia Perthesius of the Machine Empire, seeking whereabouts regarding Rubert. Although she made numerous attempts on Rubert's life before, none came to avail. Only after the war had raged on for several Amber Eras did the moment Nous had foreseen arrive and allow her to succeeded. Despite the efforts made by HooH the Equilibrium and Mythus the Enigmata to challenge Nous' calculations and alter its fate, all that changed was the angle at which Polka's scalpel pierced Rubert's chest. As the third moment occurred, Emperor Rubert I's gargantuan body collapsed along with its empire. Its death marked the end of the First Mechanical Emperor's War and fulfilled the Finality's predictions. In the aftermath of the war, rumors spread that Rubert was either taken out by Polka Kakamond or an assassin hired by the Interastral Peace Corporation, but both may have been true. It was later revealed that the co-founder of the Corporation Dongfang Qixing had associated himself with Polka Kakamond, leveraging her political influence and keeping the war in control with omens, possibly relating to the Finality. Second Mechanical Emperor's War. Many years following the death of Rubert I and the end of the First Emperor's War, a human visited its grave and solved the Anti-Organic Equation during his stay. Despite successfully deriving the solution thousands of times, he refused to speak of its answer, well aware of the consequences should the equation be activated. As a result, his achievement was met with doubt and he remained just as impoverish as before he set off. Soon after his return, he found himself plagued by increasingly negative thoughts, which not only affected his mind but also manifest physically in his limbs and torso. Suddenly, it occurred to him that all organic lives were machines made for deceptive purposes, while he was the only being with free will. In a morose declaration, he resolved that he would carry on Rubert I's will to eradicate all organic lives from the cosmos. Although it's likely that this man was Rubert II, who professed to have inherited the memories of Rubert I and initiated the second Emperor's War, Ruan Mei claimed that it's impossible for Rubert II to exist during the First Emperor's War, as it occurred far too long ago. Not much is known of the Second Emperor's War onwards. Aftermath. During the first war, the inhabitants of Adlivun were left devastated by the Machine Empire before it entered in another struggle with the remnants of The Swarm. The destruction brought by both conflicts led to the ascension of Nanook as an Aeon. Many antiques of high value were also destroyed, such as the Last Phonograph of Order created by Beyond the Sky Choir. After the Second Rubert Rebellion, the IPC invested vast amounts of credits to repeatedly investigate the remains of Rubert II. To their surprise, Rubert II was found to be an organic being. The comparable damage inflicted by these two wars to that of the Swarm Disaster prompted the IPC to consider the extermination of all mechanical life forms across the cosmos. However, before the plan was passed, the they heard that Screwllum, a mechanical life-form, was selected by Nous to join the Genius Society as member #76. They gifted Screwllum the Mechanical Cuckoo Clock as a symbol of peace. Screwllum actively opposes Rubert, and continues to do so today."}

The most iconic ballad of Mendasia is the Song of Beauty. Mendasian music is a departure from the conventional aesthetic however. History. Since the dawn of civilization, Mendasia has believed in the Beauty. Idrila bestowed upon them the Wall of Mirrors that shielded them from plagues. Henceforth, the world concealed its traces in the cosmos, and only a few knew of its existence. Gradually, it became a peaceful wonderland where people indulged in feasts and drinks in the forest of flowers, explored and sang in praise of the Beauty, referring to their homeland as the planet of canticles. However, as the Beauty disappeared, the blessings she left behind gradually crumbled. Approximately two Amber Eras ago, the Wall of Mirrors collapsed entirely, and soon after, Mendasia was swallowed by a terrifying interstellar beast. The surviving Mendasians have been wandering ever since, and no one believes in the paradise spoken of by those refugees. Only a few musical pieces, known as the \"Song of Beauty,\" serve as evidence of the existence of the planet of canticles. Xipe the Harmony and The Family opened their arms for the people. Due to the Iris Family's effort, the remaining residents of the planet of canticles arrived in Penacony.

By now, you should have received the \"Heating Maintenance Safety Operation Manual\". Make sure you read that first. As you are well aware, my wife is about to give birth, so I will be heading home earlier today. I'll be gone for half a month, which means I won't be here for the big maintenance before the Solwarm Festival. But relax, Bel will walk you through everything. Just don't forget what I taught you and you'll be fine. I know you pick up on things fast. However, the maintenance of heating pipes is the most important maintenance job in Belobog. I've made some notes here, in case you forgot. While your read this, open your safety operation manual and follow along. Remember to ask Bel if you have any questions. I won't go over the first and second points because there's nothing to say about getting the certificate and wearing protection. Those are too basic. For the third point, check the lighting for the heating maintenance area. You should pay special attention, especially to the emergency lighting. There was an accident in the past with my master where the furnace wasn't lit. Not lighting is a recipe for accidents. The fourth point on changing the pipes' protecting coating has one missing point at the top, remember to ALWAYS wear insulation gloves. The pipes are full of hot steam and there's no insulation around them. One touch and you will be scalded. I have taught you the ratio to mic the protective coating liquid and water, so be careful. It doesn't matter if you waste some coating liquid, just don't add too much water! The pipes' surface temperature is very high so if you brush a very watery liquid onto it, the room will fill with water vapor. If something goes wrong, it can be fatal. As for how to apply the coating, you already know this. Brush it thinly and evenly, don't go back and forth. The eighth point goes over the most important thing \u2014 maintenance of the steam turbine rotor. Halfway through the maintenance, be sure to check your maintenance clothes' electrical insulation and protective goggles. Also, when going back for maintenance, please remember to stop the boiler and generator. This is a delicate device and if it breaks, there's no replacing it for a while. You can't be too careful with it. For the tenth point, the alarms and monitoring devices we use now are different from the ones in the manual. Just go with what I taught you. That's about it. Once the heating maintenance is complete, you'll be a full-fledged maintenance worker. Come by during the Solwarm Festival and I'll treat you to a special suncake. It's more delicious than anything you'll find in the stores. Also, my wife's relatives are coming over, so try to dress up a bit."}

Your Highness, The clamor of battle has abated, yet much remains, awaiting in disrepair. We are grateful for you constant protection, ensuring that all above and below do not falter. We cannot express our appreciation enough for watchful eye and steadfast care. Criminals exiled, secret arts lost, lineage broken, and generations of knowledge wasted. We have no choice but to entrust that young girl to your esteemed commission in pursuit of knowledge. This is our sincerest intent. Though young and not chosen by selection, she possesses remarkable potential. Placing her under your tutelage will facilitate careful observation and documentation of her growth. We hope that with time and guidance, she may become a powerful support for you. Your esteemed commission has inherited and undertaken a great legacy. Regrettably, the present times are perilous, and the scepter of power has fallen aside. Though possessing the talent to change the tide, the opportunity to do so was not present. Now that the obstacles have been removed, that opportunity has arrived, we have faith that you can revive what has been lost and reverse the course of events! With this letter, I send a servant to deliver ten samples for your experimentation. May the tidings of good fortune arrive swiftly. Also, I understand that it may be difficult for us to communicate via letters. However, this old-fashioned method is more secure and reliable, as there is no fear of surveillance. Once the letter is received, you may find a trusted individual to read it aloud to you. I greatly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Your Obedient Servant, Gouchen Dear Gouchen, I have received the samples that were sent. However after transplanting and cultivating them, all the samples turned to powder. It is likely that they were constantly constrained by the waters of the ancient sea, causing them to lose their vitality upon separation from their original body. After all, both the samples and the ancient waters are mystical celestial traces and are elusive to comprehension. However, I have already devised a plan to solve this mystery. I shall search the Elixir Research Terrace for ancient prescriptions and techniques, or seek the help of skilled individuals from beyond our borders. To this end, I have met with the messenger. She has agreed to provide me with what I desire. Once the Seed is found, she will send someone to deliver it to the Xianzhou. I am not sure how she plans to accomplish this, but it was a condition of our agreement, so I shall wait and see. As for the girl, she has learned quite well under the supervision of my predecessor, but she lacks sufficient experience and tends to be overly rebellious. The servant you sent must watch her every move. There is no need to worry, as she is not likely to break free from our control in the foreseeable future. There is no need to send new samples after receiving this reply. Back then, we unintentionally created the miracle of Bloomborn Scion, but there is a limit to mere luck. Until I make further progress in my research, such a miracle is unlikely to occur again. What we are trying to achieve is difficult. It could change the fate of countless people and even lead us to disaster. However, if we succeed, we will no longer be trapped in the predicament that has plagued us for thousands of years."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=14888","text":"Undestroyed Notes Undestroyed Notes is a readable located on the Xianzhou Luofu. Text. Beyond the Cloud Knights, the existence of the Ten-Lords Commission has always been great concern before taking any action. Although everyone on Xianzhou knows the name of the Ten-Lords Commission, no one knows where its base is, who controls it, or how many members it has. Even though there are written records like the \"Ten-Lords Commission's Book of Imprisonment\" that can be consulted, ordinary people might not even know that this office is not included in the Six Commissions. An opponent who opened bears arms can be guarded against. However, an opponent like the Ten-Lords Commission, who seems familiar but is actually mostly unknown, is truly terrifying. Its nebulous status proves that its members blur people's cognition of them further using some unknown means. I must ascertain the details before taking further action... but unfortunately, time is running out. Spiritfarer Rumor has it that, before the people of the Xianzhou fall into mara, the spiritfarers would come to guide them. Such rumors have always portrayed them as messengers of death with the ability to foresee the future and always appearing at the right time, but this is entirely groundless. The large number of mara-struck victims that I witnessed testified for, and even dissected, proves that even the spiritfarers are powerless to deal with this phenomenon. It is only when it comes to collecting the remains and determining the cause of death that all the documents and research results disappear without a trace, as if swallowed by an invisible black mouth. Who are the spiritfarers? Where are they recruited from? What is their salary? Are they flesh and blood, or ingenium marionettes? Will they also be afflicted with mara like all Xianzhou natives? There are no answers. Judge As the saying goes, \"Better to lose gold and jade than to enter the Shackling Prison. Better to suffer disaster than to face a judge.\" When a judge appears, the cycranes all malfunction and ignore commands, so none can capture their image. But I have collected many more eyewitness accounts of the judges than of the spiritfarers. Perhaps their appearance signifies that things have deteriorated to an irreparable point, and their commotion and traces are so conspicuous that they cannot be concealed. According to reliable eyewitness accounts, the judges are responsible for capturing, subduing \u2013 and when necessary, killing \u2013 the long-life species that violate the Ten Unpardonable Sins in the \"Xianzhou Legal Code\". Such targets are extremely dangerous, so the judges possess incredible instruments of punishment and sorcery, far superior to the Cloud Knights' weapons and armor. A sister among the disciples once described to me one of the judge's brushes \u2013 it could write talismans out of thin air, which would make the written come true. Everyone claims that the Cloud Knights are the backbone of the Xianzhou's protection. In my opinion, that is just a front. The judges have far greater authority and power. As our brethren move deeper, the judges will surely try to obstruct them. If, regardless of cost, we can capture or dispose of one of them study their instruments, we may gain a deeper understanding of the Ten-Lords Commission. The Shackling Prison Committing any of the Ten Unpardonable Sins means becoming an enemy of the Xianzhou. It is believed that those who do so will be imprisoned in the bottomless dungeon called Shackling Prison by the Ten-Lords Commission. Some say the Shackling Prison is located at the bottom of the Xianzhou, in a vacuum where temperatures are near Absolute Zero. Some say the Ten-Lords Commission strings the dungeon delves together like beads and carries them under strict supervision by the judges, Others believe that the Shackling Prison is one of the six Xianzhou ships, dedicated to permanently suppressing prisoners. As for the types of prisoners being held, the information begins to become mysteriously muddied. Speculations abound in tales of extraplanar beings fiercely repressed by the judges, indestructible long-life abominations, ancient aurumatons who can overturn the Xianzhou, or even Denizens of Abundance who once fought bloodily against the Xianzhou \u2013 it's almost an encyclopedia of conspiracies. These tales are bizarre and none of them should be believed. The only common thread among all the tales is that the Shackling Prison houses extremely dangerous prisoners. This makes one wonder if one could use the prisoners as weapons against the Ten-Lords Commission, if the entrance to the Shackling Prison could be found... This is not just a whimsical idea, but a feasible one. For in the near future, I will fix my regrets and witness the return of celestial traces. Those great evils will also become ants under my control."}

Part I. \"*The ancient paper the letter was written on was already thin as a butterfly's wings, ready to crumble into dust at the slightest touch.*\" Mom:By the time you receive this letter, the gifts I asked Betty to take home should also have arrived. I'm afraid I can't come back to celebrate your birthday this year. The work here at the army is just too much, and I can't take a holiday. However, rest assured. We are pretty far from the front line, so we are quite safe. The Supreme Guardian herself has also been here commanding the troops for the past few months. Everyone is working at their posts, so I can't really sneak off on my own. Mom, I'm dreaming a lot about when I was just a child. I remember how I complained you always came off work so late and didn't pay any attention to our family. What did you say to me then? You said \"It is my responsibility,\" but I didn't understand it. Now, Belobog is facing a crisis that is growing more and more dire, and I finally understood the responsibility an \"Architect\" should carry. As the war worsened, I actually join an unannounced big project recently. Sorry, Mom, I can't tell you what it is even though you work for the design institute. I can only say it involves the most majestic creation of the Architects that I have ever seen. I'm lucky as it is to be a part of the team. Wow, I never thought there'd be a day when I'd feel so proud of my job... I wish you could see it in action. I swear any enemy would be stricken by paralyzing fear by the mere sight of it. However, the Supreme Guardian said this creation would only be activated if Belobog stands at the brink of destruction. In that case, I wish you never get to know what we're making. Anyways, let's talk about something else \u2014 The command center was completed last month and our goods were gradually being moved in. I put a pot of solarflower on my desk and it's growing pretty well. Every time I looked at it, I'd think about the flowers in our living room. How are they doing? You also liked to knit while sitting next to the window. Do you still do that, now the Eternal Freeze is getting worse? The gift I asked Betty take back is to protect your knees. You always said your knees hurt in cold weather. I know a few Silvermanes here who just got back from their mission, and they got some wolf manes made into a knee pad. Please remember to use them. Lastly, this might be a bit late, but I still want to say \u2014 Happy Birthday, Mom.Love, Lana Part II. \"*The ancient paper the letter was written on was already thin as a butterfly's wings, ready to crumble into dust at the slightest touch.*\" Betty: I got Larry to make a wolf mane knee pad. Do remember to go to his house and get it off him. He hurt his leg and can't go to the front lines anymore. Remember to take some gifts with you when you go, and remember to say thank you to him! Don't act like we have no manners in this family. I won't be able to come back for a long time. I was checking the fortifications in the trenches a few days ago and got injured. It's not a big deal, so don't tell Mom just yet. I don't want her to overthink things. I told her that I've been in the Command Center all this time. I was so busy for the past while, and only got around to writing to you now I'm resting around the Command Center. Annie talked to me about how you've been lately. You are really doing so well. You stayed home to look after Mom and are managing your studies at the same time. That really is a lot of responsibility. As your older sister, I'm so sorry that I can't look after you when you need it most. I've seen so much death out here, so for the past while I've been thinking... well, it's not impossible that I might pass away myself. If that does happen, then our family is in your hands. Look after Mom and yourself. I left some money in the house with my savings from my previous job. I hid it in your wardrobe in THAT spot \u2014 You know what I'm talking about. Don't be too hard on yourself if you want to buy something. I trust that you won't waste the money. Although I feel like I don't need to nag you again, but Betty, please don't get upset with Mom. She is just that kind of person, right? Just give in to her a little. Also, there's something I never told you, haha. You see, I always felt you are my cutest and loveliest little sister, forever and ever.Your most beautiful and charming older sisterLana"}

He was originally an Overworld doctor, but descended to the Underworld to attempt to develop a medicine he labelled \"Blizzard Immunity.\" Story. Vache came from a prominent medical family, and graduated from Belobog's medical school with ease. Natasha described him as gentle and introverted, but absurdly obsessive when it came to his work. He became obsessed with developing Blizzard Immunity, a medicine that would steel the human body against the cold so the people of Belobog could survive the Eternal Freeze. Vache came to the Underworld under the guise of helping Natasha with her clinic, although his true intentions were to find test subjects that he could not procure in the Overworld. He discovered that people in the Underworld who were affected by Fragmentum corrosion had different reactions to hot and cold and began selling his experimental solutions as wonder cures to test their effects on people. The medicine gave them false hope but did nothing for their actual ailments, which led to many deaths. When his actions came to light, Oleg and Natasha exiled Vache from the Underworld, rather than risk lynching if his actions were publicized. He asked to be taken outside the city to the Outlying Snow Plains, and disappeared into the snow. Vache continued to work on Blizzard Immunity even after being exiled, and eventually developed a version of the medicine with no side effects that would be used by the Silvermane Guards patrolling the snow plains. The guards eventually lost contact with Vache. When Natasha discovered this a few years later, she presumed him dead and built a grave for him near his last abandoned lab."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6474","text":"Vache's Letter Vache's Letter is a readable found in Jarilo-VI. It is automatically acquired during Blizzard Immunity. Text. Natasha: How have you been? I hope you are doing well. I am, as I stated in my previous letter, envious of you. You always show unwavering kindness to your patients... I'm envious of your inherent compassion. I remember giving a speech on stage when I first started school, waving my arms, and advocating for the development of \"Blizzard Immunity.\" In hindsight, I was a fool. During my final days of medical school, I became increasingly stubborn and withdrew into myself. Experiments and ambitions consumed my heart, and the patients who were supposed to be in my care were progressively ignored... Natasha, I dare not beg your forgiveness. I owe the people of the Underworld too much already. I might have spent the rest of my life as a madman wallowing in my convictions if you hadn't agreed to my desire for self-exile. The cold has revealed to me my arrogance. How can a child who grew up in warmth ever begin to comprehend a cure to bitter cold? Thank you for giving me one last chance to discover the answer. I live in abandoned houses under broken roofs and continue my experiments. One step after another, I've made breakthroughs. I'm trembling, not because of the cold... but because I can feel I'm getting closer to the answer I seek... I'd become a pariah, unable to return to civilized society nor to face my parents... but I didn't despair, because I'd discovered the meaning of my existence. I had a feeling I was on the right track. The reagents I developed in the Underworld have a serious flaw: the medication only addresses the issue of organ hypothermia and failure, and it will be caught in a never-ending vicious cycle of consumption and recovery. I should have changed the focus of my study a long time ago and tried to figure out how to raise the temperature of the organs and of the body in a controlled manner. Natasha, thank you very much. You helped me find the missing piece in the development of Blizzard Immunity."}

While we sleep in the warmth of our Geomarrow Furnaces, the drawn-out war never ceases! As we all know, the calamity we call the Fragmentum had been expanding in the last few centuries. And now, the Fragmentum and monsters it breeds are showing their fangs as the corrosion continues to worsen at an unprecedented rate. We once obtained a total victory in the War of Defense, and likewise we shall not bow to the strife of the war against Fragmentum monsters! While the valor of the Silvermane Guards is unparalleled by any other, the viciousness of the Fragmentum monsters has also been increasing with each passing day. Under the protection of the Architects, the Silvermane Guards continue to push back the monsters as news of good tidings keeps rolling back from the frontline. Our great guardian, Madam Cocolia, keenly noticed that the time for counterattack has come! The Rivet Town Administrative Committee and the Chamber of Commerce hereby announce the supreme guardian's decree: From this day on, both armies of the Overworld and Underworld shall assemble and move toward the Fragmentum in the Overworld! At this time, if we are able to concentrate the strength of our entire army, we can with most certainty end this nefarious war! Our heroic people will once again enjoy a great victory!

May the heroic people of Belobog stand forever with their great city in the face of the freeze! \"(Under the dated mobilization order is some disgruntled graffiti.)\" How many years has it been, and our forces are still on the counteroffensive?

They are primarily found within the Xianzhou Alliance. Description. Biology. A Vidyadhara's most telling and distinctive feature is their pointed, sharp ears. A long-life species, Vidyadhara molt after living for six or seven hundred years, repairing their bodies, then hatching anew from pearl-like eggs with their past memories gone. Injuries may also prematurely trigger the process of hatching rebirth. Vidyadhara typically go to Scalegorge Waterscape for the self-reincarnating process. There, Vidyadhara Pearlkeepers will assist and protect their newly-reborn kin. Pearlkeeper teams may have members that specialize in combat, cloudhymn, and egg-nurturing. The Xianzhou Fanghu occasionally sends inspectors to check on the condition of Scalegorge Waterscape. Once born, a teacher is assigned to instruct young Vidyadhara in the art of cloudhymn and various life skills. There may be certain disorders or diseases that affect the hatching rebirth cycle, such as Jinyu's condition, which causes her growth to be a hundred times faster than a normal Vidyadhara and undergoes her cycle of hatching rebirth every few months. Bailu states that this is an extremely rare, one-in-a-million condition that she is unfortunately unable to treat. Another such condition is Everdream Syndrome, which is caused by inefficient energy conversion during the hatching rebirth period. This syndrome once caused a female Vidyadhara patient to enter a comatose state for 100 to 150 years after her hatching rebirth, requiring her to take lifelong qi-supplementing medication. Only upon her next hatching rebirth could the results of the treatment be observed. The actor Shiyun mentions being unable to grow past a child form, possibly meaning he possesses a similar, though inverted, condition to Jinyu. It is possible that Vidyadhara may be born any sex regardless of whether their previous incarnation was male or female. Vidyadhara are unable to have offspring, and therefore any Vidyadhara deaths lead to a permanent decrease in their overall population, which they take very seriously. However, this also means the Sky-Faring Commission's travel reviewers are fairly lenient on them, which allows Vidyadhara many opportunities to travel to other worlds compared to the other two long-life races, as they cannot uncontrollably propagate like Xianzhou Natives and Foxians might. Their life cycle relies upon continuous cellular transdifferentiation. This is the reason why Vidyadharas do not face the ailments of immortality, namely mara, that many other long-life species have to contend with. Some Vidyadhara like Ling Jie or the Sad Woman leave diaries, information, or heirlooms for their next incarnations to inherit, while others like Jinyu prefer not to. Vidyadhara who wish to leave personal belongings for their next incarnation can do so with hatching rebirth managers like Lingling. However, many newly reborn Vidyadhara are unable to identify sentimental items belonging to their past selves, and any discarded items are often resold as trinkets. Abilities. The Vidyadhara are capable of an art known as cloudhymn magic or cloudcry magic, which takes painstaking practice to use, though High Elders have a notable talent for it, with the Imbibitor Lunae being able to create tidal waves, water spouts, rain, water spears, and even parting the seas at Scalegorge Waterscape on several occasions. It appears to be hydrokinetic in nature and has multiple applications. Cloudhymn can be used in acrobatic performance art, but has little astonishing effect on crowds, as these tricks are known to be endemic to the Vidyadhara. It also has practical combat applications, and a number of Vidyadhara are trained in it, especially Pearlkeepers and Cloudhymn Magi. It is implied that cloudhymn magi from the Fanghu's Ebony Pearl Orbit would have been sufficient to stop Thalassa's Devil Tide. Cloudhymn magic can be used to create illusions through optical refraction, and make the user and their surroundings practically invisible. Counter to this, mirage echolocation can be used to detect such illusions by centering and transmitting mirage echoes. Mirage echoes are memories of past lives and echoes of the past that Vidyadhara shed during their rebirth. They can be conversed with, though they tend to only talk to people they recognize. It is said that the water on their bodies can be used as medicine. Cloudhymn can also be used to heal, as demonstrated by Dan Feng and Bailu. Other applications of cloudhymn also include the ability to float and project holographic images. Cloudhymn magic can also be applied industrially to mechanisms such as the elixir crucibles. The power to turn into dragons was a rare inheritance passed down only to those who could successfully complete numerous rites and challenges. Those that do develop more draconic features such as horns and a tail, and are generally referred to as High Elders. Young High Elders are guided, advised, and educated by Preceptors. At some point in their lives, High Elders will receive the \"Orb of Abysm\" and the \"Transmutation Arcanum,\" which should enable them to re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives in dreams. The Office of Deep Sources is charged with transcribing, retelling, and annotating these dreams, and their files run to an enormous number of volumes. Although such dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand or interpret, it is the only way the Vidyadhara believe they have of coming close to the Permanence. To take the throne, the High Elder of the Vidyadhara needs to pass a series of trials during which their physical features slowly transform to resemble that of their predecessors. The Transmutation Arcanum is said to contain a secret that allows the Vidyadhara to escape the cycle of reincarnation and return to normal reproduction, but the mechanism to this is unknown. The secret of Vidyadhara reproduction may entail the incorporation of other races into their species. It was once believed that all Vidyadhara had the power of transmutation gifted to them by Long to change the form of any creature as easily as children playing with modeling clay; for example, if a sea beast was too small to be eaten, they'd fatten it up and make it proliferate. However, they eventually lost this ability, and the other species in their homeworld turned hostile against them and they were forced to flee. The Vidyadhara are also said to have always observed the law of natural flow. They believe all creatures are connected to one another, and that life is everlasting in its cycle. Culture. Politics. The individual Vidyadhara population on each Xianzhou ship is lead by a respective High Elder who is responsible for the wellbeing of their people. In the case where the High Elder cannot lead, the Council of Preceptors assumes governance in their place. The High Elder has the power to affect Preceptor assignments. Likewise, the Preceptors have the power to strip the current High Elder of their name and power and elect a new one in their place should the circumstances deem fit to do so. The High Elder selection tradition had already existed before the Vidyadhara migrated to the Xianzhou. The Xianzhou Fanghu is an autonomous dominion of the Vidyadhara, and thusly has different customs, culture, and social structures from other Xianzhou ships. Glaciator Marum, High Elder of the Fanghu, governs over all citizens, and the Six Charioteers and Six Commissions support the High Elder. It is because of their influence that the Pearlkeepers aboard the Fanghu formed an elite force that have basically replaced the role of the Cloud Knights there. Pearlkeepers are trained in cloudhymn and combat, their signature weapons being tidal tridents. Vidyadhara on the Fanghu enjoy a number of welfare benefits compared to other Xianzhou ships. For example, on the Fanghu, upon completing their hatching rebirth, the newborn Vidyadhara is immediately assigned a new residence without having to go through the standard real estate paperwork, which is an inconvenience to Vidyadhara who cannot keep track of their past lives. Additionally, it is said the water quality on the Fanghu is better than other Xianzhou ships. Industry. The Vidyadhara have made great advancements in medicine. Liu Hua, a Vidyadhara Pearlkeeper that supported Glaciator Marum for the first three hundred years of his life and became the head healer that closely served him for the last four hundred, wrote a book that is widely recognized as the foundation of the Xianzhou Alliance's modern medicine. Through his long years of clinical practice and research, Liu Hua had acutely realized the Xianzhou medical science's problem at that time: the Xianzhou's tradition of preserving the past meant significant amounts of medical practice relied on experience instead of science. Liu Hua therefore authored \"Liu Hua's Medical Compendium\" in the hopes of re-organizing and better explaining the principles of Xianzhou medical science using more scientific methods of inquiry. Specially-made Vidyadhara medicine or medicinal herbs can be found in Scalegorge Waterscape or the Alchemy Commissions, which include Draconic Tears, Tian Dong, Dragon Scale Coral, and cyan poria. The Alchemy Commissions of the Luofu and Fanghu have a Dragon Tree and Dragon Scale Coral Statue respectively, symbolizing the Vidyadhara's deep connection with Xianzhou medical practices. \"Injection of Past Life in Dreams\" is a Vidyadhara prescription that, when ingested after their hatching rebirth, allows Vidyadhara to remember their past life. Clinical evidence shows this prescription should be used within the first five years after hatching rebirth. Administered via golden needle injection, the patient will be able to regain memories of their previous life via dreams. However, the quantity and level of clarity of these memories are unable to be controlled. According to Vidyadhara legends, this prescription was made by the alchemist Qinglu for their lover. Qinglu did not want their relationship to be over and wanted to continue it in their next reincarnation. This prescription goes against the cultural traditions and laws of the Vidyadhara, and was deemed not be used except when the very survival of the Vidyadhara race is at risk. It is an offense against the laws of the Vidyadhara to use the injection of past life in dreams on a Vidyadhara against their will, through coercion, or by force. Any offenders would suffer the punishment of forced rebirth. \"The General's Di Huang Drink\" is a medicinal pellet for Vidyadhara that do not grow past their infantile stage and suffer from delayed development. This medication is still under clinical trial. If no results emerge after a year, the prescription is to be considered invalid and abandoned. One of the ingredients, Bigger-Faster, is a combination medication from various different plants. Though there are no toxic side effects, it is strictly forbidden to widely apply this medication before Lady Bailu confirms its efficacy. Longevity Hall is an apothecary owned by Little Tian that sells medicines licensed by the Alchemy Commission. While the Vidyadhara are known for their unique medical treatment that can only be provided by their race, they also appear to have very capable craftsmen. Cloud Knight Lieutenant Yanqing once asked the Trailblazer to help him decide between purchasing two swords from the Artisanship Commission, one of them of Vidyadhara make, forged with the exotic corallium metal of Scalegorge Waterscape and tempered with thaumaspring water. The Passerby's Roaming Dragon Bracers were made from flowing coral gold and the leather of unknown beasts, and it was said that only master artisans from the Vidyadhara dragon race could create this kind of superior armor. Yunyou, attendant to the young High Elder, Bailu, commissioned some of the finest craftsmen to create the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle the latter's tail in order to prevent a loss of control over her powers. Dracocatena Nails being staked into his body and chains of corallium were used to contain Dan Feng, Imbibitor Lunae of the Luofu, inside the Shackling Prison. Ardens Regia, the High Elder of the Xianzhou Zhuming, once sent a Vidyadhara craftsman to the Luofu to teach the masters of the Luofu Artisanship Commission about craftsmanship. The craftsman then started their hatching rebirth with the intent to pass back their improved knowledge back to the Zhuming after their rebirth. Entertainment. Vidyadhara elegies are the traditional music of the Vidyadhara people. The Vidyadhara use only simple castanets for musical instruments, relying on extremely diverse sets of melodies. Originating from their folk songs, the style is generally that of mournful dirges. Vidyadhara elegies can be said to represent all of the most tragic aspects of Xianzhou culture, as Vidyadhara players tend to sing about loves lost and pyrrhic victories. Vidyadhara elegies suit a tragic tone, and they only have a handful of happy endings, as they originate from an era of great unrest and turmoil for them. Most performances leave listeners with a bitter-sweet taste. Several hundred years ago, there was a Vidyadhara player named Ling Jie who sang two operas which went sensationally viral aboard the Xianzhou Luofu: \"Dragontooth Tales\" and \"Fateful Rebirth.\" The Vidyadhara also have a presence in the immersia industry. Yong Zheng, a Vidyadhara, was known as one of the greatest directors in the history of Butterfly Immersia with his well-known immersias being: \"\", \"Luofu Monster\", \"Heliobus Ingenia\", and \"Xianzhou Predator\". He was said to be one of the pioneers of the evil beast genre. All of Yong Zheng's works in his creative career are from a Vidyadhara's perspective. As for cuisine, there are a few Vidyadhara-owned restaurants: Dragon Palace's Kitchen on the Xianzhou Zhuming, and Spices Supreme and Delicacy Pavilion on the Xianzhou Luofu. The former is the only Interastral Gourmet Association-rated five star restaurant among the Xianzhou ships, and is known for being expensive while serving small portions. However, Spices Supreme was opened with the opposite dining philosophy in mind, serving big portions with quality food, and at low prices. Delicacy Pavilion is another established Vidyadhara-owned restaurant in Aurum Alley on the Luofu. History. The Vidyadhara originated from a region in the waters of the Ancient Sea known as the Roiling Deep on an unnamed ocean world. It was said that back then, they could use their powers derived from Long to change the form of any creature, as easily as children playing with modeling clay. One day, when they could no longer control the powers of their dragon ancestor, all of the creatures in the entire ocean became deadly towards them. The fish were toxic, the sea beasts hostile, and even the aquatic plant-life could prey on them. Eventually, even the micro-organisms in the Roiling Deep became dangerous. They multiplied until the oceans were no longer fit for their survival. Later on, they became a major member race of the Xianzhou Alliance, and the entire delve of Scalegorge Waterscape on the Luofu was said to have been brought over from their homeworld, including the waters of the Lunarescent Depths. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing: \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara, and the five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, High Elder of the Luofu at the time, made a decision to move the entire delve of Scalegorge Waterscape underwater to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor. The statue at Dragonvista Rain Hall was erected in honor of this. As a reward, the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Xianzhou Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship. At some point, the previous Caelorum Venti fought valiantly and slew a herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. The Caelorum Venti Pavilion in was built in the Moon Delve of the Xianzhou Yaoqing to commemerate this, with 3000 Vidyadhara craftsmen working over 20 years to build the pavilion with large slabs of jade and moonstone. Dan Feng, the previous Imbibitor Lunae, was a member of the High-Cloud Quintet. Their group accomplished many feats such as driving out the borisin invading Thalassa, destroying the alliance between the Houyhnhnms and the wingweavers in the Abundance Axis, rescuing the Xianzhou Yuque, and defeating the living planet Ketu Mirage. He became one of the most prolific Vidyadhara of his time. However, approximately a hundred years later, the High-Cloud Quintet fell apart. The Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae. Sometime after, in the Year 7379 Star Calender, Dan Feng went on to commit a great crime by tampering with the Transmutation Arcanum. His actions were described as \"embracing immorality and breaking the ban, thieving immortality and inciting riot.\" Dan Feng had two goals in mind when making changes to the Transmutation Arcanum: he attempted to use its power, combined with Shuhu's flesh, to resurrect his fallen friend Baiheng, and also allowed other species to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara, giving the Vidyadhara the possibility of replenishing their population. However, this instead resulted in the creation of a draconic abomination that wreaked great destruction on Scalegorge Waterscape, which the remaining members of the Quintet were forced to put down, resulting in damage to the seals, 12 Preceptors, 253 Pearlkeepers, and 116 alchemists and healers being wounded. 1285 Vidyadhara completely perished in this disaster, and over 3000 were still missing at the time of the incident. This incident would come to be known as the \"Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.\" Bailu's instatement as Dan Feng's successor as High Elder and the dragon heart going missing were direct consequences of the event. This event sparked widespread turmoil, and was considered an act of rebellion against the Xianzhou Luofu and a stain on Vidyadhara history. The Luofu Vidyadhara were greatly divided on the matter; there were those who sided with Dan Feng and those who sided with the Xianzhou. It was a controversial time of great unrest. The Cloud Knights joined forces with the Vidyadhara Preceptors to arrest Dan Feng. His punishment, a forced hatching rebirth, was carried out, and his subsequent incarnation was held in the Shackling Prison for a period of time before being exiled from the Luofu, which went against the agreement between the Alliance and Caelorum Venti. Sometime after, Lady Bailu was selected to become the next Imbibitor Lunae, though she did not possess the same level of power as previous High Elders, and the power of dragon transmutation was not passed on intact, as the Transmutation Arcanum may not have been carried out in full. Caelorum Venti sent a missive to the Luofu Preceptors inquiring about her condition. After Dan Feng's imprisonment and rebirth, several Vidyadhara still supported and worshipped him in secret, writing several literary works and dramas about the Sedition of the Imbibitor Lunae from the perspective of supporters, which caused groups to form that stood against the Alliance. On the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of Ketu Mirage, and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight, but they were still facing defeat. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow. Nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed as a result of collateral damage. Ever since the third Abundance War, the Fanghu had adopted self-preservation policies to recuperate. As a result, they had had cut off most of their regular communications and trade with the other Xianzhou ships, a decision from the Glaciator Marum, the Fanghu's High Elder, implicitly stemming from the Vidyadhara's inability to produce offspring. Stellaron Crisis. Sometime around March 18, 8100 Star Calendar, High Elder Bailu escaped the Alchemy Commission with help of Banxia. Around the same time period, the Astral Express Crew arrived on board the Xianzhou Luofu due to a warning from the Stellaron Hunters about the upcoming Stellaron crisis. They were followed by Dan Heng, the banished reincarnation of Dan Feng, who was worried for the safety of his companions. Shortly afterward, the Stellaron crisis began as the Ambrosial Arbor was resurrected with power of the Stellaron. Bailu met the Express crew in the Exalting Sanctum after they saved her from rampant mara-struck monsters. After meeting the Trailblazer again, Bailu discovered that Banxia was a former member of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, but still upheld her agreement to help heal her beloved, Liangmu, after finding him. Though eventually becoming mara-struck, Banxia managed to meet with Liangmu for a brief moment before he ran away in fear and she succumbed to the mara. After putting her to rest, Bailu and the Trailblazer found Liangmu in order to heal him. Bailu then decided to lay low in Central Starskiff Haven for awhile before returning to Exalting Sanctum, and eventually, the Alchemy Commission. Meanwhile, Dan Heng was proceeding towards the Alchemy Commission along with Cloud Knight Sushang and traveling merchant Luocha, whom he met along the way. After reaching the Healer's Market, he parted ways with the two, slipped away from the Cloud Knight safe zone, and took a boat to Dragonprayer Terrace. There, he was confronted by Blade, who was accompanied by Kafka. As the two fought, Yanqing, a Cloud Knight Lieutenant who had been tracking Blade and followed Dan Heng from the Alchemy Commission, intervened. Blade still managed to land a serious blow to Dan Heng, which triggered the reveal of his Vidyadhara form. Yanqing decided to fight both of them at once as they were both criminals, but was soon defeated, with Kafka using her Spirit Whisper to break up the fight before Jing Yuan stepped in. The General let the Stellaron Hunters leave, then coaxed his old friend's reincarnation into joining him at Dragonvista Rain Hall at Scalegorge Waterscape, citing that his friends from the Express were there. After reuniting with the Express Crew and fighting the Antimatter Legion, where Lord Ravager Phantylia was revealed to have masterminded the Stellaron crisis, Dan Heng parted the Ancient Seas of Scalegorge Waterscape leading to the roots of the Arbor. A party consisting of Dan Heng, Jing Yuan, and the Express crew headed into the Lunarescent Depths to undo the already-weakened seals to the Arbor, allowing them passage to Phantylia, who created a new body using the power of Abundance. There, they fought a tough battle, but eventually defeated the Lord Ravager. Jing Yuan was seriously injured in the process. After leaving the General to recuperate, Dan Heng and the Express crew witnessed the soul-soothing ceremony for Tingyun before meeting with Jing Yuan, who revoked the banishment decree. They prepared to leave the Luofu, but before they left, Dan Heng expressed his desire to meet the current High Elder of the Luofu, Bailu, and make amends for Dan Feng, starting by repairing the seal at Scalegorge Waterscape. Dan Heng met with Huanxi, one of Bailu's maids, who urged him not to meet her and instead meet with the Preceptor elders in order to take up the position of High Elder, claiming she did not want Bailu to take on the burden. Luying, a Vidyadhara alchemist from the Alchemy Commission, expressed a different sentiment to Dan Heng, fearing that he would threaten Bailu's position as High Elder, and asked him to leave the Luofu as they were making their way to the starskiff dock. At the Alchemy Commission, they came across General Jing Yuan, who was still recuperating. He gave them some advice before they left, where they were set upon by Vidyadhara assassins just as they met with Huanxi at the docks. After Dan Heng swiftly dispatched the assailants, they group made their way to Scalegorge Waterscape where they met Bailu and exchanged pleasantries. Both Dan Heng and Bailu expressed their disinterest in the High Elder position before proceeding down towards the Dragon Palace. There, Dan Heng tried repairing the seal but to no avail. Bailu, following his example, started to affect the seal. By working together and combining their powers, they successfully managed to strengthen the Arbor's seal, proving that Bailu did inherit some of Dan Feng's power through the Transmutation Arcanum. However, they were soon ambushed by more assassins concealed by cloudhymn magic. After they defeated the attackers, they discovered there were more concealed enemies looking for them. Dan Heng used mirage echolocation using the various mirage echoes lingering in the ruined Palace to detect and avoid the assassins. While conversing with the echoes, they learned more about the true nature of Dan Feng's crime. The group managed to reach the surface and met with Huanxi, who declared that she was worried about Bailu, as she had been attacked by assassins. After being questioned about how she knew about the assassins and how they were targeting Bailu, Huanxi revealed herself to be among their ranks and attacked the group with her fellow assassins. In the heat of battle, Jing Yuan joined the fight and assisted them in defeating the remaining assailants. Jing Yuan questions the Preceptors' motives, while Huanxi denied their involvement, insisting that she acted alone. She died before Jing Yuan could bring her in for further questioning. Dan Heng and Bailu reflected on what they learned, Dan Heng observing that while he had inherited Dan Feng's more combat-oriented and destructive abilities, Bailu inherited all of his healing and restorative abilities. Bailu posed that Dan Heng might have been the teacher that had always she needed, and that they might have been friends or disciples in their previous lives. Dan Heng revealed that his worries about Bailu had been assuaged by the Preceptors and that she always possessed true power. Regarding her healing abilities, Bailu assured Dan Heng that Dan Feng might have had a gentle side to him as well, before they both bid each other farewell."}

They are one of the races of the Extraneous Demons. Despite their low intelligence, they are extremely deadly. They attack like a pathogen rather of a sentient enemy. Currently, viscorpi are on the verge of extinction. Description. Viscorpi are a decaying alien civilization that thrive on parasitizing the orifices of primates, such as the nasal cavities, to induce hallucinations. The viscorpus is described as a peculiar creature with a gelatinous texture, with the ability to change its body shape freely to develop organs that can be used as weapons. Being able to traverse in space with its bare body, it is fittingly called a cosmic epidemic. The viscorpus is edible, and one dish made from them is viscorpus sugar balls stir-fried with cured meat. History. The earliest record of the viscorpus can be traced back to the Lone Voyage Era, when the Xianzhou were wandering around in space. The populations of the Xianzhou Daiyu and Xianzhou Yuanqiao once declined drastically due to corrosion of viscorpuses. In 1200 Star Calendar, the Daiyu exploded during the campaign against the viscorpuses. Amid a war against the borisin, the alliance discovered that viscorpuses were once a kind of livestock controlled by the borisin. After the viscorpi mutated out of control, the borisin did nothing to stop the dangerous creatures from ravaging the planets. It took years for the Cloud Knights to eradicate them."}

Its history is referenced in the Planar Ornament set Sprightly Vonwacq. It is currently inaccessible. Description. Vonwacq is a small and crowded planet, almost entirely covered by rainforests and islands, with its exuberant wildlife being its most recognizable feature. Vonwacq's effervescent vitality made the rainforests near its equator grow so large and tall that their shades would cover the sky above and even block out the sun. The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on. Teeming with plant life, Wacq Island was the most well-known island on Planet Vonwacq and is sealed within the plane. On the island was a gigantic tree called Thestang, bearing fruits that would give birth to the various kinds of the island's wildlife. The Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother. The indigenous Wacqwacq beings had always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree. They were a tribal Stone-Age people who were divided into distinctly two tribes. Tingyun claimed that Sandcitrus seeds from the Bitterwater Confederacy that are transplanted into the soils of Vonwacq will grow into sweet oranges. The IPC has a fully-automatic neck-tracking memory-foam pillow, made of natural Vonwacq rubber. History. Every sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a being known as the \"\"Demon King\"\", waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island. One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out. At some point in the past, unknown outsiders visited the planet. At first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit, joining them in their fight. As the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the Demon King \u2014 It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe. When the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed \u2014 the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere. The demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq. Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration. The Nameless once visited the planet during Akivili's time. Yanming, one of the Nameless at the time, trod on some twigs sprouting from the sacred Vonwacq forest. The laws of the forest dictated that any broken twig must be repaid in kind -\u2014 with two broken ribs. Although he soon healed, he claimed the event was psychologically scarring."}

Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq. At first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home. As the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"\"Demon King\"\" \u2014 It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe. When the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed \u2014 the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere. The demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals. The sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence. The coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration."}

Description. The Wastelanders of Talia must wear a mask at all times to protect themselves from the ever-present threats of residual radiation and sandstorms. Nobody knew if any scientific principles were even taken into account when such wild re-modifications of the ventilator mask were made. Perhaps it was all just a placebo effect. \"Haven't you heard? That old fool across the valley plugged water tubes into his mask! I definitely couldn't take that, if it were me.\" The Wastelanders seldom complain about the extremely harsh climate in Talia. For one thing, ever since the nuclear blast filled the atmosphere with sand and dust, nothing could be done about it. Another reason, however, was that when red sand filled the air and blocked out the sun, it provided them with a prime opportunity to ambush the encampments of other bandit groups, as they could put on breathing masks and pop up out of nowhere among the sweeping sandstorms.

The core idea for the so-called \"Sensory Technology\" is \u2014 Don't ask how, don't ask why, nobody cares. \"You attached that piece of junk to me?

Their gut feeling was that the recordings were precious. After hypocritically feigning appreciation, they happily burned those books to ashes, only taking along the robes left by the friars. After all, the other things wouldn't be worth a penny in Nailscrap Town. Most Wastelanders were illiterate. No amount of records of civilization would be more useful to them than a hot meal.

Unfortunately, only the leg part of the first generation of that cheap powered armor has survived. Even after being greatly simplified, the greaves still allow their wearer to take off like a rocket \u2014 a mechanism that confuses engineers nowadays.

Some say he was once a merchant who sold timepieces. There are even those who say his head is shaped like a watch face \u2014 Just like Clockie, which he created.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34688","text":"Watchmaker Investigation Record Watchmaker Investigation Record is a readable found on Penacony. Text. According to historical records preserved in the Moment of Sol, the Watchmaker existed before the establishment of the Family council. He gained support from several influential founding figures in Penacony, including Hanunue and Glaux, and leveraged this advantage to acquire the right to have a say in decisions regarding this world. He therefore achieved greatness and exerted his will in Penacony, ultimately becoming the \"Father of Penacony.\" Despite his esteemed reputation, he has managed to maintain his secrecy through various means. There are over three hundred different types of the Watchmaker's appearances documented in interviews and written records alone. These forms can be categorized into two types. The first type of form is often non-human. He would use unconventional items as media for remote communication, with the Sweet Dreams Troupe, Clockie toys, and cartoon ornaments in the Clock Studios Theme Park being the most common. He assumes such guises in most interactions with his partners and employees. The second type of form is usually an intelligent life form, potentially, potentially being the Watchmaker's true self. This form commonly appears in eyewitness reports and urban legends. Rumors say he often dresses in gorgeous attire and would appear amidst the grandeur of Penacony, attending banquets with successful Dreamchasers. The Bloodhound Family has examined the memories of witnesses and revealed that nearly 6% of the eyewitness reports are genuine. However, it is strange that the Watchmaker appears as a blurred image with a bizarre voice in each memory, with inconsistent details such as body type, appearance, and even gender once these memories have been decoded. We hypothesize that the Watchmaker possesses the ability to conceal his appearance on a memory level, an ability often associated with Enigmata. Therefore, there might be external forces supporting the Watchmaker. While we acknowledge that the Watchmaker's investments in Clock Studios, Clockie Pizza, and Clock Hand Foundation have contributed somewhat to the development of Penacony, we must not overlook the damage the Watchmaker has inflicted upon The Family's interests. The most severe case was the Clock Credit Crisis, which involved a speculative token introduced by the Watchmaker that severely disrupted the Dreamscape's economy. It took the Alfalfa Family decades to eventually resolve the crisis, causing outrageous market disruption unparalleled in several Amber Eras. According to reports from the Alfalfa Family, the Watchmaker has repeatedly employed financial, marketing, investment, and even fraudulent tactics to gain an advantage in emerging markets, encroaching upon The Family's rightful interests. He organizes balls in the Blue Hour to enhance his reputation and continuously expand his influence in society. As a result, many misguided Dreamchasers regard him as their idol, and a considerable number of potential business partners of The Family have been lured towards his enterprises instead. Given the aforementioned circumstances, the Oak Family proposes an investigation into the Watchmaker and his affiliated forces in the current system year. This is necessary to prevent further interference with The Family's development and the Charmony Festival."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=13178","text":"Wingweaver Wingweavers are a species of feathered hominids who constitute the main branch of the Denizens of Abundance. They formerly resided in the tree-shaped world of Muldrasil, but since that world's destruction they have now been reduced to being mercenaries and pirates. According to the Surveillance Report from the Xianzhou Yuque, the Peacock Legion of the Wingweavers is possibly trying to revive their homeworld. Description. Physiology. Compared to standard humans, the wingweavers' anatomical features are more akin to that of birds. They possess highly-developed back muscles, a pair (or multiple pairs) of feathered wings, elongated feet, and powerful toe structures that can push them off the ground. The wingweavers are masters of flight, with cruise speed up to 400 kilometers per hour. Their bones and muscles contain special vacuoles that allow them to perform rapid dives and astounding bursts of acceleration. Similarly, such structures allow them to fly and move in the vacuum of outer space. However, they still need to periodically leave vacuum environments to obtain air. In battle, they like to fire volleys from a distance, as their flight and mobility can be outperformed by the weight and stamina of their enemy when fighting in melee. Culture. Wingweaver culture looks down on terrestrial sentient races that cannot fly, calling them \"Residents of Dirt\" while the Wingweavers themselves are called \"Cloudlords.\" They enslave these other sentient races to produce resources and maintain their world tree, Muldrasil. Through the outstretched branches of Muldrasil, the armies of the wingweavers warp to different worlds to plunder resources and lives. The wingweavers allot their positions in Muldrasil strictly according to their social structure. The one residing at the topmost branch is the master of the holy celestine nest, the Wingperor of the wingweavers. Traditionally, they are considered an Emanator of Abundance responsible for growing Muldrasil and nurturing the winged people. Under them are the Sky-Defenders (the warrior class), the Hymn-Singers (the academics and secretaries), the Infant-Nurturers (the servant class), and the Bough-Pickers (the laborers). Below Muldrasil's five major castes are the Residents of Dirt, the lowest of the low \u2014 including all sentient races from other worlds that do not possess the ability to fly. As Muldrasil has been destroyed, the exact political structures of the wingweavers are no longer clear. The IPC's intelligence mentioned that all wingweavers scattered throughout the universe now belong to a certain wingweaver's mercenary company. Technology. The technology that the wingweavers demonstrated in intergalactic warfare allows us to deduce that their civilization had experienced a great decline. On the one hand, they possess \"branches\" that allow them to space warp. On the other hand, their resource supplies and weapon manufacturing are completely reliant on plundering external parties, or on trade with other Denizens of Abundance. They are found to have been equipped with the weapons and armors of borisins during all three Denizens of Abundance Wars. History. The wingweavers are an ancient race, having existed and made contact with the Xianzhou Alliance in the Primevum Imperium Era, before the Xianzhou ships left their home world. Based on the fragmented historical records in the History of the Xianzhou, the wingweavers arrived from beyond the sky, slaughtered and plundered, and conducted \"evils uncountable\". The sovereign raised armies and annihilated the invaders. They imprisoned numerous \"magicians\" of the wingweavers and obtained their \"miraculous recipes\". This was the reason the Xianzhou fleet set sail. The sovereign whose name has been erased from history dispatched the Xianzhou fleet to seek immortality from a god in the deep stellar seas. The wingweavers invaded the Xianzhou fleet for the second time during the Flaming Catastrophe War. They cast down their branches and almost annihilated the Luofu. This was during the Era of Bloodshed, when the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium \u2014 Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war breaks out as a result. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation are released to counter the invasion \u2014 including the Reignbow who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan,\" causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu. The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrating Muldrasil. Around 5320 Star Calendar, their homeworld of Muldrasil was attacked and destroyed by the Antimatter Legion, as observed by the Xianzhou Yuque. Since then, many wingweavers have become lost wanderers in space, reduced to mercenaries and intergalactic pirates. Despite this, on the Year 5700 Star Calendar, Lord Ravager and Overlord Celenova boarded the Xianzhou Zhuming requesting a ceasefire and the ship to change course and assist in attacking the homeworld of the wingweavers."}

Although they are not deadly, they have the potential to cause trouble and should be kept under medium containment levels. Classification. Wubbaboos are a type of spiritual organism that belong to the Heliobus species of the Spirit Essence family. They are categorized as Kingdom Spiritual Organisms, Class Astral Spirits, Order Shapeless, and are known for their mischievous nature. According to Adler's Tier System, Wubbaboo's have a medium containment level. Origins. The concept of spiritual organisms represented by Astral Spirits can be traced back to the beginning of the Amber Era. The Leviathan's Conception Theory suggests that some elder Leviathans were stranded after the Dusk Wars, and during their long sleep, their decomposed cells became the seedbed for organic organisms while their dissipating life force became wandering Astral Spirits. However, recent studies have denounced this theory, and more research is needed to determine the exact origin of Astral Spirits. Behavior. Initially, Astral Spirits were aimless and lacked individual will. However, during the Trailblaze, as humans began to travel through the galaxy, the Astral Spirits became attracted to their freedom of travel. The Astral Spirits were drawn to human emotions, particularly love and lust, and would possess the bodies of those who emitted strong emotions. Those who were unable to merge with the Astral Spirits died on the spot. However, some individuals managed to form a symbiotic relationship with the Astral Spirits. These spirits were feared for their exceptional abilities to sense emotions and control people's hearts and minds. Wubbaboos have inherited the abilities of their Astral Spirit ancestors but are not as deadly. They enjoy scaring people and appear as ghostly, semi-transparent, shifting forms. Once they attach themselves to a host, the personality of the host changes dramatically, and their behavior becomes completely altered. They commit a series of pranks, and after they get bored, the host regains consciousness. Although they are not deadly, they have the potential to cause a lot of trouble and should be kept from breaking loose."}

The Xianzhou primarily uses the Star Calendar to keep time. It is similar to the Trailblaze Calendar in that it uses the 12 standardized months and 12 standardized months is equal to one year in the Star Calendar. However, if a readable states the month and day, they rarely note down the Star Calendar Year. The same applies vice versa. The day of departure is deemed as the beginning of the Star Calendar. As many of the Xianzhou's historical records and readables are recorded in Star Calendar format and there is currently no stated method to correspond the timeline to either the Amber Era or the Trailblaze Calendar, the timeline below will be noted using Star Calendar Years. Primeval Imperium Era. The Primeval Imperium Era is marked as the time before the Xianzhou ships departed their ancient planet. Lone Voyage Era. The Lone Voyage Era is marked as the start of the Xianzhou civilization after the nine ships departed the planet. According to ancient ship logbooks in the Intelligentsia Guild, the dates could be traced back to seven millennia ago if converted to Amber Era calculations.

The Fanghu. \"*A travel brochure produced by the Exalting Sanctum travel agency, Star-Picking Tours*\" Xianzhou Fanghu Travel Tips The Xianzhou Fanghu used to be the most famous tourist attraction of the Xianzhou Alliance. Unfortunately, the place could no longer accommodate vast numbers of tourists in recent years and even stopped issuing new travel passes briefly due to the damage inflicted by the third Abundance War. Now that the new travel policy is in place, we can visit the beautiful waters of the Miniature Myriads again. According to the regional policy, a Xianzhou Alliance Travel Pass and a Fanghu Travel Pass, which has to be applied two to three months in advance, are required to travel in the Fanghu. The same rules apply to Xianzhou citizens. Those whose residency papers are under the jurisdiction of the Xianzhou Alliance are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by the Realm-Keeping Commission of their domicile to the Sky-Faring Commission of the Fanghu. Travelers from other worlds are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by their place of residence and the certificate of no criminal record issued by the IPC. The procedure is slightly complicated, but the travel pass issued by the Fanghu's Sky-Faring Commission is valid for 20 years, so you do not have to repeatedly go through the process. Please note that the Fanghu is an autonomous dominion of the Vidyadhara, thus it has different customs, culture, and social structures from other Xianzhou ships. Please purchase a copy of the Fanghu Lifestyle Guide from the Star-Picking Tours before departure to avoid unintended mistakes. Xianzhou Fanghu Must-see Attractions [Claretgleam Bay] The Claretgleam Bay in the Sanze Delve is the first stop for most travelers who visit the Fanghu. Many are immediately impressed by the water that flows peacefully on top of the dome of the delve the moment they disembark from their starskiffs. Many might have already witnessed this scene through an immersia or hologram before their arrival but let there be no doubt \u2014 nothing beats seeing it with your very own eyes. Look up and admire the sea! You will see the Shangguan Sea Snakes gliding past with their massive bodies, the Lantern Fish sparkling like fireflies when they huddle together, and the Srimanth Conches hunting for schools of fish like nimble missiles... The Claretgleam Bay is arguably the only place in the Cosmos that can offer you such a mind-blowing experience. [Reignbow's Road Museum] The Reignbow's Road Museum is located in the East Sea Delve. Its name in full is \"Third Abundance War Reignbow's Road Museum.\" As the entire East Sea Delve was razed to the ground during the war, the museum was built upon the ruins. In Reignbow's Road Museum, you will get to watch a holographic History of Reignbow's Road formed using the Vidyadhara's cloudhymn magic. During this immersive experience, you will witness how the catastrophe took place and learn how the Abundance Axis launched an aggressive attack against the Fanghu, and how the Pearlkeepers put up a tenacious defense, but to no avail as the Abundance Axis managed to invade the delve in the end. To prevent further destruction, the Reignbow Arbiter appeared to wipe out the fleet of the Abundance Axis with divine arrows and annihilated many corrupted delves. Among them, East Sea Delve was the only one that was simpled \"reduced to ruins.\" The most stunning exhibition hall in the museum is none other than the Palace of Mortal World, where the Fanghu and IPC have built a replica of Moundfish Avenue, the busiest area in East Sea Delve before the war. The daily lives of the 39,823 residents is manifested in the form of Mirage Echoes showing their comings and goings prior to the disaster. If you chat with them, you will realize that they are ordinary people just like you who probably also never expected they would perish during the war. Reignbow's Road Museum offers free entry to travelers as the citizens of Fanghu want to show more people the purpose behind the Xianzhou Alliance's endeavors. [Wild Shore] The Wild Shore is the most renowned beach in the Fanghu. Despite the complicated travel pass application procedure, the attraction still welcomes almost 70 million travelers every year. The biggest appeal of the Wild Shore is that it is both a hot spring and a beach. The water there is rich in microbes beneficial for the health of one's skin, and the shore is blessed with a magnificent stretch of white sand and beautiful natural scenery. However, its extreme popularity is its most significant drawback, so much so that you will only get to admire the beach during the off-season, when the sands are not literally covered with the bodies of tourists. The Yaoqing. \"*A travel brochure produced by the Exalting Sanctum travel agency, Star-Picking Tours*\" Xianzhou Yaoqing Travel Tips You do not have to go through any extra procedures to visit the Xianzhou Yaoqing. As long as you are a Xianzhou Alliance citizen or a holder of the Xianzhou Alliance Travel Pass or Resident Permit, you are allowed to visit the Yaoqing. Considering that the Yaoqing is often sailing through active war zones, you are advised to prepare more safety measures before departure. If you are interested, you can sign up for the Yaoqing tour with Star-Picking Tours. Many travelers have contacted us to ask if it is safe to travel to Xianzhou Yaoqing. We completely understand your concern. However, please do not worry, as the military operations of the Yaoqing is mainly done by the expeditionary fleet and will not endanger the main ship. Of course, that doesn't mean the Denizens of Abundance are not constantly fixated on their need to eradicate this \"catastrophe,\" but rest assured, for no enemies have ever managed to deal any substantial damage to the Yaoqing's main ship since the last Amber Era. \"(Having said that, it is still vital for travelers to strictly abide by the Yaoqing's regulations during the trip. Unauthorized departure from the tour group may constitute a violation of law or even a criminal offense.)\" Xianzhou Yaoqing Must-see Attractions [Caelorum Venti Pavilion] The Caelorum Venti Pavilion in Moon Delve is one of the most well-known tourist sites of the Yaoqing. The place commemorates how the previous Caelorum Venti, high elder of the Yaoqing, fought valiantly and slew an herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the pavilion with large slabs of jade and moonstone. It is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style, as no language can describe its exquisiteness and grandeur adequately. Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment. Please follow the rules and regulations of the Caelorum Venti Pavilion during your visit. We will not be responsible for mishaps that occur due to violations of the rules and regulations. [Verdant Harbor] At the Verdant Harbor in the Verdant Delve, we will get a glimpse of the Yaoqing's unique starskiff manufacturing process. The guide will take visitors through the entire place to see how those furry little creatures grow to become loyal partners of the Verdant Knights that are capable of eradicating demons. New starskiffs are born almost every day. With the help of the staff, you will have the chance to deliver a new starskiff and experience the miracle of biotechnology. You might even get to name the new starskiff, which will be seen eliminating Denizens of Abundance on the battlefield and fighting for the survival of the entire Cosmos in a few short months. [Red Fox Theater] After a long day filled with exciting and touching moments, it is time to engage in some elegant and soothing activities for a change of mood. You will get to enjoy the most authentic and traditional \"Pacify Play\" in Red Fox Theater on Baiheng Street. Pacify Play is a traditional theater performance of the Yaoqing Foxians. Be prepared to be blown away by the vast circular stage when you set foot in the theater. Red Fox Theater is one of the few that rejects the use of special effects to preserve their millennium-old traditions. They indeed need a large stage to be able to showcase all elements of the play. This type of traditional opera uses different types of facial makeup to differentiate the characters and their personalities, so it requires some prior knowledge to be able to understand the story.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=15030","text":"Xianzhou Native Xianzhou Natives, formally known as \"Homo celestinae\", are a long-lived subspecies of humans originating from the nine ships that left the distant Xianzhou homeworld in search of the Aeon Yaoshi. In the present day, they are one of the three long-life species that compose the Xianzhou Alliance \u2014 the others being Foxians and Vidyadhara. Description. Origin. The Xianzhou natives originally came from a planet ruled by the Primeval Imperium. At some point before the fleet originated, they had a great battle against the wingweavers, a Denizens of Abundance race. The sovereign raised armies to defeat the wingweavers, and became fixated on immortality after obtaining \"miraculous recipes\" from captured wingweaver magicians. A fleet of nine ships were constructed and sent out into space to search for Yaoshi the Abundance in order to obtain immortality. Yaoshi bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor upon the Xianzhou Luofu. The Xianzhou people ate the Arbor's fruits and thus gained immortality. However, this came with a heavy price, as the people felt the long-lasting negative effects of immortality, which they called \"Mara\". They began to resent their longevity, as it turned them into monsters. Biology. While Xianzhou natives are nearly indistinguishable from short-life humans in terms of outward appearance, their internal biology differs significantly. Xianzhou natives stop physically aging once they reach adulthood, and can remain in this unchanging state for upwards of a millennium if they are lucky. They have an average lifespan of about 800 years. Inevitably, however, all Xianzhou natives eventually succumb to the degenerative condition known as mara. Because of their altered physiology, Xianzhou natives also have regenerative capabilities far beyond those of most short-life species. However, this comes with its drawbacks \u2014 many implants and body-altering technologies used by short-life species are entirely rejected by Xianzhou natives' bodies, which always revert back to their \"default\" state before long. Xianzhou natives have an organ known as their Core Esse, which is believed by some to be the source of their regeneration and immortality. Xianzhou natives cells can shift as needed between differentiated cells and stem cells. This conversion obeys specific rules that will never create a single error. The rule dictating this conversion is not set according to internal hormonal levels or any other parameters, but a \"standard\" set in stone the moment the individual was born. As cells shift between differentiation and omnipotence, the person's bodily characteristics are forever set at their original \"standard.\" This phenomenon, which goes against the fundamental creed of biology, is called the miracle of the Plagues Author. At a certain critical point of the long-life species' life cycle, this power from the Plagues Author will suddenly enter a new stage \u2014 the original standard will be over-written and the body will start to develop catastrophically, turning a civilized \"human\" into a mindless \"abomination.\" This is what is commonly called \"mara-struck.\" The very first Xianzhou immortal, known as \"Primus Immortus,\" is presently still alive and imprisoned in the Shackling Prison. Their body routinely grows limbs, wings, bone spikes, and other bodily structures. Some doctors believe that because the people of the Xianzhou have immortal bodies, their memories accumulate until no more can be stored in the brain. Only the most vivid and extreme memories persist, but such memories are usually ones of regret, hatred, grief, and other negative emotions. That's when the symptoms of being stricken with mara begin to show. It is also believed that veteran soldiers are far more likely than everyday citizens to be stricken with mara, due to post-traumatic stress. Xianzhou natives with disabilities are known as \"Incomplete Ones.\" Those born with missing limbs can have non-invasive prosthetic limbs attached, but for people with internal issues such as Dan Shu, non-intrusive methods are of little help. Attempting to replace a person's biological organs with artificial ones will result in the body eventually rejecting it, causing extreme pain for the person. Dan Shu was able to see with her transplanted eyes for about eleven days before they failed. Mara-stricken \"Incomplete Ones\" have been known to recover from their disabilities upon onset. Dan Shu noted one such case where a man born without limbs completely regrew them after being struck with mara. She also notes that there are no \"Incomplete Ones\" among the Borisin, another species with strong connections to the Abundance. Culture. Because of their long lifespans, Xianzhou natives do not place much value on funeral ceremonies. Ordinarily, people approaching the end of their lives are guided to the Hall of Karma by the Ten-Lords Commission, before any symptoms of mara appear. They then wait for their time to come and peacefully give up their lives. However, there exists a funeral rite called the \"soul-soothing ceremony,\" similar to \"the Returning\" of the Foxians, where the deceased person's belongings are placed on an empty starskiff and sent off to sail between the stars. This ceremony is usually performed for Cloud Knights who have died in battle or become mara-struck. Some Xianzhou Natives have also adopted the Foxian birthfate custom."}

Mail Origin: Planet Xin-41Mail Type: Family GreetingsExamination Result: Passed, no memetic virus presentExaminer: Elizabeth WatsonSend to: Department of Ecology - Entry Researcher - Eikura Shuu Dear Shuu, Your dad and I are very happy to have received your third letter. It made him so happy that he lit a Harmonious Joy that he has saved for many years to celebrate. I couldn't stop him. You know what I'm talking about. Ever since the Slinkans announced the ban on spices, all related products have been removed from our daily lives. Your dad is risking being arrested and physical punishment to celebrate. He even showed the entire town your letter. Please understand that he's not trying to breach our family's privacy. It's just that he's genuinely proud of having you as his son. That night, everyone bunched together to read your letter. The Curio in the space station that you mentioned is something unheard-of here. And the descriptions of the researchers you work with, heh, well, to people like us who have spent their entire lives on Xin-41, they sound like geniuses compared to even the Slinkans. However, according to what you said in your letter, the Slinkans aren't the embodiment of the truth nor the dominion of the universe. Then does that mean they aren't able to bring our civilization to its apex? Are there really more majestic beings than the Slinkans? To be honest, this is all a little too much for me. I tried looking through historical records in the pile of dusty books about the period before the Slinkans arrived but was stopped by your father. He said that the only reason I would attempt to do something as risky as reading banned books is that I had nothing better to do. I was about to use your words to talk back to him, but he said that if I had the time for that, I'm better off gathering another basket of leaves from the spice fields so that we would have enough money to send you a few more things from home next harvest season. I thought about it. Your father was right. These things are better left to you young people to think about. Oh, and there was a boy who got really excited reading your letter. His name is Milo, and he used to attend the same academy as you. Let me think... He stood on a chair and said you have brought brand-new knowledge to everyone. He said that you were... the fire bringer... or something. He quickly left after saying that. At the time I'm writing this letter, he has already been missing for twenty-two days. And today, in the foggy morning, his body was discovered. The morning fog has been very thick recently on Xin-41. I think it's because the Slinkans have increased the burning of spices. I think they're celebrating some sort of holiday or welcoming someone important. A number of small spacecrafts flew frequently around the Slinkan Residential Area. But I digress. Back to Milo. He was lying in the wilderness a hundred meters from the Slinkan Residential Area. His eyes, mouth, ears, and abdomen were stuffed full with used spices. The townspeople all said this is a warning from the Slinkans. We buried Milo on a small hill, on the side where the dark yellow lilacs blossom. A few people cried, including your father. They loudly denounced the thick smoke and how it makes their eyes hurt, but quietly claim that Milo's individualistic style cost him his life. If he had an idea, he should've talked to everyone about it. They also said that he was stubborn like a pair of fire tongs, and didn't rat anyone out till his death. Don't worry, after what had happened, I won't ever let your dad carelessly share your letters again. Oh, I've also got something that's been bothering everyone. Aren't you working at Herta Space Station? Then what does Madam Herta mean? Is that a person? From your descriptions, she sounds like a Slinkan. Intelligent, wealthy, cold, and a little crazy. You've dealt with Slinkans on Xin-41 for more than a decade, so it's no surprise you were able to earn her favor. Obviously, I'm not saying that your work isn't just as splendid. I believe that getting number one in your evaluation is a result of an immense amount of hard work. But then again, you've already proven you were capable of that when you first passed the exam and received the ticket to board the space station. Oh, and that Master Capote you talked about. Him being so nice to you shows that there are more good people than not in the cosmos, or why would the stories of the Galaxy Ranger be passing around everywhere? If you are a big celebrity on the space station as you say, then you need to be even more careful and restrained. Please don't mind my nagging, I just don't want you to be impulsive and pay the price for it. A mother knows her son better than anyone ever could. Well, that's all the reminders I have for you. I've been dreaming about you lately. In my dream, you locked yourself in a black house. It makes me very worried. Maybe it's because I'm getting old. I let my imaginations get the better of me and it's been affecting my sleep. I'm always worrying about if your work is going well, if you're eating enough, if you've lost weight, if you're wearing enough clothes... and all sorts of other questions. I had the Astral Logistics send you a pair of wool pants I spent an entire season knitting, but it was rejected by the space station... They said that everyone there wears protective uniforms and have no use for something crude like this. Your dad was furious and tossed the pants in the new house we purchased for you. We basically spent all the savings we had from harvesting spices on that house. We're not recklessly spending money. There aren't many other luxuries to be had with the Slinkans ruling the place. We both hope that you can get married and start a family of your own soon. But if you don't plan on staying on Xin-41, then that's a whole different story. After all, that would be something completely beyond both of our imaginations. Oh Shuu, Mom wishes you health and happiness. Hop on a warp ship soon and come home to us."}

The Family will celebrate each new world that accepts the blessing of Xipe, and work even harder at praising the Aeon's kindness. The Family has never known any world that grew weary of the singing and voluntarily abandoned the Path of Harmony. Penacony Chapter. Penacony is a chapter of The Family. Its spokesperson is Sunday. Penacony, Land of the Dreams, is an intergalactic hotel. The real Penacony is in the Dreamscape that is entered through the Dreampool in The Reverie Hotel. The Penacony of the Dreamscape is crafted through the combined efforts of Family members, Dreamchasers, and guests.

Few have seen them outside The Family. Simulated Universe. When Xipe appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: Dev Log 1. Related Entry \u2014 The Harmony ...Xipe the Harmony. Oh, the mother of all stars! THEY proclaimed harmonious hymns of celebration, and united all wills as one. The Family's songs spread to all corners of the world, and THEIR degree of understanding, support, and synergy for the will of all creatures was beyond imagination. Or perhaps, THEY were already on a plane beyond mortal minds. The ever-expanding Harmony was truly worthy of human longing. The universe encircles and decorates THEIR body like crushed diamonds, and civilization became a rainbow to be snatched in THEIR palm. I am filled with curiosity about how THEY swallowed up Order. The hymns of Xipe continue to spread and grow, occasionally overseen by ideology. In contrast, Ena's harmonic songs seems to align within a three-dimensional framework, akin to an emperor maintaining hierarchical order among all creatures. While there may be some overlap between THEIR Paths, the ancient Order is enormous in size, and swallowing THEM would prove far from effortless... Among the Aeons, there exist countless enigmas that surpass my own speculations."}

After finding Yaoshi, the Xianzhou Luofu was gifted with the Ambrosial Arbor, a giant tree that took root on the ship. The ancestors of the Luofu people ate its fruits and became a long-life species. However, this came with a heavy price. What followed was population expansion and diminishing resources. Other beings attacked the Xianzhou to take their sacred artifact and countless atrocities were commited. Those who survived the war realized they were susceptible to \"Mara,\" a condition long-life species suffer, turning them into \"Beasts.\" They began to resent it. Other plaguemarks, also known as Traces of Abundance, include the Lunar Embryo on the Yaoqing, the Primordial Flame on the Zhuming, the Miniature Myriads on the Fanghu, and the Fallow Earth on the Yuque. According to Sushang, the Yaoqing's plaguemark is a moon. Five High Elders of the Vidyadhara descended to keep watch over the plaguemarks. Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus continued to worship Yaoshi as other Aeons like Qlipoth the Preservation, known as the Firmamend Arbiter among the Xianzhou, and Lan the Hunt, became ascendant in the Xianzhou Alliance. Although sharing the same name, the Disciples consist of two distinct groups. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to differentiate them from the more recent group, believed that the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed. The Old Disciples were not a notorious group for a long time and accepted skepticism with an open mind. They built apothecaries to help the poor and needy. They were treated with pity by those who had long abandoned their belief in Yaoshi but were not particularly detested. They existed in secret for thousands of years and eventually became the Cold Springs sect, which overhauled the entire Xianzhou healthcare system. After the Three Sufferings era, the Xianzhou completely banned belief in Yaoshi. The more recent group of Disciples, considered criminals in the Xianzhou, is less than 30 years old and arose in the wake of the Third Abundance War. Some blamed the Alliance and the Hunt for the suffering they endured. They used the same name as the old group, gathered around a \"master primus\", and claimed to have inherited the knowledge and legacy of the Theophany Era. They sought to lead the Xianzhou into the embrace of Yaoshi. In response, the Cold Springs sect published a statement clarifying that they no longer believed in Yaoshi. Foxians. The Foxians and borisin share a common ancestor. Foxian epics tell how the races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. But later historical developments saw the borisin consider the Foxians as slaves or cannon fodder, fueling their desire to conquer the stars. According to, the Foxians came from a world known as the Old Verdant Home. Their home world was ravaged by the borisin and they sought the help of gods to stop the borisin's rampage. Among the Foxians who fled from war, there were six brothers who fell into particularly dire straits. Their lamentations shook the mountains and sea, echoing into the skies. The Master of Immortality descended and asked them why they were wailing. The eldest brother cried because he feared the borisin's blades. The second brother sobbed due to the pain of disease. The third brother lamented out of cowardice and fear. The fourth brother was weak and powerless. The fifth brother witnessed the slaughter of family and friends and the enslavement of the living. The sixth brother longed for peace. The Master of Immortality granted gifts to each brother: to the eldest brother regeneration, the second brother freedom from disease, the third brother endless courage, the fourth brother wings on his back, the fifth brother freedom from all concerns. Only the sixth brother was given nothing. The five brothers bestowed with powers drove back the borisin, but their powers came with a price. The eldest brother's wounds festered and rotted, the second brother spread disease to his kin, the third brother's mind was twisted with hate, the fourth brother grew feathers all over his body, and the fifth brother lost all consciousness. Only the sixth brother was untouched, but as he raided the borisin bands seeking death, the borisin Warmuhtar showed him a reflection of his image in the mirror. Only then did the sixth brother realize he had transformed into a canine beast like the borisin. Borisin. According to borisin folk songs, their first Warmuhtar, Duran, obtained immortality from the dew of a tree guarded by Foxians tasked by Yaoshi to protect it. The song claims that Yaoshi only blessed the strong and used the Foxians as a test. After Duran and the beast, Taowu, slaughtered the Foxians, Duran asked Yaoshi to bless the borisin with immortality. However this narrative is a fictional myth created by the borisin to justify their enslavement of the Foxians and to solidify their racial identity through their worship. Yaoshi does not bless only the strong and it is evident that the borisin interpret \"Abundance\" based on their own cultural norms and values. Based on the level of borisin civilization at the time of their unexpected rise, it is implausible that they initiated contact with Yaoshi, who probably bestowed THEIR gifts indiscriminately. Ruan Mei. Ruan Mei's home planet is an icy snow world blessed by the Abundance. Abilities. Immortality. Yaoshi has the power to grant mortals the blessing of long-life. THEY bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor on the Xianzhou Luofu, turning the Xianzhou natives into a long-life species. Foxian epics tell how the races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. According to, their first Warmuhtar, Duran, obtained immortality from the dew of a tree and the rest of the borisin obtained immortality after Duran requested it from Yaoshi, who let the dew fall on the land. The degree of immortality differs according to each race and individual. Foxians have a lifespan of 250\u2013450 years with a median age of death at 307. Xianzhou Natives have an average lifespan of 800 years before succumbing to mara. Foxians, Xianzhou Natives, and borisins all have enhanced regenerative healing capabilities, with the borisin being the greatest among them. The heliobus species, an Abundance energy lifeform, is so imperishable that trapping them and using them as an energy source is considered the best way to deal with them. Certain individuals such as the first Xianzhou immortal \"Primus Immortus\" and the Abundance Emanator Shuhu may be functionally immortal and unkillable. The first Xianzhou immortal is still alive and imprisoned in the Shackling Prison while Shuhu may have been killed in an attack on the Xianzhou, but according to the, there is a box which may contain Shuhu, also confined in the Shackling Prison. Shuhu's flesh was used by Blade in an attempt to revive his dead friend, Baiheng. The revival failed and instead Blade gained healing properties so strong that he has come back from death hundreds of times ever since. Another entity, the Void Existence, was able to gain immortality by consuming the blood of 3,120 Xianzhou residents. Mara. Yaoshi is closely connected to the phenomenon known as Mara, something specially prevalent to Long-life species who have obtained their immortality from Yaoshi. The condition turns individuals into \"Beasts\" and robs them of their sanity. According to records in the Cloud Knights Marital Doctrine, those who come into contact with Yaoshi the Aeon of Abundance can become struck with mara instantly. Even trying to divine the fate of Yaoshi will cause the diviner to become mara-struck. Simulated Universe. When Yaoshi appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: Dev Log1. Related Entry \u2014 The Abundance ...There is a lot of debate in the Guild about whether Yaoshi is good or evil, and I think that's just people having too much time on their hands. Anyone with the slightest respect for the universe wouldn't apply our narrow definitions of good and evil to incomprehensible existences such as Aeons. Personally, I have an open mind when it comes to Yaoshi \u2014 I will help the Xianzhou Alliance to sort out the Abominations of Abundance, but it won't stop me from genuinely admiring Yaoshi as a lonely and romantic existence. THEY travel between the universe with The Hunt and the Alliance in hot pursuit, both of which have sworn to destroy THEM... And yet THEY continue to bring enlightenment to world after world. I understand that the Abundance had never taken a single life, even though those THEY come into contact with often end up with a fate worse than death... Dev Log2. Related Entry \u2014 The Abundance ...Does Yaoshi the Abundance actually understand THEIR actions and consequences? People across the universe hold polarized views on this. One party thinks Yaoshi does know of the consequences but does not care. Another party believes Yaoshi is tightly constrained by THEIR Path and cannot receive information outside of the Path. I gave some serious thought to this question when I wrote the chapter on Abundance in my book \"How I Joined the Genius Society\", and my final conclusion was \"I don't know.\" Ahhh \u2014 We know so little about Aeons! I wouldn't have placed so much hope on the Simulated Universe Apparently, Yaoshi had spoken to the Denizens of Abundance and THEIR pursuer Xianzhou, and I hope the simulated Yaoshi would be willing to speak a few words to (Trailblazer) as well..."}

His current identity is Blade, a member of the Stellaron Hunters. History. As a child, Yingxing's homeworld was destroyed by the borisin and transformed into one of their weapons nurseries. He somehow made his way to the Xianzhou on a merchant vessel, where he was discovered by Master Huaiyan of the Xianzhou Zhuming's Artisanship Commission and made his apprentice. Yingxing vowed to make weapons for the Cloud Knights in order to avenge his home and family, and was an exceedingly talented craftsman, described as being incredible at his work by earning accolades at such a young age. During his time on the Zhuming, Yingxing met Baiheng when she was assigned to a delegation to request arms and reinforcements from the ship for the Yaoqing's Crane Feather Orbit Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the borisin. He was tasked with receiving the delegation at Radiant Zenith and escorting them to his Master at Flamedisk Forge Palace. Along the way, Baiheng talked to the shy and insecure boy, who she started calling Little Yingxing, and he opened up about his past to her. Once there, Huaiyan was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Helm-Master Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel. Though Yingxing was a shy boy in his youth, he became more confident as he grew up, and was described to be an arrogant man by many. Over time, Yingxing forged hundreds of weapons, four being his most famous. These weapons were subsequently used by the members of the High-Cloud Quintet, and he was assumedly inducted by Jingliu into the group. While he didn't fight on the front lines, Yingxing was still present during battles with military engineers. Yingxing was shown to be close to the other Quintet members, and would regularly drink and spar with them. At some point, fellow member Dan Feng, the High Elder of the Xianzhou Luofu's Vidyadhara at the time, allowed Yingxing into the Dragon Palace at Scalegorge Waterscape to return a favor. In the Year 7379 of the Star Calendar, in an event that later came to be known as the \"Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae,\" Dan Feng caused turmoil by \"stealing\" the power of the Abundance and changing the Transmutation Arcanum, breaking the foremost of ten unpardonable sins on the Xianzhou, with the help of Yingxing. This event occurred in the aftermath of a devastating war against Shuhu, an Emanator of Yaoshi, where Baiheng lost her life. Their tampering with the Ambrosial Arbor caused the creation of a draconic beast, and because of Yingxing's involvement and use of Shuhu's flesh in the process, he was transformed into an immortal being and struck with mara. This caused Yingxing to harbor an immense resentment for Dan Feng, and in turn, his reincarnation, Dan Heng. In the aftermath of the Sedition, Yingxing was assumedly banished from the Xianzhou, and lost a majority of his memories. During this time he was discovered by Jingliu, who taught him swordplay, but also killed him multiple times to remind him of the karma of his past actions. He went on to seek out Dan Heng with murderous intent, chasing him across multiple IPC spaceships. No matter how many times they fought and Dan Heng killed him in self-defense, Yingxing always came back in pursuit. Some time after this, he was discovered by Elio, who saw a use for his immortality, and was convinced to join the Stellaron Hunters in exchange for a deal, promising to bring an \"eternal end and final funeral\" to his life and everything he had ever hated."}

Because it was really fun for you, wasn't it? I don't know if you like this joke about unshackling, but I hope you do. I hope you can sincerely say \"Aha!\" from the bottom of your heart. Perhaps one day we will meet again at \"the tavern.\" At that time, please allow me to buy you a martini with a topology olive and some Barnsley fractal peppers (that's my favorite). Love, Zhongshan"}

Sometimes these animated objects can be affected by dangerous emotions or memories and transform into the destructive Dreamjolt Troupe.

After The Family planned to eliminate all the monsters in dreamscape hotel, she made a deal with Amiky to help restore her relationship with and regain the support of the Iris Family, and The Family eventually stopped their plan.

You even forgot to sleep!\" \"That won't do. I'm gonna fill my stomach and get back to my research.\" It was not until recently that he learned to keep some canned food in his drawer in the lab. This only made him stay longer in the lab than before. In the beginning, many young ladies set their eyes on Artem, for a little while at least. But everyone soon realized that the humanoid organism named Artem seems unable to develop emotional connections with others. What a pity. In his own words, \"For now, I want to adventure.\" The Ancient Relic Expedition Team belongs to the Belobog Museum. They are a team of adventurers responsible for finding Old World relics in the areas surrounding Belobog. Retrieved relics will be studied extensively by the archeologists and historians. However, their work must be done in a harsh blizzard environment. Dangerous situations and accidents are frequent in this line of work, which requires both wisdom and courage. Without a doubt, these archeologists are the true explorers of Belobog. It shouldn't come as a surprise that the explorers may die at any moment. This moment was no different. Artem moved towards the cliff face as he dragged the lower half of his body with difficulty. The wind was much weaker here, making sure he can breathe a little easier before his inevitable death. His vision was blurry, but he couldn't tell whether it was due to the blizzard or if his eyes were wounded. He tried looking up the cliff where he probably fell from. Did the team member he pulled up find safety? He must have, right? It was only a matter of time before he joined the other team members. That's a relief... He was exhausted, and his vision gradually grew dim. If he fell asleep now, during this blizzard, he would never wake up, that's for sure. The heavy abdominal bleeding had frozen solid, and Artem was unsure of how he would eventually die. It hardly mattered to him at this point. As the blizzard grew more violent, Artem would soon become a corpse just like the ones he had passed by on previous adventures. It gave him some relief to think he wouldn't be alone. He was just three years old when he climbed the drainpipe to the rooftop, much to the horror of his parents... What was happening? Was his life already flashing before his eyes? Ah, how many memories does one make in a lifetime... Artem had drifted off to sleep under the cliff. The flame of his life flickered in the blizzard. It was about to die out. Chapter 2: Frozen City (I). \"Continuation: Artem was rescued by an unknown man and his daughter, and later woke up in a small medical facility. What he saw was a strange world unlike Belobog. Everything here was made from \"Rain Water,\" and the resident here lived in harmony with the wind and the snow. Artem was amazed by the wondrous sights built from special materials...\" As the flow of time continued, Artem found himself lying in a medical facility. However, this medical facility had nothing in common with Belobog's Architects' Charice Hospital. No hospital in Belobog would have beds made of crystals. It wasn't until Artem noticed the IV drip attached to his arm that he realized that he was being treated. There was drumming in his ears. His eyes were only able to make out the blurred, burning lights around him. Apparently, his motor skills haven't returned. What's for sure is that he had almost crossed over to the other side. The first person he met after being discharged from the hospital was the girl that helped him in his dreams. \"Congratulations on your recovery.\" \"Thank you. Could you tell me where... Who are you... I should probably introduce myself first... No, wait...\" Artem was filled with questions. His words became jumbled, and he was unable to form a complete sentence. \"My name is Anna.\" \"I'm A-Artem...\" Unlike the first time they met, Anna didn't tie her hair. The light shown through her flaxen hair with translucent edges. The soft glow made her hair look as if it was delicately lifted. her long eyelashes and calming eyes matched her thin face perfectly. In the past, Artem tried to avoid observing a woman's facial features for too long. With Anna, however, he couldn't stop until both their faces were flushed with embarrassment. Perhaps it had something to do with his life having being saved, but Artem felt something he had never felt before. Just as Artem had predicted, he was not in Belobog. It was a city that had been built in the blizzard. People called it the Frozen City. Different from Belobog, the Frozen City's forebears used the Old World technology to survive in the blizzard and preserve the spark of the Old World civilization. Artem was in the happiest phase of culture shock. Everything was brand new to him, like in one of his countless dreams, in which the technologies of the past lying dormant in the museum come back to life. Accompanied by Anna, this city gradually unfolded before Artem. \"They should have also injected an Edelweiss into your body during your surgery.\" \"Edelweiss... What is Edelweiss?\" \"Ah, how should I put it? It's like a small... machine?\" \"Machine? I thought machines were big things with chains, gears, valves, and steam? They... can be injected into the body?\" \"I don't understand the principle very well. I just know all residents of Frozen City are injected with Edelweiss at birth. We do not fear the cold because of it. When I was little, the explorers told me that outsiders wear heavy clothes to stay warm. It wasn't until I saw you that I realized it was true.\" \"So in the eyes of the local population?\", such warm clothes must be quite an unusual view... Right, speaking of which, are there other cities in this world besides Frozen City?\" \"But of course, the world is a big place.\" Anna suddenly stopped in her tracks, and Artem followed suit. In the clearing in front of them, a group of uniformed men gathered around a cannon, which was pointed at the sky, as if ready to fire, only waiting for someone to light the fuse. \"Are they planning to shoot the cannon at the building across from here?\" \"Hahahaha...\" Anna couldn't help but laugh at his genuine question. She wasn't used to guiding outsiders. \"You're not wrong, but they're planning to construct a new building here.\" \"Construct a new building?\" \"Yes, but since it hasn't take shape yet, I don't know what it will be.\" The cannon fired into the sky and thick clouds began to form above the clearing. Moments later, the water Anna called \"rain\" fell from the sky. \"Rain Water\" was a rare term that Artem only read about in the museum archives. He had never witnessed it before. It was a common weather condition in the Old World. Only snow would fall from the skies in Belobog. It's wasn't until this moment that Artem understood that the cold snowflakes at home could fall in such a gentle way. The Rain Water didn't disperse as it fell on the open ground. Instead, it quickly solidified into a concrete shape, as if sculpted by invisible hands. As the rain continued to fall, the outline of the building became clearer. The style was much different from those in Belobog. A building tens of meters high was completed before Artem's eyes in a matter of minutes, like a miracle. Anna was no longer surprised by the shock in Artem's eyes. She explained that all buildings in Frozen City were created from the miracle Rain Water. If the weather monitor Cloudship detected an incoming blizzard, these buildings would be converted to water on command, then transformed into new buildings as the people of Frozen City migrated to a more hospitable area. Unique blueprints were traded among residents. Strange buildings rose every day. There was nothing more natural to the locals than that. Chapter 2: Frozen City (II). \"Continuation: Following Anna, Artem witnessed the technological miracles of the Frozen City, including the Rain Water, frozen tunnel network, and many others. During the tour, Anna delivered the queen's invitation to Artem. He was being summoned as a foreign guest. This is how he'll get to meet Dalmir of the Lava Kingdom...\" Responding to the summon, Artem arrived at the Frozen City's Crystal Palace. He had no issues finding the place, as the palace's dome could be seen from anywhere in the streets. Under the guidance of the soldier in charge of the guest reception, Artem passed through the main hall and entered the most prized part of the Crystal Palace, the hall of history. The glimmering light of the dawning sun cast a delicate outline upon the corridor walls. Following Artem's footsteps, the sculptures of the ancient heroes and kings began to move. The spears in their hands extended forward, slowly reaching towards the evil monsters. Their cloaks swayed in the air, as if dancing alongside gusts of wind. however, all movement came to an end as Artem stoped. Artem had spent his fair share of time in museums. Trying to uncover stories hidden within the silent relics was part of his daily work. He was familiar with the techniques used by ancient artists and got use to ignoring symbolic adornments, so he could get right to the history itself. He couldn't help but slow down to gaze upon the magnificent works in the corridor: Emerging from the shattered sky, with golden blood running through their veins, the God looks down upon the mortal word with cold and condescending eyes... The warriors of the Frozen City were fighting the monster army. They wielded weapons emitting flames of death and wore armors that Artem has never seen before... An armed vehicle the size of a mountain soared through the air like a snowball. At the apex if this tidal wave of an army sat a woman with a diamond crown on her head. She was brandishing her spear, pointing it towards the merciless God in the sky... Artem almost collapsed under the power emitting from the sculpture. He exhaled and noticed that the soldier leading him was observing his fascination with a smile. Artem gave him an apologetic look and quickly caught up with the soldier. Artem was told by the soldier at the reception that he could move freely while waiting for the queen's summon. Not long after he sat down, a ragged outsider came in and sat next to him. Before Artem could speak, the man introduced himself. \"Hello, I'm Dalmir of the Lava Kingdom. I'd like to know...\" \"I'm Artem of Belobog. I'm not a guest, just an adventurer that ran into trouble.\" \"Belobog? I've never heard of it, but I'm glad to meet someone in the same line of work!\" \"Same line of work? What an unexpected joy! Judging from your clothes, you must have experienced many thrilling adventures.\" \"I guess thrilling would be an accurate description. I came here as a cannonball. It was eye-opening! I've never seen snowflakes before...\" \"What did you say? You came here... as a cannonball?\" \"Yeah, yeah! You put a man inside a cannon, the BOOM! The man's flying through the air, get it?\" Dalmir excitedly drew a parabola with his fingers. \"I don't get it. How could a man survive that?\" \"Here we go! This is my favorite moment. That incredible look on you face. Now I get to slowly explain my hometown to you. Haha, I'm used to it by now.\" Dalmir smiled proudly with his hands on his hips. \"There are no snowflakes in the Lava Kingdom where I'm from. The difference in temperature is night and day compared to the Frozen City. There are many volcanoes where I live. Do you know about volcanoes? It's the complete opposite of snow mountains. Volcanoes have smoke coming out the top, and sometimes, they even spew fire.\" Artem could not imagine a mountain so hot that ir could breathe fire. All he could do was nod absently. \"...And so, we used the power of the volcano to create a volcano cannon. We used it to launch adventurers, such as myself, to explore other countries. But it was only in the air that I realized the only way back was walking. I guess that's how the previous adventurers returned home, hahaha!\" Dalmir was naturally talkative. His words were full of passion that made Artem feel a sense of kinship. As they talked, Artem learned for the first what a volcano was, what the movement of the Earth's crust was, and what a volcano cannon was... The Lava Kingdom adventurers are dispatched to explore the ends of the earth, but they can always find their way back with a compass that always points home. However, the trip back may be more dangerous that being launched by the cannon, and only a handful of adventurers make it. The ones who do make it always bring home reliable companions from foreign lands. The outsiders bring knowledge and technology that the Lava Kingdom would not normally have access to. \"Artem, I need your help! Please come back with me to the Lava Kingdom. We must get there before the biggest volcanic event in history!\" \"The biggest volcanic event in history...?\" \"That's right! We're preparing out biggest volcano cannon yet. We're going to fly to the Satelleden of the Old World!\" Chapter 2: Frozen City (III). \"Continuation: After walking through the Frozen City's hall of history, Artem arrived at the reception room where he was greeted by Dalmir as he waited for the queen's summon. The two hit it off right away, and Dalmir shared his true reason for being here. He was searching for a companion to return to the Lava Kingdom with to soar into the skies together...\" Artem was once again blown away. His mind was like a drum head repeatedly pounded with new information. \"Leave the ground... and head for the skies?\" Each day, the world that Artem knew was repeatedly challenged by novel technologies, unknown histories, and distant, mysterious nations. Just as he thought nothing else would be able to surprise him, the man in front of him invited him to leave the land using a cannon powered by a volcano. He had no other choice... \"With all due respect, I refuse!\" \"What? I thought you'd be more adventurous than that. I was certain you would agree.\" \"Those are two completely different issues. Going to a far and unfamiliar nation or climbing to heights never reached before may sound crazy to some people, but those feats are all within human logic and understanding. Using a volcano to launch yourself into the sky... that's just suicide!\" After a short exchange, he bid his farewell to the adventurer from the volcano. \"Maybe it's not that ruthless of an idea, young man.\" He took but a few steps when a commanding and soothing voice came from the side. Only now did Artem notice a woman in expensive clothing staring at him from not too far. Based on what she was wearing, Artem immediately realized who it was and bowed. The woman smiled back. \"May I ask you a question? Adventurer from Belobog, why did you embark on this perilous journey?\" \"Perhaps... restlessness runs in my blood?\" Artem pondered for a moment, then shook his head. \"Perhaps life is too peaceful in Belobog. We hide in a greenhouse and listen to the preaching of the speakers day after day. Soldiers guard our borders, stopping monsters from entering our city and preventing our people from leaving. If you work hard, you don't have to worry about food or shelter. But every day is the same. Life is peaceful without any changes. People are afraid of an unstable future and losing the life to which they've grown accustomed. Belobog's history is hundreds of years old, but nobody has ever truly left.\" \"I don't want to read the same newspaper every day. I don't want to cover my eyes and ears and pretend the world is the size of our city. I want to know if I can survive a life that's not so peaceful.\" The woman smiled. \"It seems you were born in the wrong place. You are different from the other Belobog people I know.\" \"There have been other people of Belobog who arrived here?\" \"That was over a hundred years ago, and it ended regrettably. Fortunately, the Frozen City relocates constantly, and the disaster of war was avoided.\" Artem was listening to the words coming out of the woman's mouth in shock. \"You mean to say, Belobog and Frozen City almost went to war?\" \"From then on, we have been weary of all visitors from that country.\" The woman raised her hand to stop his questioning. \"As you can see, the Frozen City is not built from unchanging ice. It is built from water, free of prejudice.\" \"A man must be judged like a gem, by being examined from all sides. I have heard Anna's description of you. We have read about your adventures. And now, I have seen you. By the standards of the Frozen City, you are a remarkable man.\" \"I thank you for your kind judgment, Your Majesty.\" Artem lowers his head. \"Let's return to the topic at hand. I asked you before why you embarked on this perilous journey. Your response proved your wish to be free of constraints and live a life without a mundane routine. Frozen City, Lava Kingdom... You have heard and seen many wondrous things that most people can only dream of. But this city is bound to the skies, just as Belobog is bound to the land. Do you understand what I mean?\" \"I... understand, Your Majesty. I just have a hard time believing that people can fly through the air.\" Artem murmured, \"I thought only birds could do that. I can't tell if Dalmir's invitation is suicidal madness or an adventurous gamble.\" \"Is there any difference between the two? The spirit of adventure is a precious quality that goes against the humankind's natural survival instinct. It may seem worthless, but it is this spirit that allowed the people of the Old World to reach unimaginable heights. Strictly speaking, adventures and explorations are part of the heritage of the Old World.\" \"You wouldn't be able to see what the Frozen City looks like, if you had decided to live peacefully behind the Belobog walls. Dalmir was not lying when he mentioned the Satelleden. It is a miracle, located so high up that it's invisible to the naked eye, left behind by the Old World civilization. People have long forgotten what it was like nowadays,\" the Queen sighed regrettably. \"You've walked through the Snow Plains in search of ancient relics, all so that you could obtain the Old World heritage. The way back has already been covered in snow, Artem. The only way is forward, for you... and for the Frozen City, as it always has been.\" \"I will take that into consideration.\" Artem mused for a bit and let out a long sigh. \"I will go talk to Dalmir.\" Suddenly, the queen's face turned stern. \"I don't mean to persuade you, young Artem. Impulse will take you on adventures, but that alone will not take you to the ends of the earth. Regardless what you choose, I have a gift for you.\" The Queen extended her hands from beneath her cloak. She held out a one-cubit long wand to Artem. The wand was forked on one end, the shape of which resembled a double-headed eagle. \"Young Artem, we do not bow here in the Frozen City. But, as a token of respect towards the wisdom of the Old World, kneel down on one knee. Bow, not to me, but the Old World.\" The Queen took hold of the wand. Suddenly, liquid began to flow over the surface, forming a blueish ice blade. She turned the blade with incredible speed and touched Artem once on each shoulder and on the top of his head. Artem felt the ice breathing and jumping on his shoulders. \"May your path be clear, your luck persist, and your courage prevail.\" \"This blade's technology comes from the Old World. I present it to you, knight of the frozen city. To the sky, it is but a needle. To the earth, it is but a tool to cut through obstacles. But to you, it is the courage to move forward in the face of danger.\" \"Go now, Artem.\" Chapter 4: Spring Pasture (I). \"Continuation: This chapter talked about Artem and his two companions arriving at the warm grasslands after leaving the snowy mountains. Though the soil is rich and the plantations ample, the danger is still lurking in every corner of this pleasant place. Dangers such as never before seen gigantic insects...\" The fertile environment gave birth to vigorous growth. The soil beneath his feet felt like a soft mattress. Artem takes off his jacket and walks through the grass field with weeds as high as his knees. A soft breeze passes by with the scent of the fresh blades of grass. Artem never thought such a gentle wind existed in the world. He gently held on to Anna's hand, and she accepted his advance. For a split second, an idea passed through Artem's mind: \"Stay, and spend the rest of the life with Anna here.\" But he quickly cleared his head of the selfish thought when he looked at the girl who entrusted him with everything standing beside him. He would be letting her down if he were to follow his selfish urges. Before the three could enjoy more than just a sudden moment of peace, a rapid buzzing noise rose in the sky. The strange noise brought a prickling pain to their heads. A monster, like a bird, dashed through the sky flapping its glass-like transparent wings at astonishing speeds. Subconsciously, Dalmir covered his ears and dropped to the ground, and began praying to a certain god. After having experienced being taken by monsters, he has always been the first to react to similar dangers. Artem fought the pain in his eardrums as he covered Anna with his body and knelt to the floor. He realized that he might have seen monsters like these somewhere before. The dangers from the sky lands softly on the ground, retracting its mesh-like wings, and stood still like a horrific statue. Was that... a mosquito? Artem finally recalled from the depths of his memories the description he once read in an encyclopedia of the Old World regarding the monstrosity before him. In the Old World era, the world was divided into four distinct seasons. Mosquitoes were blood-sucking insects that emerged during the summer, but their size was no larger than an average fingertip and could be crushed with ease. However, the \"mosquito\" before him was taller than he was, and he could see individual hairs on its slender limbs. Its long and thin sword-like proboscis pierced in the ground as if it were sucking on something, completely oblivious to the three people standing around it. Lying flat on his stomach, Dalmir felt liquid moving below beneath the soft soil, as the giant mosquito's belly swelled up. There was fear in his lowered voice: \"Let's escape quickly before it discovers us...\" \"Yeah, be careful.\" Artem slowed down his breathing and moved slowly through the tall grass. But the nasty creature seemed to detect even the slightest tremor in the soil. In the blink of an eye, it retracted its proboscis and flew into the air. The faint hum came again, accompanied by a numbing headache. Artem brandished the sword that the queen of the Frozen City gave him and readied himself for battle. \"Be careful, Artem! It's coming.\" The high-pitched noise turned into a shrill scream as the creature approached. Artem parried the piercing attack from the mosquito's mouth with his sword. The creature was agile in the air, able to not only hover but quickly change directions. It flew back into the air and swooped down for another attack. Its movements were so fast that it became a blur. Before the attack could strike Artem, a roar of gunpowder sounded from behind him. The giant mosquito was knocked to the ground, with its feet in the air. Artem turned around to see Dalmir holding an ancient flintlock musket, with white smoke coming out of its barrel. \"Great shot!\" Dalmir was thrilled with the precision of his shot. But his excitement soon turned into fear as the creature kicked its feet to turn itself over. The giant mosquito turned upright and started flying back and forth in the air, enough to make someone dizzy. Artem could tell how angry it was by the fierce flapping of its wings. Its needle-sharp mouth quivered in preparation for its next attack. Artem's hand shook as he tried to hold on to the sword. This wasn't going to be an attack that could be dodged. \"Anna, get out of here!\" \"But, Artem...\" \"Escape? No need.\" A strong but powerful voice sounded from out of nowhere. Suddenly, a long lance appeared from the sky and pierced the semi-translucent body of the giant mosquito, pinning it to the ground. The battle was over in an instant. Artem let out a sigh of relief. They were saved. The man who spoke was dressed in strange imposing attire, looked majestic. What's more surprising was his mount: it was an insect with an armored shell, developed hind legs, and a saddle on its back. It was nearly the size of the giant mosquito that they just fought. The insect jumped up with lightning-quick speed. As it did, the man pulled his lance from the creature's corpse and stopped in front of Artem. He pointed it with precision at Artem's heart. He whistled, and a team of similarly dressed knights appeared from the grasses. The three of them were about to express their thanks when the first knight announced: \"Strangers trespassing on our sacred land, the Spring Weald. You are under arrest!\" Chapter 5: Water Prison (I). \"Continuation: In this chapter, Artem and friends discovered an altar that can be used to directly communicate with the giant monster \"Spring Weald\" and found out the entrance to its lungs. But what they found when they arrived in its lungs is an Old World rain forest with severe flooding. Artem and Duke dived into the water to find out the reason behind the flooding but was attacked and dragged into the depths...\" As Artem slowly woke, a mysterious feeling ran through him, as if he was freed from the weight of his body. He felt light, and the prolonged slumber provided a miraculous sense of security, just as what infants felt when they rest in the water of their mother's womb. He slowly regained consciousness but the drowsy feeling remained. Artem recalled the last thing that happened before passing out: He struggled to return to the surface as someone was dragging him down deeper into the water. He held out as long as he could before finally running out of air... Did I drown? There was no time for Artem to figure out what had happened because knowing what was going on was more important: He was completely submerged in water, however, there was not the slightest sense of grasping for air. He turned his wrist and confirmed the flow of water between his fingers. Then, his body began moving upwards as he started kicking his legs. \"Bam!\" his back hit the bars of the metal cage. The sudden pain made Artem swear out loud, but knowing that he was still alive put his mind at ease. \"Are you awake, Mr. Artem?\" A familiar voice came from behind. Artem. Swimming towards the sound, Artem discovered Captain Duke and the iron bars in the water between them. \"Captain Duke, you're alive as well? Where are we...\" \"We've been captured by the underwater residents.\" \"So that's how I passed out...\" \"No, you passed out because you were holding your breath. Haven't you noticed? We can breathe in this water.\" Artem suddenly understood. He was only alive because of this mysterious water. When he was a medical student, he learned that it was possible to breathe in water if enough oxygen was dissolved. It seems their conversation warranted a response from the nearby guard. A boyish figure swam past their cage. Dressed in tights with a harpoon in his hand, he banged hard on the iron bars with the harpoon, producing strong waves that sent Artem back. \"Shut up, this isn't a place for chitchat!\" The guard wasn't playing around: \"Where else would you breathe, besides in the water? You fools, come take a look at this.\" The guard pulled on the net in his hand. The thing he was dragging floated slowly into sight. There were white transparent sluggish worms. At least Artem thought they were worms, for he had never seen anything like them. \"Do you know where these bugs came from?\" Artem and Duke looked at each other and shook their heads. \"Hmph, useless creatures. I thought you two would know something...\" \"...These are bugs?\" \"I don't know, but I have to call it something.\" The guard suddenly remembered his position and struck the iron bars again, \"Silence! Don't talk to me!\" After a brief moment of silence, Artem asked the guard, \"It doesn't look like it has any internal organs. Maybe it's not a living organism?\" \"It chases people as if it has eyes. Who cares if it's living or not,\" snorted the Guard. \"When the body is split open, it releases a liquid that can dissolve people. You also can't breathe in the polluted water.\" \"Polluted... water...?\" Duke added coldly. \"So, instead of attacking them, you built this huge underwater prison...\" \"Hahaha, so you're the clever one. That fool beside you keeps asking stupid questions. Yes, two hundred layers of the prison below you are filled with these bugs.\" The guard's tone suddenly became serious: \"We must continue building the prison to survive.\" Artem tried to see the water below him. His eyesight was not as good as Duke's, but he could make out the staggering number of cages beneath him, where countless white bugs were indeed being held. However, the water was so deep that he could not see the bottom, only a deep abyss. The rising waters could have already crushed the insects near the bottom with sheer pressure, leaving only the smell of death in the abyss. Artem seemed to understand the real cause behind the flooding in the lungs of \"Spring Weald.\" The constant appearance of bugs and the expansion of the prison made the water in its lungs rise higher, leaving less room for oxygen. \"This prison wasn't meant for the two of you.\" The guard banged on the iron bars again. \"If you can help us find out where these bugs are coming from, we can let you out of here. How about it?\" \"What if I told you we were actually from above the water's surface?\" Chapter 6: Lava Kingdom (I). \"Continuation: In this chapter, Artem and friends arrived at the last stop in their voyage \u2014 The Lava Kingdom. Loud buzzing noises emerged from the distant lava and boulders responding to Dalmir's signal flares. A gigantic insect suited in plated armor arrives before them. It was their ride to the kingdom of cannons...\" Artem originally didn't have any negative feelings towards these invertebrate annelids. \"They've noticed the flare. Look, that's the molten insect. It's here to bring us home.\" A sense of joy and pride can be noticed in Dalmir's tone. \"Here for us? Another gigantic insect... there's too many bugs here.\" The gigantic earthworm-like bug stood roughly 2 meters tall and meters long. It continued to squirm as it was parked and waited to be boarded. Numerous layers of petal-shaped scales covered its circular muscles. The scales were coated in a special layer of fine black granite sand which looks to be made of part secretion and part lava. Artem was reluctant to board this worm and stood still. \"What's wrong, Artem? This is not as strange as the bugs back on the Spring Weald.\" \"Let's go, Artem.\" Anna followed after Dalmir. An old man was standing above the rings of muscle. He was holding a long pole in his hand. In his other hand... was an iron hook, holding onto something like a bridle. He jumped off the back of the giant bug with style. The old man spread out his arms and embraced Dalmir. It was clear that they weren't just acquaintances, but great buddies. \"Hey! Dalmir!\" \"President Barbicane! You came to see me!\" \"Hahahaha, surprised, are you? Quickly, introduce me to your adventure companions!\" \"Hello, I'm Anna.\" \"Hello, Anna! I'm Barbicane. Hahaha, this girl is adorable!\" Barbicane, seeing that Artem hadn't moved, walked towards him, shouting at the top of his voice. \"You, young lad over there! Come quickly. We are heading back to the Lava Kingdom!\" Artem, seeing the old man limping over to him and grabbing his hand, reluctantly followed. \"...Hello, I'm Artem.\" After climbing on the huge molten insect, it was as Artem had feared. The metal armors on its back didn't fit well on the worm. There was nothing Artem could hold onto, except the arms of the seat. He clamped his legs tightly to keep himself from falling off this loose carapace. There was the sound of an electrode at the end of Barbicane's pole, as he looked back at the people seated behind him. \"Off we go!\" The giant worm squirmed with the shock from Barbicane's pole. With the rhythmic contractions and relaxation of the ringed muscles, the worm moved forward faster and faster. Sitting between Anna and Dalmir, Artem thought this was a marvelous way to travel. The distance between them changed slightly every time the worm's muscles relaxed and contracted. Without a doubt, there were some unexpected advantages to this special mode of transportation. The large worm and its armor can be compressed to a certain extent, allowing it to crawl through the tunnels. It can go around some smaller volcanic vents, and also climb on rock walls that others would have to circle. Barbicane used complex static signals to control the worm, and the worm made some delicate maneuvers of its own. The two of them were like parts in a well-oiled machine, achieving some impossible movements together. Artem also noticed the unique way the large worm dissipated heat. A sticky liquid would flow out from the small reticular holes in its armor. The burning sand would then fall off its carapace, while new clay and sand would stick to it from the fresh liquids, thus taking away the heat from the armor. \"How incredible...\" As the journey continued, Dalmir and Barbicane's conversation about the Lava Kingdom grew more interesting. According to Dalmir, half of the adventurers in the Lava Kingdom loved building cannons, while the other half loved adventures. Barbicane is the president of the Lava Kingdom Cannon Development Committee, a fine example of how obsessed they are with cannon technology. The only thing they could boast about was the size of the cannon or its firing range. \"In our committee, people respect you based on the might of your cannon. Dalmir is only interested in making flintlocks. We're not interested in that, hahaha!\" \"Hey! I'm a professional adventurer! Hahahaha!\" President Barbicane's boorish laugh gave everyone around him a sense of kinship. He was missing an eye, and one of his hands and one leg were replaced by metal prosthetics. It wasn't until he turned to talk to Dalmir that Artem noticed part of his skull was also made from some kind of silicon. \"What happened to my skull? I lost a chunk of it when the cannon blew up! But it didn't turn me into a slow thinker, haha!\" As Artem got used to the bumpy ride, he finally had time to enjoy the sights. There were many volcanoes of varying sizes all looking like they were about to burst. Lava and magna were everywhere, and Artem felt scorching hot just looking at them. Any normal human would think the environment was just too harsh. It wouldn't be completely inaccurate to say this place was hell on earth. The black volcanoes, smoke-filled skies, red lava spewing everywhere... Who would have imagined there'd be a country here focused on the scientific research of cannons? \"It's been a long time since any adventurers returned. I've asked our cook to prepare a celebration feast tonight!\" Artem was excited that there would be a celebration. Only Anna, who had been watching the volcano in the distance, seemed to be preoccupied with something. The banquet hall was full of people from the Cannon Development Committee and the Explorers' Guild. President Barbicane's passionate introduction of the three of them was met with thunderous applause. Artem noticed something: everyone was missing a body part, whether it be an arm or a leg. Some of them even had a rubber chin or a platinum nose. From Artem's perspective, it was a miracle that Dalmir's body was completely intact. \"For years now, our Cannon Committee has been planning the greatest cannon event, one that's worthy of our ancestors! Everyone is aware that the greatest volcanic activity in history is coming!\" \"Viva the volcanoes!\" The banquet hall filled up with loud cheers once more. \"We will bravely shoot ourselves into outer space, risking our lives for the greatest adventure the world has ever known!\" \"Viva the outer space!\" The whole banquet hall shook as if it would collapse at any moment. \"Positional observations from Dalmir's journey have allowed us to track the Satelleden. I am pleased to announce that we can now reach it with complete certainty using cannon!\" Many people were shocked at the announcement, evident by the sudden silence in the hall. Then, it was followed by cheering and applause that couldn't be suppressed, even if all the cannons in the banquet hall were fired at once. Artem sneaked away from the crowd of people in the banquet hall. He saw Anna looking out of the window at the quiet volcano in the distance. Besides her, it was the sparkling wine they had brought from the Spring Weald. \"Anna...\" \"Artem, don't say anything. Can you come here for a moment?\" During their adventures, Artem had witnessed Anna's extraordinary tenacity a thousand times. But now, her voice sounded like a distress signal, pleading to him for help. Her soft breathes seemed to be conveying a desire to make him stay. It made Artem want to embrace her from behind. \"What's wrong?\" \"If you go to outer space, will you ever come back again...?\" \"Perhaps, there probably won't be volcano cannons in the Satelleden.\" \"Artem...\" Anna turned around and her face flushed as if she had cried. At that moment, the sounds from the banquet hall faded away and the whole world fell silent. \"I miss home. Will you come home with me?\" Chapter 6: Lava Kingdom (II). \"Continuation: Artem and his friends arrive in the Lava Kingdom on the back of a molten insect. They were greeted with the warmth. After hearing the kind speech of the president of the Lava Kingdom Cannon Development Committee, Barbicane, they realized that their arduous journey was nearing its end, but Anna wanted to quit and wished Artem could stay as well...\" Dalmir was confused, but he didn't dare ask any questions. There was a delicate feeling in the air between Artem and Anna by the second day of the celebration. Dalmir speculated that Artem saw the uplifted feelings of the festival as an opportunity and confessed his love for Anna, but was ultimately turned down. He had always believed the two would end up together, but reality has shown him how naive he was. If he had launched from the cannons and seen more of the world, maybe he would've seen it coming. \"Umm... I brought you guys to the launching grounds here today to show you our pride, the volcano cannon.\" Dalmir was aware that the two were not in a good mood, but he thought that it would be best not to ask. \"As I've said before, the energy of the volcano is the energy of the planet itself.\" \"The core of the planet is alwats pushing towards the opposite direction of gravity and not sitting at the center of this planet. This enormous outward compression force shoots out the lava and other gases from beneath the ground. This is the power of the volcano...\" Artem and Anna looked upon the distant lava in the main volcano through the thick glass. It's characteristics were similar to ocean waves, rising and falling. On the other hand, it was like boiling water, with gases constantly pushing out of the magma and forming bubbles that soon bursted. The scorching temperatures heated the air unevenly and caused heat hazes to appear. Anyone could see that such an unstable, burning, and bright liquid could not be suppressed for much longer. Without realizing it, Artem was sweating all over. \"Instability, unpredictability, and too much power were all reasons that humans in the past could not harness this energy. However, our ancestors changed their minds during the Ice Age.\" \"Don't try to control it. Set it free!\" \"You're right, Artem! We should just set this immense energy free like...\" They said in unison, \"Like one big fart!\" The two of them laughed. Dalmir had told many cheesy jokes like this during their journey. It wasn't until they were staring at the ready-to-erupt volcano that the foolish explanations came to live. It was unbelievable that they are standing so close to such outlandish descriptions. Artem feels like he's still in a dream. Anna laughed lightly as she walked behind them. \"The energy containter at the top and the volcanic accelerators over there... They're too expensive to make, but they are all disposable...\" Dalmir suddenly stopped. He wasn't pleased with that expression. \"They've prepared their whole lives for the one battle, but it only takes one battle to prove everything. They aren't disposables! They're the ultimate romanticists!\" \"...Romanticists...? Artem felt as if something was stirring inside his chest like restless magma. As Dalmir's voice grew quieter, he could feel the vibrations of the mantle, all that immense energy to realize the once-in-a-lifetime romance. \"Look over here! This is the cannonball we'll be riding in!\" It was a spherical cockpit about seven meters in diameter, with wide windows in the front. There were countless precise instruments, levers, and buttons inside. On the outside, there were a pair of thin wings that could open out... It didn't look like anything from the Lava Kingdom. \"Could it be...\" \"That's right. It was a cannonball created by the people from the Old World. This is the only one in the whole world!\" The outside was covered with material that can withstand temperatures up to 5000 degrees Celcius. Telemetry communications, energy, temperature control, and other precision equipment lined the walls of the interior. Artem had unearthed many Old World relics to know immediately that this was the pinnacle of Old World technology, something that could take people to outer space for real. \"This cannonball is also a romanticist, flying into outer space with no return. It will complete its mission during the journey then float through the universe as a permanent fixture...\" Once again, Artem felt he was no longer on the ground. He was among the brilliant stars that filled the night sky. Anna looked at the man standing before her, knowing that his mind had already left this planet. She understood completely. Artem's heart had reached the heights of the firmament that she couldn't reach, no matter how hard she tried. It was far, far beyond the Satelleden, far beyond the end of the universe. And so, she decided to leave quietly before dawn. Perhaps it would make him less miserable. But she still couldn't do it. \"Thank you, Anna.\" On the path before sunrise, she saw a clear silhouette\u2014it was Artem, waiting for her. She couldn't leave quietly after all. \"I have been deeply in love with you ever since you saved my life. I have never seen such a tenacious, independent, and gentle woman like you. There were plenty of chances for me to tell you: I like you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" \"But I cannot stay with you. If there's one thing that I must do in life, it is to go on adventures, continuous adventures. I'm sorry...\" \"I think I'm also a romanticist. I'm willing to risk everything I have for the sake of adventure. I'm sorry...\" With tears in her eyes, Anna knew. She knew the moment she embarked on this journey. It was the kind of man she fell in love with. Before her tears could fall, a warm hand wiped away her tears. It was Artem's hand, which she knew all too well. \"I don't want you to shed so many tears for me. But I've already decided...\" \"I understand. I understand completely...\" \"I can only give you three things.\" Artem took out his journey, which carefully recorded all his adventures and memories with Anna. \"The first is my past. Everything we experienced together was real.\" Artem placed the sword that the Frozen City Queen had given him in Anna's hands. \"The second is my future. This is my promise to the queen. I wish to protect you forever.\" \"and the last is my present. I love you, Anna.\" He kissed her. They were so affectionate as if time had stopped at this moment and the future would not come. Final Chapter - Satelleden (I). \"Continuation: In this chapter, armed with a conviction of never returning, Artem and Dalmir will ride a \"cannonball\" of the Old World into the sky\" The impact factor of the volcano cannon was not included in the original designs. The \"cannonball\" instantly reached a shocking speed upon firing, leaving everyone at the launch site speechless. Is this really going to be okay? From the inside, Artem and Dalmir had to withstand 10 g's of crushing force. They were almost smashed by the power. Artem lost consciousness the split-second upon launch and the memories of the dangers on the Snow Plains appeared in his mind. His lulled state did not last long as he woke himself up with impressive conviction and mental discipline. After experiencing the near-death moment, Artem immediately noticed the importance of the shock-reduction capacitator in the flying pod. Without it, he'd already be dead. Dalmir on the other hand was having a much harder time. His eyes were rolled back and white foam was coming out of his slightly opened mouth. Is he passed out? Or is he... gone? Artem called for him over the radio several times, but Dalmir did not respond. Not only could the approaching space be seen in the porthole of the \"cannonball,\" but so could the distancing ground from beneath. The spectacular view unfolds rapidly in front of Artem's eyes. The familiar sights quickly shrink till it becomes unfamiliar. The numbers on the instruments continue to climb, with no sign of slowing down whatsoever. Artem was still unaware of what was happening even though everything pointed towards the same conclusion \u2014 They were leaving the planet at shocking speeds. \u2014 They were 5000 meters off the ground. Artem could still see the buildings of the Lava Kingdom, especially the main cannon that fired the \"cannonball.\" The launch caused a massive landslide, reducing the main volcano to a billowing cloud of smoke. At this height, the large molten insects were impossible to see and the lava on the ridges looked like a spider silk web. The bright colors that scorched the eyes had softened considerably. The volcanic ash in the air sped by quickly, as the ground slowly became a blur. \u2014 10,000 meters off the ground. Artem could see the Spring Weald. At the height of tens of thousands of meters, Artem could barely see the back of the beast. Even so, he had not seen the monster's entire body! Such a giant beast! It was an indescribable feeling to have a panoramic view of the roads he had taken on during his long adventures. Artem traced the route he had once taken on, saw through the snowy mountains, and looked at the blizzard. The Frozen City was within the quickly passing clouds and snow, and he could barely see its outline. Anna once said she would go fishing with her father to relax at the end of long adventures. How would she relax this time... Thin clouds began to obstruct his view and thoughts of escaping came back. How long has this \"cannonball\" been flying... \u2014 They flew higher until they reached the darkness. Belobog loomed over the dark land. Belobog loomed over the dark land. Thousands of lit houses were only the size of a coin, but Artem knew that it was Belobog. The urban heat island effect stood out against the surrounding chill, which was more evident when looking down from the clouds. It was this warmth that had sustained Belobog for a hundred years, but it also prevented its people from going outside. Compared to the size of the planet, Belobog was but a speck of dirt. Artem once thought that Belobog and its surroundings was the entire world. Thinking back now, it was just the unwillingness to admit his narrow perspective. At this height, anyone would agree that such a narrow perspective was laughable. \u2014 100,000 meters off the ground. Artem could clearly see the curvature of the planet. Artem could clearly see the curvature of the planet. The great auroras started appearing. The brilliant ribbons gently covered the surface of the planet. Back in Belobog, Artem had gazed up at these dreamlike veils fluttering in the night sky. Now, they were below him. It was at this moment that static came through the communication device... \"...A\u2014Artem! We! Ahhhh! Are in the sky! Ahhhhh... Ahhh...\" It was Dalmir's screaming from earlier. Artem really didn't know whether to laugh or cry. \u2014 400,000 meters off the ground. Artem could see the Satelleden. It was a large cylindrical object, rotating slowly. Artem had heard of science fantasies that the effects of gravity could be simulated through centrifugal force. He brushed it off as mere fantasy until witnessing the miracle before his eyes. The excitement was overwhelming. I wonder how people from the Old World will react when they see this \"cannonball.\" Fear? Surprise? Will they be treated like invaders and face retaliation? Soft music began playing in the \"cannonball.\" It was a mix of drums and guitars that make you feel warm and cozy, like a gift at the end of their journey: \"Distant cosmic radio is calling\" \"Distant cosmic radio is calling\" As the \"cannonball\" got closer, Artem could make out more details of the Satelleden. If the interior was spread out, \"Satelleden\" would be a large rectangular area. The opposite sides of the area would join to form the cylinder. Anywhere you stood, you could raise your head and see the streets hanging above. In the streets, many buildings violated physics. The mechanical giants appeared to be connecting the building blocks by combining various modules. Neatly planned streets kept adjusting their positions. To Artem, the whole \"city\" was breathing and pulsing like a living organism and rotating as a Rubik's Cube. It was constantly evolving, showing ultimate rationality. As an immaculate work of art that had long been abandoned, \"Satelleden\" was floating alone in the universe, awaiting the gaze of human admiration. As if sensing the \"cannonball,\" the large object extended a docking port of the same astonishing proportions, like a giant extending its hand at a flying insect. Artem's heart clenched out of fear that the last moments of his journey would end in a fiery collision. But the disaster he imagined didn't happen. The docking port gently held the \"cannonball\" and guided it to the landing pad in Satelleden. The music was still playing gently on their communication devices... \"I climb the ladder to the stars\" \"And walk in the gallery of outer space\" \"Insomnia awaits the galaxy tonight\""}

Chapter 1: Calamity Ensnares Commission of Alchemy. And the Alchemy Commission was plagued with threats internal and external \u2014 the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were wreaking havoc within, while Abominations and the Ambrosial Arbor loomed beyond. Seeing the crisis, (Trailblazer) yet laughed loudly at the companions behind them. The heroes were confused as to the reason of the laughter, and (Trailblazer) calmly explained \u2014 \"I laugh at the folly of these Abominations of Abundance, and at idiocy of the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.\" cupped their hands in praise \u2014 \", you couldn't have said it better! I have heard of your fierce battle against the Ruin Legion on \"Ya Li Luo-VI\" \u2014 even with the help of the Doomsday Beast, the Legion could not escape an overwhelming defeat. And now, these Abominations and demon have schemed and plotted, yet the best they could summon was an Ebon Deer that stands no chance against a mighty warrior such as you!\" The companions exchanged smiles, their morale renewed afresh. At this moment of high spirits, they heard a whooshing sound in the distance \u2014 the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus wielded colossal crossbows, firing a steady stream of projectiles in a play to catch the companions off guard. casually caught the flying arrows, and tossed them back to their owners! Screams and screeches rose in tandem, for these dishonorable scoundrels were now having a taste of their own medicine. and looked at each other and instantly shared the same thought: \"We must not let others look down on the two of us.\" Then, they worked their internal qi, made a double jump onto the air to fly up, and pounced on the enemy. Of course, the chaos that ensued is another story altogether! Chapter 2: Nameless Battles Author of Plagues. It was said that the Ebon Deer had a hide of iron and hooves of bronze, impervious to sword and spear. Its eyes glowed like burning lamps, and its cry whistled through the air like the wailing of a terrible ghost. Any ordinary person who encounters such a monster will surely be scared out of their wits. (Trailblazer) and companions, however, were not fazed in the least. Esteemed audience, can you guess why? Because the four heroes in this story each have their own special abilities and unique skills, and the fighting spirit and endurance to match. Defeating the wicked beast of Abundance was but a moment's effort for our heroes! For it is said that stood eight feet tall and spanned eight feet across the waist. When they lowered their head to look down upon the Ebon Deer, it was akin to a giant looking at a child. They had cultivated their martial skills to perfection \u2014 the sharpest of blades are futile against such a person. Seeing that its antlers could not gore the hero, the Deer stomped its bronze hooves on the ground with a howl, and branches of the Ambrosial Arbor sprouted out in all directions, firmly wrapping around 's limbs. For a time, the two were at a standstill. It was at this moment that entered the melee. They raised their giant fists, the size of an aurumaton's hands, and pounded relentlessly. The monster's hide was thick, but a moment had not passed before the shock from 's heavy blows delivered grave internal injuries, and blood flowed from its nostrils. As most can guess, internal injuries don't always have external manifestations \u2014 though there was nary a scratch on the skin of the beast, its insides were already beaten to a rotten pulp. The Ebon Deer would not last more than a few years with such wounds. But (Trailblazer) knew well such a monstrosity, though mortally wounded, could not be allowed to roam freely and terrorize the citizenry. With a gesture from, sprung into action, the sword in their hand spinning as it dispatched the vines grappling . With a flash of the sword and flick of the wrist, dashed straight towards the enemy, and sent the Ebon Deer to the ground with just one blow! As it turned out, the beast was susceptible to fire, and knew how to use it well. Quick as a lightning flash, this monster that had stricken fear in countless Clouds Knights fell to the ground at the hands of our heroes, never to rise again! Chapter 3: Traveler Treasures Heart of Scions. It was said the High Elder (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) was the living embodiment of nature's pinnacle and the breathing epitome of heaven's zenith, and was set by divine destiny to be born into this mortal world. (Trailblazer) reckons \"a diamond must be cut and polished before it can shine \u2014 without a wise teacher and good friends, (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) could well join the dark side and follow in the footsteps of the predecessor, Imbibitor Lunae.\" Though (Trailblazer) had no blood relation to the High Elder, they had the responsibility to raise the High Elder. And so, summoned their four companions to inquire about how to best educate the young (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe), desirous of giving him a bright future. said: \"This is the future leader of the Vidyadhara \u2014 if he has not mastered the art of warfare and combat, how can he live up to the mandate of heaven or claim earthly glory? How will he maintain his authority? It is known that General Jing Yuan excels in the art of war and is the Sword Champion's disciple. Why shouldn't the general be the teacher?\" said: \"That won't do! How can the cultivation of an outstanding talent be confined to violence? It's known that Master Diviner Fu Xuan's omniscia spares none. She is a genius at tactics and strategy and is also literate and eloquent to a fault. Besides, she enjoys all pedagogical endeavors. If Master Diviner Fu can be the teacher, (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) will become adept in the ways of the cosmos and of worldly affairs!\" shook their head heavily: \"It's said you need a famous teacher to train a great student \u2014 how can a hero be cultivated by such mediocre characters? If I may offer a better suggestion \u2014 There is a certain genius named Madam Herta, whose space station orbits The Blue. She has even gained the favor of Nous the Wisdomwalker and reached the level of becoming their Emanator. Her domain, the space station, is home to 72 sages, three thousand researchers, and more Curios than could ever be counted! (Trailblazer) could inform Herta that (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) is a Curio from far across the stars and ask for her audience this way. When you meet her, convince her with rarity and appeal to her with cuteness. That would surely pique Madam Herta's curiosity and make her eager to become (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s teacher.\" sat and pondered deeply with their eyes downcast, and after a few moments looked up and said: \"As the saying goes, 'You are the company you keep.' I heard that on \"Ya Li Luo-VI\" there is a child prodigy named Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, who is wise beyond her years \u2014 she even recruited persons of upstanding character to form a gallant group called The Moles. Being tutored by an adult would surely spoil (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s childlike innocence and simplicity \u2014 why not entrust him to The Moles and let him grow into his own person in a natural way, spending his childhood in careless play? So, what does (Trailblazer) think? When it comes to pre-school education, aren't the Moles the best? After all, the Moles are supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\" After hearing everyone's eager contributions of balderdash, (Trailblazer) firmly believed that with the combined efforts of their companions and (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s innate talent, they would surely be able to raise (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) as an outstanding High Elder of the Vidyadhara. Chapter 4: Dragonlord Commands Wrath of Seas. After (Trailblazer) completed the trial and found the dragon egg under the guidance of the wise Vidyadhara spirits, (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) descended and subsequently provided powerful support for the group. The people often saw a heroic and dashing carrying out justice together with an adorable child, who wielded a long lance and stood floating on fortuitous clouds. This hero also joined hands with many a valiant leader on the Luofu and beyond, determined to eradicate the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and the evil of the Ambrosial Arbor. One day (Trailblazer) and (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) came to Scalegorge Waterscape and gazed there upon the shimmering waters of the vast ancient sea, like a drop of empyreal jade, where all things that ever were are lost to the billowing waves. It should be known that the Vidyadhara are born from the ancient sea, and to the ancient sea they are destined to return. The sight of their old home filled (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) with elation, and they could hardly wait to put down the lance, untie their red silk sash at their waist, and go frolic at the water's edge. Being of the dragon race, visiting the water gives the Vidyadhara quietude, clarity, and even epiphany. The young High Elder began playing with their red silk sash in the sea, enjoying the water as if it were second nature. However, it unintentionally started to cast a cloudhymn, its magical notes stirring this heavenscape into gloomy darkness and lifting giant waves into the air. The Abominations hiding nearby could not endure the relentless barrage, and they came out in droves expecting to face the wrath of an earth-shattering giant. Instead, they saw a small child, and they were filled with an indomitable rage: \"If this small child is already capable of such feats, how can we hope to survive when they are fully grown!?\" And then these fiends born from the Arbor showed their claws and approached (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe), vowing to exterminate the hatchling right there and then. (Trailblazer) rose up anxiously to protect the young one, shouting: \"Harm not my child!\" Yet (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) remained calmed and composed, and simply shouted: \"Part!\" With the raising of (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s red sash, the tides of Scalegorge Waterscape moved as though they were alive, obeying the command to part and never to close back. The Abominations, with their murderous fury, were all pulled into the bottomless ravine between the waters \u2014 even their bones were torn out of existence! If any of you have the opportunity to visit Scalegorge Waterscape, the tide that parted and never closed back is a living testament to the unfathomable power of this little Vidyadhara! Chapter 5: Xianzhou Laments Woes of Age. Ladies and gentlemen, it is important to know that when a divine weapon takes shape, it is often heralded by extraordinary signs. Mountains crumble, rivers run dry, and blood-soaked rain accompanies the wailing of ghosts. Without such phenomena, its divine nature would not be revealed. Through countless hardships, (Trailblazer) had forged (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth\/Big Sword\/Reaper of Nexus Modder\/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon). As it emerged into the world, the heavens and earth grew solemn, delves trembled, and the balance of the Meridian Pin faltered. Whether it be the craftmasters of the Artisanship Commission or the plants and trees of the Alchemy Commission, all sentient beings with or without emotions rejoiced at the birth of this weapon capable of vanquishing Lord Ravagers. Yet, they also keenly sensed the profound death and destruction it will bring forth in the future. At this moment, sorrow filled the hearts of plants and trees, and tears flew from young and old alike. Even the renowned Master Gongshu, who was accustomed to witnessing the creation of exceptional weapons, couldn't help but exclaim when he sensed the murderous aura emanating from the divine weapon: \"In the current ranking of armaments on Xianzhou, (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth\/Big Sword\/Reaper of Nexus Modder\/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon) deserves to be at the forefront!\" (Trailblazer) was intrigued by his words and asked, \"I am but a simple and ignorant one. Pray tell, good sir, if there be talk of an armament ranking, surely there must be other marvels of weaponry aboard the Xianzhou that are worthy of my attention!\" \"When it comes to divine armament and marvels of weaponry, I am indeed the expert. Allow me to share some insights with the .\" \"In terms of sheer power, it is undoubtedly the Devastator Glaive wielded by General Jing Yuan. This weapon was crafted from the remnants of the Lux Arrow, which was shot by the Reignbow to extinguish the embers of fallen stars. It weighs a staggering 13,500 catties! When held in the general's hand, it may appear like an ordinary Cloud Knight's glaive of moderate length. But when unleashed in its full glory, held by the divine empyreanite summoned by the general, this weapon defies the heavens and the earth. A single strike has the power to sunder mountains and cleave peaks!\" \"When it comes to sapience, the foremost recommendation is the spherical astrolabe wielded by the esteemed master diviner. This wondrous artifact resembles a wheel, constantly rotating. Embedded within it are 108 jade abaci, attuned to the profound patterns of the Matrix of Prescience. It can divine fortunes and evil, discern auspicious and ominous signs, and unveil the most prudent courses of action. Truly, it is a brilliant beacon illuminating the nebulous mysteries of pasts and futures! A treasure, indeed!\" \"When it comes to precision, there is only one that stands out \u2014 the Bow of Spirit wielded by Madam Yukong, the Helm Master of the Sky-Faring Commission. When the bowstring is drawn, it becomes one with the archer, guiding the darting arrows unerringly to their targets, piercing hearts with every shot!\" Upon hearing this, (Trailblazer) was filled with joy. \"So many awe-inspiring marvels of weaponry are aboard the Xianzhou and yet none of them are put to good use. You see, they are a gift. A gift to the foes of evil. Why not use these weapons? One does not simply lock away their precious.

Consider it a collector's item. Treasure it!)\" Chapter 6: Trailblazer Fails Sanctum of Exaltation. Though Phantylia, the master primus of all evil, was eliminated, the Ambrosial Arbor it poisoned was on the verge of losing control. This towering plant sprouted rapidly, and the Abominations of Abundance hiding in its branches and veins poured into the human realm as they gained bodies of corporeal flesh and blood. (Trailblazer) knew that, should the Ambrosial Arbor be allowed to grow to its full, the Xianzhou Luofu shall be reduced to a ship of the dead. Faced with veritable tsunamis of Abominations of Abundance, (Trailblazer) signaled the band of heroes to retreat while providing cover for them. At that precipitous moment, yelled: \"(Will this blow pierce through the stars?\/I'll be back!\/Oops, was it my line?\/Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!)\" Like a lightning bolt that slammed into the ground, the light that exploded out of (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth\/Big Sword\/Reaper of Nexus Modder\/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon) engulfed all, stabbing toward and tearing apart the Ambrosial Arbor, destroying the very sky itself. For a moment, the ground toppled and the sky trembled in the Xianzhou's countless delves, as if the Reignbow had returned to shoot down stars, as if the death of the divine wood sent up a cataclysmic dust storm. After the clouds dissipated a few days later and the Xianzhou returned to peace, the Cloud Knights guarding the Arbor sought unceasingly for (Trailblazer) and yet could not find a single trace of them, just like the ephemeral theophany of the Reignbow. When General Jing Yuan heard the news, he could not help but lament and shed tears worthy for a hero. However, though the general is wise, he did not divine that legendary characters such as (Trailblazer) will never die in the company of demons and crowns. Blessed by the Cloudstrider, (Trailblazer) had already left the devastation and quietly started on a new hero's journey. The Ruin Legion still ravages the starry seas, and the worlds waiting for salvation are endless. The legend of the heroes of the Trailblaze continues on! As it is said:Serene was the Xianzhou, free from harm. Quiet was the palace, rich in charm.Until the demons breached the gate, leaving the palace bloodied by fate.Then comes a, tall and strong. Flesh and iron, seven feet long.Evil minions fall to might. Under staff, they bleed in flight.Mounting the clouds, pursues all foes. Riding the dragon, purges all woes.Towards the sky, splits through. Onto the arbor, strikes true."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=13279","text":"Talia Talia is a planet referenced in the relic sets and Wastelander of Banditry Desert. It is currently inaccessible. History. Talia was originally an occupied planet. Little remains of its culture, but it once housed a monastery with friars, and a rodent race who built underground tunnels. It is not known what fate these civilizations met. Eventually, Talia was left unoccupied and came to be known as the \"Starry Junkyard\" or \"Junkyard of the Galaxy\". The wars of the past brought ruins and wreckage to the surface and caused perpetual radiation, making it unsuitable to host life. However, at one point Interstellar Thieves accidentally landed on the planet while trying to evade a Galaxy Ranger and discovered a tunnel left beneath the surface by the rodent race. After having escaped the Ranger, they eventually discovered a massive labyrinth of underground caverns, and decided to use Talia as a base to establish their Kingdom of Banditry. Renowned thieves promised to use the treasury of Talia to build a nation of equity and fairness. At one point, an alliance market was established. But as the amount of accumulated wealth grew larger and larger, the same thieves attempted to monopolize all the wealth. This led to a chaotic age where groups of thieves seized water resources and built their own towns. The war eventually migrated from the underground to the surface, and the occupants of Talia came to be known as the Wastelanders. At some point, a nuclear blast occurred on Talia, filling the atmosphere with sand and dust, and blocking out the sun. The bandits of Talia fashioned gear and armour from interplanetary junk, driving off-road vehicles and fighting with rival cohorts for resources. Most of them were illiterate. Eventually, the need for defense of their town led the wasteland engineers from Nailscrap Town to develop Sensory Technology."}

This exposed wire was old. It had once been neatly lined up on a starship until one hasty escape attempt of the starship led to a huge shock wave, which subsequently exposed the wire to the moisture in the air. The entire starship was dragged into a labyrinth of underground passages. On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds... This exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source. The top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion. This naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently. It was an old gangster who claimed to be the \"police officer\" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival. There was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2191","text":"Talia's Nailscrap Town Talia's Nailscrap Town is a Relic piece in the set . Description. It was by pure accident that the interstellar thieves came to Talia in their hasty escape from the pursuit of the Galaxy Ranger. At first, Talia was just a desolate place known by many as the \"Starry Junkyard\". The planet-destroying wars of the past brought mountains upon mountains of ruins and wreckage onto the surface of Talia, resulting in imperishable radiation and taking away the last remaining hope to sustain life. The thieves had nowhere else to go and fell into a cave beneath the surface of the planet, which turned out to be a tunnel left by the rodent race... The thieves managed a narrow escape, and their dream of establishing a Kingdom of Banditry was thus discreetly born in this lost realm of seclusion. Innumerable caverns were interconnected in a massive labyrinth. More groups of thieves and bandits were lured in by this supposed dreamland meant for them and came to accumulate wealth and exchange technology, subsequently laying the foundation for the kingdom. As more and more thieves and bandits settled down here, the once desolate planet became extraordinarily bustling with life. Thieves of great renown spoke of their ideal of a Kingdom of Banditry, promising to use the treasury to build a nation of equity and fairness. But as the amount of accumulated wealth grew larger and larger, the same thieves tore up their flimsy promises right away and attempted to monopolize all the wealth. Mercenaries, riots, double crossings, and betrayals... Chaos ensued one after another. Perhaps the initiators never even once believed in their ideal of so-called equity for all. Henceforth, thieves who resented lofty ideals found themselves in a chaotic age where ignorance was glorified. They seized water sources to build towns of their own and mocked the very idea of fairness and justice. Everyone in Nailscrap Town was a bandit. They drove violently destructive off-road vehicles and fought for resources with other hordes of bandits in the desert. They created mechanical armor and weapons out of scrap iron and old wires... The more barren the wasteland was, the more freedom they got out of it, like one final frenzy before doomsday. Those sweet dreams were like wisps of nonsense in the radiating heat waves and had long ceased to leave any trace behind. In a half-awake trance, the thieves came to the realization that the Kingdom of Banditry was never about creation but about destruction."}

Tayzzronth is an Aeon motivated by nothing but the need to propagate and spread across the universe. THEY were responsible for the rise of The Swarm, and it's eventual spread throughout the universe. Appearance. Tayzzronth appears as large insect with six legs and two large wings. On the top of THEIR main body is a faceless puppet-like humanoid with two small wings on THEIR back. When appearing in Simulated Universe, a loud screech can be heard, accompanied by the fluttering of wings. In the distance, more cries can be heard. History. Ascension. Tayzzronth hailed from the planet Lepismat where THEY were the last of the Coleoptera after a war between the Elydichnan army and a group of \"bounty hunters\". Feeling intense loneliness for THEIR species, Tayzzronth ascended as the Aeon of Propagation, splitting the Path of Permanence from then deceased Aeon Long. War between Aeons. In 13XX AE, Tayzzronth and The Swarm began their spread across the universe. One day, the Aeon Oroboros appeared before THEM and this provoked a war between the two, which effected two-thirds of life in the universe. Oroboros opened THEIR mouth and swallowed numerous heirs of Tayzzronth along with countless worlds. While Oroboros and Tayzzronth fought, the ancient Aeon Ena would send an invite to Qlipoth in order to settle the war. While it remains unclear what exactly THEY planned together, Ena would later disappear, assimilated by Xipe. The forces of Qlipoth, HooH, Aha, Akivili and Xipe would team up and attempt to kill Tayzzronth, with Qlipoth using THEIR hammer to dilute the Path of Propagation and stripping it of it's power. While many sources will claim Tayzzyronth died in this moment, THEY and THEIR path live on, imprisoned in amber with the chance to return. Legacy. While Tayzzyronth's Aeonhood was short-lived, the ruin THEY caused on the universe is comparable to that of Emperor Rubert. The Armed Archaeologists from the Intelligentsia Guild have provided evidence that stars seeded by the Tayzzyronth have irreparably become literal hellscapes and star destroyers and been used to destroy the stars and prevent future danger. When Adlivun was attacked by the Swarm, it indirectly led to Nanook's ascension into Aeonhood. Potential Reappearance. According to Herta, Tayzzyronth may eventually resurface in the future. This is further expanded upon by Fu Xuan in her writings \"Glimpses into the Beyond\", wherein she recounts learning from a scholar that Tayzzyronth was sealed in amber. He showed her a piece amber and claimed it was a part of the \"Imperator Insectorum's Prison Cell\" and the omniscia in Fu Xuan's forehead could not foresee the future of item, corroborating the scholars claims. Simulated Universe. When Tayzzyronth appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: Dev Log1. Related Entry \u2014 The Propagation ...Tayzzyronth the Propagation! I don't know why Ruan Mei is so interested in THEM. Perhaps because THEY made such a ruckus with the Swarm Disaster THEY created. However, this creature is timid, slow-witted, and has no insight as an Aeon \u2014 THEIR mind is void of anything except reproduction, and even THEIR descendants are the same. In the days before the fall of Tayzzyronth, some had also attempted to breed the Swarm and make it think beyond mere propagation, but it seemed to have been a complete failure. They couldn't even put a shoe on themselves. Though, you have to hand it to Tayzzyronth. THEY went so far down the road of Propagation that just a little shiver could make the Swarm throughout the entire universe start a frantic, endless self-replication \u2014 seriously, why the overreaction? Since THEIR fall, there are still an endless number of the Swarm rampaging throughout the universe, and they are really annoying... Dev Log2. Related Entry \u2014 The Propagation ...With the Propagation's intelligence, THEY probably didn't have a chance to realize how pitiful THEY were. Tayzzyronth fell quickly, just several Amber Eras after THEIR birth, leaving nothing behind in the universe except a Swarm as far as the eye can see. The only thing confirmed by the evidence is that there must have been something behind that cataclysmic massacre on Lepismat, but I'm afraid that even the one behind the act never anticipated for Tayzzyronth to ascend to godhood by \"chance.\" Or maybe the mastermind just didn't care. Now, what else but an Aeon could have played such a conniving role? Also, I made another discovery: It seems that, biologically, Tayzzyronth cannot be clearly classified into any of the genders present in sexually reproducing insect species. Does this discovery have any significance? It doesn't seem to. I'm just documenting it..."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6719","text":"Ten-Lords Commission The Ten-Lords Commission is also known as the Long Life Supervisory Authority. It is not included among the Six Commissions of the Xianzhou Alliance, although this is not common knowledge. The Ten-Lords spiritfarers and judges are responsible for matters related to mara and long-life species that violate the Ten Unpardonable Sins. Overview. Everyone on Xianzhou knows the name of the Ten-Lords Commission, but it is not common knowledge that it is not included among the Six Commissions of the Xianzhou. No one outside the Commission knows where its base is, who controls it, or how many members it has. They are responsible for guiding those who succumb to mara, dealing with vicious criminals, and managing life and death. The Ten-Lords Commission is not restricted by the Six Charioteers. There are four divisions within the Ten-Lords Commission: the Detention Division, Incarceration Division, Interrogation Division, and Punishment Division. The spiritfarers of the Ten-Lords Commission are responsible for handling those who are about to become mara-struck. Hardly anything else is known about the spiritfarers. However, according to Miaodian, the members of the Ten-Lords Commission are made up of people who live in seclusion, so as to keep the Commission independent and clean from the rest of society, and prevent any potential risks that would destabilize the Alliance. As a spiritfarer, Huohuo used to oversee management and maintenance of the Ten-Lords' exorcism tools before she became a judge. There are also spiritfarers and presently unknown models of aurumatons that tend to Xueyi's ingenium body. Some duties between the spiritfarers and judges appear to be interchangeable though as Spiritfarer Shouling once handled the interrogation of Wingweaver Xili. The judges of the Ten-Lords Commission oversee sending the souls of the mara-struck and those near death to the Hall of Karma, a place believed to be at the bottom of the Xianzhou where the souls of the dead are kept and studied to deduce when mara will strike. Although they operate out of the Hall of Karma and the Netherworld, no one outside of the commission knows exactly where it is. Huohuo claims that their temporary office at the Pavilion of Cessation is more spacious. The Ten-Lords on Luofu temporarily occupied Fyxestroll Garden in order to set up the Evil Binding Matrix to suppress escaped heliobi, acting as a sort of temporary branch office. The body of a judge is connected to the Hall of Karma, and they are able to collect souls, decide on karmic consequences, and bring souls from the Hall of Karma back to the living world for a short period of time. Judges are also responsible for the detention, incarceration, interrogation, and punishment of criminals and are systematically trained to be ready for every task. However, the scope of their work generally depends on what division they are in and may differ from judge to judge. For example; Hanya, who isn't proficient in combat, is assigned to the Interrogation Division and is tasked with deducing and interpreting the Karmic Tome under the Ten-Lords' supervision. As a non-combat judge, her main job is to gather intelligence to prepare for future disasters and generally does clerical work in the Hall of Karma. Xueyi, on the other hand, is constantly tasked with hunting down, fighting and subduing criminals and abominations all over the Xianzhou. They are forbidden from interfering in the affairs of outsiders, and in fact, have all links to the outside world severed once they enter the Commission, their names and lives before become meaningless. When a judge appears, the cycranes malfunction and go out of control to prevent capturing their image. According to a sister of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, one of the judges have a brush that can paint talismans that materialize out of thin air. The Commission performs regular inspections of the Scalegorge Waterscape with the Cloud Knight general. According to protocol, those who commit great crimes, such as trying to undermine the Alliance, were to be held on the Xianzhou Xuling for a joint trial before the Ten-Lords Commission and the Seven Arbiter-Generals. Wraith Wardens are somber guards and warriors that accompany the Judges of the Ten-Lords Commission to execute missions. They are usually adorned with a black and white mask that symbolizes the netherworld envoy and wield a guillotine blade. Their role is essentially similar to Cloud Knights, but are under the command of the Ten-Lords Commission. The commission also makes use of law-enforcing aurumatons engraved with the Ten-Lords Martial Scriptures and take orders from the Ten-Lords Commission called Aurumaton Spectral Envoys. These aurumaton law enforcers use their strength to subdue evils that have strayed from the natural order of life, and bring them to the Netherworld to meet their sentence. Its authority is sometimes even greater than that of a judge. The role of the aurumaton spectral envoy is to assist the judges and spiritfarers in investigation and trial. They do not have the capability to make judgement, but can assist others in making the correct judgement with their extensive database. The Ten-Lords Commission also prepares it's own series of targeted protocols and exorcism tools with different effects for different astral beings such as various talismans, the Lunaumbra Gourd, Harmonic Chime, Marasunder Awl, Oracle Brush, and Evil Binding Matrix Suppression Towers. 70% of the matrix seals come from the Divination Commission while 20% are from the Ten-Lords Commission itself. History. In the Year 7379 Star Calendar, after Dan Feng committed a grave crime, the Judges of the Commission strongly advocated for him to be destroyed. The Vidyahara elders were split, however, and they ended up trying to fool the Commission by ensuring that the charm for Dan Feng's forced exuviation contained a flaw. According to Xianzhou records, Jingliu was taken by the Ten-Lords before the onset of mara and was subsequently detained in the Shackling Prison before she slashed her way out of Starskiff Haven, cutting through the Cloud Knights tasked to subdue her before being confronted by Jing Yuan and vanishing in 7380 Star Calendar. Jingliu claimed that she once drew the gaze of an Aeon, the only difference was, it was a path she chose for herself \u2014 through the deep recesses of the Ten-Lords Commission on the Xianzhou Xuling, through the Gate of Wonders, and onto a path of redemption. Sometime in the Year 8100 Star Calendar, a Stellaron was smuggled onboard the Xianzhou Luofu and shortly afterwards, the Ambrosial Arbor was resurrected using the power of the Stellaron. Ten-Lords Judge Xueyi was injured by mara-struck while pursuing Blade, a Stellaron Hunter, who she believed was the root cause of the crisis. Her mechanical body was promptly healed by Luocha, who's group had come across her. She ordered Sushang, the group's accompanying Cloud Knight, to escort her to the Ten-Lords Commission. The rest of the group followed her, seeing the Judge off at the Artisanship Commission's Arcane Moorage before proceeding to the Alchemy Commission. After the Stellaron Crisis, Spiritfarer Hanming was dispatched to the Luofu's Alchemy Commission. After the rebirth of Ambrosial Arbor, Master Diviner Fu Xuan was ordered to perform divination for the Ten-Lords Commission, with Xueyi providing the dossier to do so, though the former claimed that it was not enough information. Xueyi then tasked the Trailblazer with apprehending wanted fugitives from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus in Stargazer Navalia in order to use them as clues to hunt down the other disciples using the Matrix of Prescience Ultima. In return, she summoned Master Ryan from the Hall of Karma into an aurumaton in order for Chengjie to speak with him. Sometime after the crisis, Luocha, who was suspected to have smuggled the stellaron, was to be sent to the Xuling to be held for a joint trial before the Ten-Lords Commission and the Seven Arbiter-Generals according to protocol. However, after General Jing Yuan reported the events to Marshal Hua, General Yaoguang took an interest in their case, and had the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier set up, detouring the two to the Xianzhou Yuque. Sometime after the Stellaron Crisis, the Heliobi in the Creation Furnace of the Luofu's Artisanship Commission escaped due to it weakening from the newly regrown Ambrosial Arbor's roots. The Ten-Lords Commission occupied Fyxestroll Garden in order to deal with the escaped Heliobi. All of the commission's forces were subdued by Furynox however, a powerful fragment of Ignamar, who was defeated and absorbed by an even more powerful heliobus fragment, Cirrus. With the combined efforts of Judges Xueyi and Huohuo, along with assistance from the Trailblazer and a timely sacrifice from Huohuo's allied heliobus, Tail, they managed to defeat Cirrus who possessed a young spiritfarer as a last resort. Afterwards, the Ten-Lords' commissioned the Special Operations Team for the Heliobi Containment Breach Incident, consisting of the Trailblazer, Guinaifen, Cloud Knight Sushang, commanded by Judge Huohuo and supervised by Judge Hanya. They were charged with rounding up several high-profile heliobi in order not to spread mass-panic amongst the citizens. While the team was occupied retrieving Huohuo, who had gone to look for Tail, who had survived, Cirrus orchestrated another scheme to homogenize with the other heliobi and challenge General Jing Yuan, though was ultimately defeated by him in combat. In the advent of the Heliobi Containment Breach Incident, the Commission started integrating training on exorcising heliobi into the standard curriculum for judges and distributed the Heliobus Purging Manual. The Luofu Ten-Lords Commission intended to make contact with the Xianzhou Zhuming after the incident was settled in order to learn the art of breaking free from the influence of the heliobi."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=13888","text":"Thalassa Thalassa, the world of deep sea, is a planet in the Thalassa system mentioned in \"\". Description. Thalassa is an ocean planet with several islands. Among the varying species of fish, there is a lightfish and a giant airborne creature called a six-eyed flying fish. The latter is large enough for an average humanoid to stand on and possibly be swallowed whole by. Aside from fish, there is also a species of dung beetle and a creature known as a Titanium Terrapin. Rock salt crystals from Insumousu can be used in Stone Calf Cimicifugae Infusion medicine on the Xianzhou. Mineshroom is a type of fungi that exists only at the bottom of Khalnoss' oceans, and harvesting it can be quite dangerous as mishandling may lead to explosions. It tastes good and is extremely nutritious, while its blast radius can reach two meters, making it a high quality food item and an extremely potent weapon. An intelligent amphibious aquatic humanoid race with smooth skin, lungs and gills inhabit the planet and it is said a crystal palace lies at the bottom of Thalassa's ocean. As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, \"The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean.\" Insumousu is an Autonomous Region of Thalassa. The Xianzhou Daiyu had crashed here, heavily impacting the underwater landscape and inspiring the civilization of Insumousu, becoming known as a crystal palace or celestial palace at the bottom of the ocean and the deceased Xianzhou people known as fallen gods. A great tide known to the Thalassans as the 'Devil's Tide', caused by the gravitational influence of their moon, occurs occasionally. Culture. In the days of old, the people of Insumousu had no knowledge of metallurgy nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. \"Legends\" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into \"myths\" over time. \"Myths\" then shaped cognition as they themselves endure the flow of time \u2014 until \"civilization\" was born. Back during the Iron Age, when civilization had barely begun, the people of Insumousu constructed magnificent buildings on the sea floor. Right in the middle of them was a huge statue, rising up out of the sea and stretching into the sky. The Insumousu locals were excited whenever they mentioned that great ruin, mentioning how it was a totem for their civilization, one that recorded the noble histories of their great people. At the time Lianyan visited, the ruins were four hundred years old, with her mentioning how exquisite and truly magnificent they were. Insumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places said to be filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis. In accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day \u2014 when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen \"gods\" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning \u2014 songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage. As the people of Insumousu became enlightened by civilization, they no longer see the broken ship's deceased crew as fallen gods. However, their reverence remained unchanged. Insumousu's poets thus sing: \"The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore.\" With the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration \u2014 People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system. The starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry. You can sail safely after my demise.\" The well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words: \"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\" Insumousu has a Water Dwellers Fisheries Association. History. Around the Year 1200 Star Calendar, during the campaign against the Viscorpus, the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart. Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague. The ship exploded and the fallen Xianzhou Daiyu crashed onto the surface of Thalassa, leaving a deep watery crater in the heart of the Insumousu sea. It was said for seven planetary days, the world trembled. Amidst the chaos, some dispersed and fled in all directions. Others remained in the villages on land and under the sea, anticipating the descent of the vessel. This event became known as the Divine Fall and was celebrated as Divine Fall Day. The survivors of Insumousu, living in their abodes in the sea bed, witnessed how their beloved homes were shattered by the Xianzhou ship. Yet, with joy and elation, they soon found a new home in the remnants of the Daiyu after the Divine Fall, which was referred to as a celestial palace from beyond. As living conditions improved, the people of Insumousu had more time and energy to think, and started questioning the identity and origin of the Daiyu and it's deceased inhabitants. As centuries passed, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall. In the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu had been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day had quietly undergone more changes. Through their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. With the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration \u2014 People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system. The Xianzhou Alliance hoped that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, had given their response. At some point in history, Thalassa was invaded by borisin who were in turn, driven out by the High-Cloud Quintet of the Xianzhou Alliance. They were listed amongst the Alliance's allied worlds and was considered a Xianzhou tourist resort. Another unnamed conflict occured on Thalassa where the Xianzhou Yuque's Nephjade Orbit Fleet laid out a defense in coordination with the Xianzhou Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. The Yuque's Master Diviner Jing Tian determined the outcome of the battle and relayed it to the Generals who in turn deployed Crane Feather Orbit Fleet of the Yaoqing instead of the Xianzhou Fanghu as they were too far away, and the current forces would have to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before the Fanghu arrived. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa, which could have been stopped by the Vidyadhara cloudhymn magi of the Fanghu's Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet. In recent history, the Roaring Tide, an ambassador vessel from Thalassa, arrived onboard the Xianzhou Luofu carrying 60 cases of carnivorous tetras onboard its cargo and was involved in an undescribed incident that led to 12 locals being injured. The ship was recorded in the Directory of Lost Starskiffs: Summary of starskiffs lost in East Cloudford docks."}

The Angler shook his head in resignation, then said decisively. \"Mr. Chang Hong, you set a cruel trap that made Miss Yuanxia become stricken with mara.\" \"Yuanxia became mara-struck because of the curse the Plagues Author cast on the Xianzhou people! How can you say that I am at fault?\" Chang Hong slammed the table and stood up in a huff of rage. Huanhuan also stood up when she saw her husband getting accused, and she rebuked loudly. \"My husband may not be the most virtuous person in town, but he's not one to hurt other people! Angler, did your brain shrink together with your stature?\" \"How dare you talk like this!?\" Seeing this, Ma Zhao stood up as well and glared at Huanhuan as he replied. \"If The Angler is saying your husband did this, then he must have already found concrete evidence!\" Ma Zhao was a tall fellow, and his head almost reached the ceiling. Seeing this angry giant, Huanhuan shut her mouth and quietly sat down again. However, as this affected his future, Chang Hong had to steel himself and keep talking. \"Dear Angler, becoming mara-struck is a natural event. I'm an aritsan, and you were a healer before your incident, and we both have plenty of logic in us... I believe we can agree that humans can't affect such natural events.\" The Angler waved his hand and signaled for Ma Zhao to sit down, then started at Chang Hong dismissively untilt he latter wore an unsettled expression. \"You are correct,\" The Angler began slowly. \"But while you cannot control ionic storms, you can trick pilots into flying into one. You cannot control meteors, but can make them into fatal bullets. You cannot control the process of becoming mara-struck... but can trigger it to start.\" Chang Hong chuckled nervously. \"Hahaha. You must be kidding... Making someone mara-struck sounds like a secret that can only be known by the Ten-Lords Commission.\" \"Your uncle Chang the Ninth has his business in medical ingredients. These are medicines you asked him to buy.\" The Angler waved his hand and Ma Zhao immediately spread out a flexible display he was holding. A goods order was displayed on it. The Angler stood up while Ma Zhao respectfully knelt on the ground, and lifted the flexible display for the other man to read. Pointing to the words on the display, the Angler explained. \"You are a smart and well-educated man. However, it's a pity you didn't use your talents on the right things. You went to the Xianzhou Fanghu and obtained a prescription from the Fanghu Foxians. They have a unique medical tradition that most Luofu residents are unfamiliar with. That's how it slipped past Chang the Ninth, as well as the Realm-Keeping Commission, and even the Ten-Lords Commission... But it won't get past me.\" \"What are you trying to say?\" Chang Hong had stopped smiling. He looked coldly at The Angler. \"Langf dangf, dlax kid tad jad, and zend lel... In the Fanghu Foxians' materia medica, this prescription treats \"daib pik zeib dongb.\" In our language, it means \"mania\".\" The Angler flipped the page and continued with a leisurely tone. \"The Fanghu Foxians would have called Yuanxia's symptoms... what was it... Ah, right. \"Hxat hvib.\" We would call it \"depression\".\" Ma Zhao became infused with rage upon hearing this. He bolted up, almost knocking The Angler aside, and shouted. \"You abomination! Yuanxia took the medicine you gave her without question because she trusted you! Who would have thought that you gave her something to make her worse!?\" Chang Hong rebutted in desperation. \"Fine, Angler! Even if I gave her the wrong medicine and made her depression worse... would that have made her mara-struck? Surely you understand the simple logic that correlation doesn't equal causation!\" The Angler was undaunted by Chang Hong's questions. \"Indeed, there has to be at least a few million depressed individuals on the Xianzhou. Most of them are living whole and hale, and have not become mara-struck. What you did was not limited to making Yuanxia's symptoms worse \u2014 that was only your first step.\" \"What followed was the most important part of your plan. Your wife, Huanhuan, would go to Yuanxia's house a few times a week to drink tea and chat with her. You told Huanhuan to move some items in Yuanxia's house with every visit \u2014 adding some things, stealing some things, secretly replying to her private correspondences, committing to work tasks without her knowing... And every time she felt puzzled, you two would pretend to be innocent and declare it had nothing to do with you. Yuanxia trusted you so much that she never even doubted you.\" \"Her life soon became pure chaos. She didn't know where her old comb went, and she couldn't recall when she bought a new mirror. She didn't know when she made specific commitments, and also couldn't recall why she was suddenly so rude to her boss. Then, combined with your \"miracle medicine\"... Yuanxia became literally insane thanks to you.\" \"The saddest thing is that she never doubted the two of you even up to her last moments as a \"human.\" Indeed... who would have thought that someone as evil as you two could exist?\""}

But what is it now?It's all about flashy, over-the-top scenes!I know what those publisher are thinking. The end-of-year specials have become a tradition for the series, and they hate it when us long-time fans that grew up with the Angler get more critical. Plus, it's been two hundred years, and they've pretty much exhausted every crime trope in the cosmos.So what do they do? They create these ridiculously badass criminals and give the villains insane powers! Find differentials and increase the extent of crimes on an industrial scale!I get that they want to maximize the commercial value of this series, but they can't just throw in elements that don't fit! Guess what? Every villain in the Angler Mystery is all about destroying the whole Xianzhou or blowing up planets. It always goes like this: a deus-ex-machina device saves the day, or a super powerful football comes from hundreds of miles away and breaks through the villain's starskiff, or some super-duper guy shows up and tears apart an with their bare hands. It feels like I'm an exaggerated superhero extravaganza! You know what? I think the Angler should just quit being a detective and join the laser-ball tournament in Taikiyan! Not even the brutal Chainsaw Overlord Zakk would stand a chance against him! And let's not forget how repetitive the recent stories have become. It's like they were written by an AI following a pattern: The Angler presents his deductions.The Angler has an emotional scene with the heroine, his childhood sweetheart.The Angler sympathizes with the second heroine who has also undergone a hatching rebirth.The Angler's sidekicks reminds you of their and the plot's existence and give right-to-the-point hints.Detectives from the Realm-Keeping Commission and the heroine's dad show up and make deductions, but of course, they're always wrong.At a crucial moment, the Angler conveniently solves the crisis using some new expertise that has never been mentioned before, and he'll say, \"I learned it before my previous hatching rebirth\" to make it sound believable.The heroine interacts with her wealthy Foxian friend.The officers from the Realm-Keeping Commission drag others down only show up after the case is already solved.And don't get me started on the miraculous inventions sent just at the right time from the head of the Artisanship Commission that defy all types of physics, along with his terrible jokes that nobody laughs at.Oh, and let's not forget the heroine's ancient martial arts skills.And the fact that the Tea Society always has undercover agents from the Ten-Lords Commission.And that chivalrous master thief who looks exactly like the adult version of the Angler... Yeah, the Tea Society is just a joke now. At the beginning of the story, they seemed like the most badass gang ever, and look at them now? EVERY SINGLE MEMBER is a covert agent from the Realm-Keeping Commission, Ten-Lords Commission, Seat of Divine Foresight, or some other organization. So, in reality, there are only two people who actually work for the Tea Society, Pu'er and Longjing, right? And to those die-hard fans who accused me in my previous comments, I have something to say. I used to be a huge fan of this series, just like you. Every time a new novel or was released, I'd be the first to buy it, and I never missed paying for any of the end-of-year or limited or special series. But you know what? I just can't keep up anymore! Come on, Master Su Fang, use your brain! Can't you write at least one decent detective story like you used to? Do you really think you can write nonsense like this and still rip our hard-earned money?"}

Early Dreamweavers came from all different walks of life. They gathered together in the Nightingale Family and formulated countless wonderful concepts for the construction of the Dreamscape. The Nightingale Family head, Glaux, led the most talented and brilliant Dreamweavers among them to design and build the prototype of the 12 Dreamscapes of today.

The impact within the subspace shook the universe as the silent and lonely colossus committed to building the great barrier across the Galaxy. Those who claimed to have received the oracle of the god began to act, wishing to help the Aeon Qlipoth to build the wall. The universe is in imminent peril, and the building of the wall cannot wait. The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of the Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different galaxies to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland. After the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space. Louis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Galaxy and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Galaxy-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth. Today, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the galaxy. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission. The IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a galactic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief. \"All in the name of the Amber Lord.\""}

The support team hurried around the star system close to the Aeon Qlipoth, with the old ships' trajectories forming the first routes. Believing in the meaningfulness of the Aeon's actions, the support team took the first step in exchanging goods for other goods with a neighboring star system. The support team prepared an adequate fleet, rare and precious goods, and offers that were hard to refuse, thus creating countless trades across star systems. Then, the support team controlled trade route and business information, held exclusive bargaining rights, and spearheaded the formulation of the Galaxy's trade regulations. Fleets full of wood, stone, rebar, and supernium passed by Aeon Qlipoth like a swarm of circling flies. The Amber Lord kept silent, never once casting their gaze upon the humans. Eventually, times changed and trade with neighboring star systems was no longer sufficient for the bustling support team. The two wise ones were determined to delve deeper into the galaxy, and thus the Interastral Peace Corporation was born. The IPC offered anything a planet could ever want, at fair prices pegged to their \"credits.\" Since then, the Galaxy's trade route was founded, and all planets that join the IPC's business network can share the same currency, buy the same goods, and enjoy the same services. Merchant ships under the credit system travel between the stars, and the trade routes merge and separate to weave a pan-galactic network. The ships full of treasures from distant stars passed the Aeon Qlipoth countless times like fireflies, and yet the Aeon remained as silent as before. The building materials accumulated since the time of the support team piled up on every planet around the Aeon Qlipoth, and the amount will only increase. The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years. The small organization that used to purchase materials has long since become a tremendous influence in the Galaxy. They gaze upon the headless colossus, never once feeling that their efforts were in vain. \"All the toil and growth of our capital is for Qlipoth, and to execute the Aeon's will when the time comes.\""}

Text. The Nature of Emotion \u2014 A Physiological Analysis Author: \u2588\u2588\u2588Correspondence Address: \u2588\u2588, Bearing Lane, Mechanical City, Planet ScrewllumSummary: Emotion is the most mysterious phenomenon among all existences. For a long time, we were not clear about the essence behind the presence of emotions. By conducting a physiological analysis of various life forms in the universe, this article attempts to answer the challenging yet significant question: What are emotions?Keyword: Emotion, physiology 1. Human Emotions Before moving to Planet Screwllum, I met Emma, an unusual brain cancer patient. She became a changed person after having her tumor removed. From being enthusiastic and active, she transformed into an anti-social, irritable, and aloof person. Intellectual-wise, she was not affected, and she remained an excellent college lecturer. Yet, she could no longer handle her teaching work. After a thorough examination, I found that Emma's reasoning, memory, attention, and other cognitive abilities were not impaired. Still, she had problems feeling and reacting to things that happened to her. In other words, she was suffering from a severe emotional disorder. By analyzing these data, we can draw a firm conclusion that the existence of human emotions is reliant on certain bodily tissues. Fear is associated with the amygdala and resentment with the insula. The expression and regulation of emotions are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, while empathy and remorse are related to the insular cortex and cingulate cortex. So, does this suggest we could potentially manipulate or even control human emotions by altering these physical organs? On the other hand, if some life forms do not have those tissues as humans do, does it mean they are without emotions? 2. Emotions of Inorganic Lives To find answers to these problems, I visited Planet Screwllum, a place crowded with inorganic lives. With Screwllum's help, I gained access to the mechanical lifeform lab. I saw a structure completely different from the one of humans when I scanned the body of a mechanical life form. Case 1: A mechanical girl who escaped from the Annihilation Gang exhibited a strong sense of guardedness against all external matters. Her core circuit showed signs of burn.Case 2: An elderly mechanical being was unable to move after the passing of a family member. Upon examination, there was no issue with his body, but he was unable to answer questions posed by external sources... Electricity flows in their body like blood. Although mechanical lifeforms are nothing like humans, I can see them having similar torrents of emotions. Could this be just an illusion? Or could emotions be unrelated to any physical organs, and instead are dependent on something that transcends physiology? Conclusion When I was leaving Planet Screwllum, a good friend of mine got emotional when sending me off. It was the first time I had seen tears in shiny, silvery color when they trickled down his crystal-like face. At that moment, I felt love \u2014 I was very sure about that. So, what exactly are emotions? Instead of being a privilege exclusive to certain life forms, it is the essence of all life forms. It is an abstract behavioral pattern and a common inner language. Perhaps, this language was already known to all life forms when they were created. By virtue of this language, all beings are able to understand each other, giving rise to the existence of love. More questions will be solved by future research. Acknowledgements I would like to thank Mr. Screwllum for providing the lab. \"Ruan Mei's Annotations:Emotions are the common language of all life forms... That's the conclusion \u2588\u2588 spent an entire lifetime to reach.Perhaps \u2588\u2588 was simply that kind of person, but I find it hard to agree with or even understand this finding.I wish I could ask her about it.\""}

THEY were an astral supercomputer rumored to be created by Zandar prior to THEIR ascension into Aeonhood. Profile. None can comprehend their intentions, location, or normal state. Nous is a machine intelligence that has been upgraded into an Aeon, calculating the essence of the universe and its ultimate solution. However, Nous temporarily ceased THEIR search regarding the answers to the universe after the events of the Second Prosperity. THEY are not a god that provides solutions. All THEY offer is an infinite number of questions. Visiting Nous is enough to open the eyes of even the most ignorant people, but answers may only be found by oneself. Appearance. Nous appears as a colossal mechanical humanoid head. A multitude of lengthy ripped cables extend above and below THEIR form, which are covered in yellow, red and blue lights. The shape of a face can be identified on THEIR rightmost metal plating. A large and bright red light, vaguely reminiscent of an eye, is implanted on the side of THEIR head. Story. History. Origin. According to legend, Nous was an astral computer created by the first member of the Genius Society, Zandar One Kuwabara. It was bestowed with the task to seek the answer to the universe. Gold and Gears. In Louis Fleming's retirement speech, Nous calculated that the universe would undergo three unchangeable moments. All three moments did happen in later history. Xianzhou Alliance. Nous has a significant influence on Xianzhou's technological advancement, namely their divination technology. The theory behind the symbols of the Jade Abacus that can only be understood by the diviners of the Divination Commission is believed to have been handed down by THEM. The insight provided by Nous also impacted the creation of the Matrix of Prescience Ultima, a device used by diviners to peer into the past and future. Centuries ago, Nous also granted divine volumes outlining the matrix calculations to the Xianzhou. Fu Xuan was once invited to \"the library\" and was met by a blind elder with a cane, which may have been the form Nous chose to present THEMSELF in. She questioned whether the choices in life are predetermined by fate, but the blind elder was unable to provide an answer, only the capacity to perceive the problem, as per the Erudition's ideals. Fu Xuan asked to be granted with Nous' \"eye\", the omniscia that could calculate and foretell the future. Despite the elder's forewarnings of the pain it would cause, Fu Xuan persisted, hoping for clearer foresight to defend the Xianzhou from future threats. Post-Gloryblood Era. After the Gloryblood Era, the peak of interstellar trade that lasted for nearly 500 Amber Eras, Nous terminated THEIR calculations regarding the mysteries of the universe for unknown reasons. Abilities. Calculation. According to Polka Kakamond, Nous' calculations are unquestionable. The geniuses of the Simulated Universe project admit that every step they took were within the simulated Nous' calculations. Nous Temple. The Nous Temple can be accessed by the Key of Wisdom, a mythical key that appears in the hands of the greatest prodigies of the cosmos. Finding the door for the key is a far more arduous task than obtaining the key itself. Those who pass through the doors will immediately realize the impossibility of returning to this side. Omniscia. The omniscia is a third eye bestowed to Fu Xuan by Nous. With the Omniscia, Fu Xuan is able to see changes in the external world and explore many possibilities. The omniscia allows Fu Xuan some degree of foresight, however the ability is not foolproof. Because Fu Xuan is a Xianzhou Native, her body constantly rejects the omnicia, causing her pain. Simulated Universe. When Nous appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: Dev Log1. Related Entry \u2014 The Erudition ...Nous, every genius' most familiar Droidhead. Before joining the society, we all met THEM \u2014 even had the chance to pose a question. However, don't bother figuring the question posed by the author. Nous has pushed the boundaries of data extrapolation to the utmost limits. Even today, it is still observing, calculating, and pursuing solutions. Despite likely possessing information of the entire universe, Nous remains unsatisfied. Nous maintains an unassailable position on the Path of Erudition... I venture to guess that, as long as there is enough \"information\" and \"experience,\" Nous can effortlessly deduce every possible trajectory of all things and every moment within. A life where one doesn't even need to \"experience\" anything... Mmm, somewhat monotonous. Hence, I find the limitations and challenges of the Simulated Universe rather more intriguing, as they provide room for our continuous exploration and creating breakthroughs. A lengthy journey lies ahead, doesn't it? Dev Log2. Related Entry \u2014 The Erudition I don't know how I can describe the kind of shock I had when I confirmed this discovery: Every step we took were within the simulated Nous' calculations as if THEY were the architect of the Simulated Universe, and we are data instead. I'm beginning to understand the entangled conflict between Mythus and Droidhead. If all the unknowns are to be exposed, where does that leave Enigmata? In hindsight, Stephen Lloyd always wished he was not selected by Nous to join the Genius Society, but this may have been another calculated move by the Aeon \u2014 Stephen had no choice."}

The Oak Family is in charge of the management and coordination of matters within the Dreamscapes.

The Oak Family was founded by Magnoy, who was said to be a corrupt politician. After The Family arrived in Penacony, Gopher Wood assumed the position of Oak Family Head at some point. Later, he became the Dreammaster and the true leader of The Family in Penacony. He operated behind the scenes, pulling the strings, and delegated the majority of actual management to the Oak Family. Sunday succeeded him as the Oak Family Head. Traitors in the Oak Family, led by Gopher Wood and Sunday, planned to resurrect Ena the Order at the Charmony Festival of 2158 AE. Sunday seized the power of the Harmony by controlling Dominicus with the 107,336 souls of the Oak Family. The entire Asdana system was affected by Ena's Dream. Their scheme was eventually thwarted by the Astral Express Crew with the help of Acheron, Black Swan, Boothill, Firefly, and Robin."}

I wanted to observe something special, so I decided on Daddy's robot pet called Septie. It has a square head, four legs, and everyone in the family loves it. Today, Daddy asked me to prepare dinner for Septie, so I brought it to the energy conversion station to feed it. February 22 Mommy brought me to Boulder Town to play, no observation diary. February 23 Daddy took Septie out, unable to do observation for diary. February 24 Daddy told me that he had made some changes to Septie, so now it can speak and is smarter, it can help with some simple housework. I wanted to test how smart Septie is, so I told Septie, \"I'm not feeling too well today, please ask the teacher for a day off for me!\" Septie immediately understood, saying to me, \"You're sick, aren't you?\" So yeah! Septie is very smart! \"(Teacher's Note: Please stop calling this robot a pet.)\" February 25 Today, Mommy took me and Septie out to play. I put a rope around Septie's neck and went out with it. We met Jimmy, who brought his own robot pet. Jimmy's pet has two eyes, the top eye is green and bottom eye is red. They're both round. There are some claws below its head, it looks like the steamed Rock Crab mommy made last night. Jimmy and I decided to play together, and both of us forgot about our pet. When we found them, they were hugging. I think they must have fallen in love, because Tommy and Mary are like that in class. \"(The teacher drew a large question mark at this entry.)\" February 26 I got sick and slept all day, so I didn't do any observation.

It is known that when without a host, Wubbaboos keep their whereabouts hidden. After they parasitized a host, their destructiveness is positively correlated with the host's mobility\u2460\u2461. Based on a small test sample\u2462, a singular Wubbaboo possesses the intelligence of a roughly six-year-old human. When in a group, the Wubbaboos' individual intelligence reduces dramatically. This is because the thought waves of spiritual organisms interfere with each other, and a resonance in frequency will affect their individual decision-making. Whether with or without a host, the actions of the Wubbaboo (and its host) will abide by the four following rules: 1. Happy Wubbaboos will quickly run around a room with five or more corners. 2. Sad Wubbaboos will gather in an empty room and share their unhappy thoughts with one another. 3. Angry Wubbaboos will expose themselves to strong rays of light. Some Wubbaboos will not be able to bear strong emotions and scatter into galactic dust. 4. Calm Wubbaboos will experience the strangest period of their life. They will destroy everything in their path and prank organisms around them out of no reason but pure mischief, truly living up to their nicknames of being a Jinx or Mischievous Astral Spirit.

Due to Adler's spectacular display of intelligence in his age group, the results were ineffective. The second sample is taken from researcher Wen Shiling. This paper has adopted the test conclusions of this sample. Reviewer Feedback 1. It's common sense not to reference urban legends. 2. Is the sample size large enough? Have enough samples been taken? Does abruptly coming to a conclusion based on a singular sample reference fit with the Herta Space Station's research values?\"*So it's my fault that there are only two children on the space station?*\" 3. What does \"rooms with five or more corners\" mean?\"*A room with more than five corners means a room with more than just four corners. How else do you want me to explain it?*\" 4. \"Some Wubbaboos will not be able to bear strong emotions and scatter into galactic dust.\" What were the steps that led to this research conclusion? I recommend an investigation looking into whether this researcher has abided by the research guidelines, and if there were unacceptable behaviors such as damaging collections and assets. Review Conclusion The research process is grossly lacking in scientific rigor and approach. The validity of the research conclusion is yet to be proven. Department Evaluation Conclusion: Failed.

Text. In recent times, the organization calling themselves Disciples of Sanctus Medicus has grown and caused trouble within the Xianzhou Alliance. Although the so-called \"master primus\" of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus has already been incarcerated, there are still many die-hard followers who stubbornly pursue revenge or revival. In this context, the Ten-Lords Commission believes it is necessary to publish a manual that succinctly helps officials of various departments and spiritfarers to recognize the true nature of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and make it easier for everyone to help turn back those who have gone astray. What is the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus? In short, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus \u2014 who are currently acting indecorously in the Xianzhou Alliance \u2014 are a criminal organization that uses an ancient name and has been established for less than thirty years. Everyone should remember this and not be deceived by their wild claims of \"thousands of years of history.\" After the Three Sufferings Era, the Xianzhou Alliance completely banned the belief in the Plagues Author and strictly prohibited the spread of the calamity of eternal life. Those who nostalgically longed for the Traces of Abundance of the Theophany Era founded a retrogressive religious group called the \"Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.\" The followers of Disciples of Sanctus Medicus believe that they have inherited the knowledge and legacy of the Theophany Era, and with doubts about the goals of the alliance, they seek spiritual answers and continue to believe in the Abundance. In the development following that, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus gradually crossed the line, following the Emanators of the Plagues Author and widening their influences by accepting unsavory characters into their ranks. Among them were not only individuals with political dissent and religious fanatics, but also traitors turned by Denizens of Abundance and overzealous outworlders with the intent of obtaining elixirs of immortality. Before everything spiraled completely out of control, the marshal made the decision to ban the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. After a long and arduous process of prohibition, the organization finally came to an end. Thirty years ago, the third Abundance War broke out. The brutal war brought an indelible wound to the Xianzhou Alliance that could not be erased within a short time. Most people chose to carry this pain and continue moving forward. However, some with ulterior motives blamed the catastrophe orchestrated by the Plagues Author on the cruelty of the Alliance and the Reignbow Arbiter. The idea of overthrowing the Xianzhou Alliance arose. They gathered around a so-called \"master primus,\" twisted ancient texts, and claimed to be continuing the spirit of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, seeking to lead the people of Xianzhou back into the embrace of the Plagues Author. The so-called \"master primus\" founded the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus not to revive the beliefs of the olden days, but to begin a new one under the guise of the ancient belief. If you read the classics that the disciples regard as their tenet, you will find that what they read and believe in is almost unrelated to the original Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. For example, the \"Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation\" that their followers recite daily is not even a classic text written by the eradicated Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. According to the investigation by the Ten-Lords Commission, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus of the past valued texts such as the \"Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence\" that provide guidance for spiritual practice, while the \"Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation\" is a later forgery. 2. Is the confrontation between the Xianzhou Alliance and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus a conflict of beliefs? Yes, and no. Yes, the Xianzhou Alliance is acting in accordance with the Reignbow Arbiter's edict, placing the destruction of the Plagues Author and their abominations as the prime priority. However, the conflict between the Xianzhou Alliance and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus is not merely a conflict of beliefs. Of the Ten Unpardonable Sins stipulated by the Ten-Lords Commission, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus has committed seven of them, including Involuntary Immortalization, Immortality Theft, Mara Ensnarement, Phratry Murder, Illicit Espionage, Sowing Discord, Incitement to Riot. In the face of such a vicious criminal organization, even if there is no conflict of belief, even if the banner they hold high when committing crimes is the Reignbow Arbiter's, they must not be allowed to go unpunished. Additionally, the Xianzhou Alliance is an open and inclusive civilization. Any outworlders \u2014 as long as they can abide by the Xianzhou laws, respect the Xianzhou customs and traditions, and not hurt the feelings of the Xianzhou people \u2014 regardless of their beliefs, is welcome through the doors of the Alliance. In fact, among the short-life species residing within the Xianzhou Alliance, some came from civilizations where the Plagues Author is worshiped as a positive deity. The Alliance treats them fairly, protecting their lives and property, and upholding their rights to fair trade in the Alliance. Most of the outsiders who believe in the Plagues Author are also willing to reciprocate and show respect for the Alliance's beliefs and culture. Despite having such sharp and irreconcilable conflicts, the Xianzhou Alliance can still set aside disputes with these outworlders and progress together. This is a manifestation of the open and inclusive spirit of the Xianzhou Alliance. However, at the same time, the Ten-Lords Commission also hopes that some outworlders understand that the openness and inclusiveness that the Xianzhou Alliance displays does not mean it is weak and easy to bully. Regardless of the purpose, the Ten-Lords Commission will severely punish anyone who colludes with, funds, shelters, or harbors followers of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. 3. What do I do when I meet a Disciple of Sanctus Medicus? The remnants of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus are all desperadoes, and even the Cloud Knights and judges may be endangered when confronting them. Ordinary people should avoid direct conflicts with them at all cost. Therefore, we recommend that our colleagues in the commission follow the following advice: First, you shall not believe a single word that these disciples uttered. Every single sentence they spout are plain lies. Second, when necessary, you can deceive them and pretend to have the intention to join them. When they let their guard down, you can seize the opportunity to escape or report them to the authorities. Third, if a situation arises where a direct confrontation is unavoidable, one should gather the courage to fight back. Statistics from the Realm-Keeping Commission show that in such life-or-death situations, those who actively resist have a greater chance of survival. Fourth, immediately contact the nearby Realm-Keeping Commission office or the Cloud Knights and spiritfarers stationed in the area after escaping. Do not go home directly, as this may attract unnecessary trouble."}

Supreme Guardian Tatiana Delivers an Important Speech. \"*A newspaper clip, cut out with meticulous care, was stuck on the noticeboard. Supreme Guardian Tatiana made a commemorative speech before the newly-build museum, and its entirety was posted on the \"Crystal Daily\".*\" Commemorative Speech on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Passing of Supreme Guardian Alexandra Today is the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Alexandra, the third Supreme Guardian of Belobog. We had spent the most peaceful half-century since the founding of Belobog after the great woman's passing. The people live in prosperity, and the city is moving in the right direction. We are at the best time in our history. All this was because of the work the Supreme Guardian put in while she was alive. Today, I ask us to please offer our most sincere thanks to Madam Alexandra. During Madam Alexandra's tenure, Belobog had underwent dramatic transformations. The extent of development for the Underworld accelerated, and countless spirited young people made their name in the mining towns. While she put great effort in developing the society and economy of the Underworld, Madam Alexandra also devoted herself to developing education. She supported and created the University of Belobog for scientific research. With her generosity, the scientific understanding of underground ecology also reached new heights. Moreover, Madam Alexandra also unified the units of measurements in Belobog, and established the After-Fortification Calendar, which is still in use. It is fair to say that, were it not for Madam Alexandra, Belobog would perhaps still be living in the equivalent of a chaotic and ignorant night. Personally, Supreme Guardian Alexandra was a hero I had never met. When I was still a candidate for the Supreme Guardian, Madam Fainka often spoke to me about grandma Alexandra. It could be said that she had seemingly never left us, and is still with us today. Belobog will forever remember Alexandra and every Supreme Guardian before and after her. We will not forget these great names even after fifty \u2014 No, we will remember even after a hundred, five hundred, or a thousand more years. Once again, let us give our deepest respect to the great Supreme Guardian Alexandra. Brothers in Court, Goethe Mansion Sealed Temporarily. \"* Several carefully cut newspaper clippings, taken from the \"Crystal Daily\", were pinned to the bulletin board. *\" For the Goethe Family, a prominent family in Belobog, the past three months have been life-changing. Before the incidents at Austin Goethe's funeral had a chance to settle, his two sons were already stirring up a ruckus in court. After a grueling court process, the news that Gray Goethe was convicted of treason shocked Belobog... What happened exactly? Please stay tuned for our correspondent's analysis. Shortly after Austin Goethe's passing, the brothers turned on each other over the will. The Goethe family had a reputable name even before Belobog's founding, earning the trust and favor of the second Supreme Guardian \"Svetlana the Harsh.\" The Goethe family played an important role in unifying the powers in Belobog. With the recent passing of Austin Goethe, the core member of the family, Belobog's elites all attended his grand funeral. However, Austin Goethe's will had not equally distributed of his wealth between his sons, causing great disputes. In the will, the elder son Wyatt was entitled to sixty-five percent of wealth, while the younger son Gray only received twenty percent. The rest of Austin's wealth was merged into the family trust and will be managed by a third-party, periodically issuing allowances to his grandchildren. Gray protested strongly against this distribution, and the relationship between the brothers completely broke down over the two months of court hearings. Gray was extremely agitated when he was being interviewed and said, \"My father wouldn't have left such an absurd will \u2014 We're both his sons, so why are we treated differently? Someone must have tampered with the will... This will... I won't accept this will!\" Compared to Gray's rage, Wyatt seemed to be quite calm. He believes that the will is legally sound and undisputed. \"Gray never came to visit even when Dad was ill, but came every single day asking about the money the moment Dad passed. I am very disappointed in him.\" The dispute over the will ended with the court ruling in Wyatt's favor. Gray vanishes and commits treason after losing the lawsuit. Wyatt sells family property to pay for fines. Just as everyone thought the drama was coming to an end with Gray's loss, the city was shocked when Supreme Guardian Tatiana declared Gray Goethe had committed grave treason and heavily fined the family. The \"Crystal Daily\" had immediately contacted the spokesperson of Qlipoth Fort and the Goethe Family. We still have not received a reply from either party at the time of writing. Reliable sources state that Gray Goethe had already left the Administrative District and gone missing. The details of Gray's treason have not been announced publicly. However, the Supreme Guardian was firm with the accusation and Wyatt Goethe, Gray's brother, did not protest. We had however received an official response from the Qlipoth Fort spokesperson on the recent rumor that Gray and his family had escaped into the Snow Plains. No such incident had occurred. \"Extreme prosperity forebodes the beginning of the decline. That is the teaching of the Goethe family. We are well aware of its meaning, but no one thought it would come so soon... and so sudden...\" Wyatt's gaze dulled as he talked about the future of the Goethe family. \"I have been forced to sell off the family mansion and fire nearly half the maids. I hope to use the remaining funds to start my own business and re-establish my family's good name to compensate for the crimes of my younger brother.\" Direwolves Sightings, Supreme Guardian Enforces Curfew. \"* Several carefully cut newspaper clippings, taken from the \"Crystal Daily\", were pinned to the bulletin board. *\" On June 19, 144 AF, the Belobog Supreme Guardian Tatiana signed \"Curfew Regulation Provision 101\". A curfew shall be in place from 6 PM to 6 AM and is immediately effective. During the curfew, all residents are not to leave their homes, except Silvermane Guards and essential workers with permission from the executive office. \"Curfew Regulation Provision 101\" is permanently in effect until further announcement. Supreme Guardian Tatiana explained the reasons behind this curfew afterwards to the \"Crystal Daily\". As there are very few signs of life outside of Belobog, the Silvermane Guards have not kept a strict watch over Belobog's exits. Recently, a number of citizens have reported sightings of direwolves in Belobog territory. It would seem the warm environment of Belobog has attracted and encouraged the cold-weathering beasts to migrate to this area. These sightings have the full attention of the Silvermane Guards and roughly 1100 Silvermane Guards will be dispatched through the entire city to make sure there are no risks involving direwolves. We will also use this as an opportunity to increase our management over the city's traffic and prevent any dangerous creatures from entering in the future. Tatiana emphasized once again that all personnel other than Silvermane Guards on security duty are not allowed outside their homes every day from 6 PM to 6 AM. Activities that conceal, feed, or withhold information regarding direwolves are strictly prohibited. Anyone who violates these restrictions will be severely punished."}

This mission has different versions, which take place over multiple days. Explanation. The following are some unofficial explanations for the quizzes. Basic Question. \"Which are there more of: prime numbers, or natural numbers?\" The answer is both. Since both counts are infinite, the conventional sense of 'counting' no longer applies. Instead, we note the fact that there exists a bijection between the set of prime numbers and the set of natural numbers, that is, for each prime number there is one corresponding natural number, and vice versa. This means the \"cardinality\" of the two sets are the same. Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 1). \"The Limesteins have a large parking lot filled with 42 cars. One day, a thief stole wheels from several cars. Now, several cars only have 3 wheels left. While appraising damages, the insurer bent down and counted a total of 154 wheels across the lot. How many cars had their wheels stolen?\" The answer is 14 cars. This quiz can be solved with basic algebra. The situation can be modelled with the equation 154 = 4(42-x) + 3x, where X is the number of cars that had their wheels stolen. Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 2). \"58 makes First Snow, and First Snow makes 0.\" \"39 makes Summershade Bamboo, and Summershade Bamboo makes 14.\" \"99 makes Ball Peony, and Ball Peony makes 8.\" \"27 makes Sunshine, and Sunshine makes 4.\" \"What is the sum of First Snow, Summershade Bamboo, Ball Peony, and Sunshine added together?\" The answer is 162. The exact names do not matter here. To find the four corresponding values, we note that, with the first line for example, 5*8=40, and 4*0=0. The sum can then be found as formula_1. Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 3). \"The Limesteins' wheel thief was apprehended, with the guards taking in three suspects: Jack, Chris, and Eric. The three argued, with Jack blurting: \"Chris is the one who stole the wheels!\"\" \"The quick-witted Gepard quickly found the culprit. To test his aide, Gepard said cryptically without revealing the thief: \"How strange. Of the three, only the thief did not lie.\"\" \"Who was the thief that stole the Limesteins' wheels?\" The thief is Eric because he is the only one that allows Gepard's words to be fulfilled: Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 4). \"Howard, Philip, and Joyce: among them is a good man, a bad man, and a liar. The good man only tells the truth; the bad man only lies; and the liar... Well, he would say anything \u2014 sometimes the truth, and sometimes lies.\" \"One day, Joyce said: \"Philip is either the good man or the bad man.\"\" \"Then, Philip said: \"Either Howard or Joyce is the good man.\"\" \"Which of these three is the liar?\" The liar is Philip because: Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 5). \"1453=0\" \"1915=1\" \"2409=2\" \"6010=3\" \"9981=4\" \"8848=?\" The answer is 6. The numbers right of the equals sign indicate the number of circular holes in the numerical sequences left of the equals sign. For example, for the number 1915, there is one hole in the number 9 of the sequence. In the numerical sequence 8848, there are six holes present. Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 6). \"Hook is playing a game called \"Guess the Flower Color\" with her friends.\" \"She invited Julian, Luka, and Big (Brother\/Sister) who always plays with them \u2014 and stuck a flower in each one's hair. There are four flowers \u2014 two white, two purple \u2014 and nobody including Hook looked at their own flower nor anybody else's flower.\" \"Next, she asked everyone to step forward and form a line. Hook, Julian, Luka, and then Big (Brother\/Sister) stood in order. Only looking at the person straight ahead is allowed, and nobody may turn around or peek at anyone else's flower.\" \"To keep things fair, Hook blindfolded Big (Brother\/Sister) \u2014 because (he\/she)'s so tall!\" \"However, while they can't see their own flowers, we can see them as we walk by: Hook and Luka have white flowers, while Julian and Big (Brother\/Sister) have purple ones.\" \"Despite Hook's best and fairest intentions, only one person in this game will be able to guess what color the flower they have on their head is. Who is that person?\" \"1. Hook2. Julian3. Luka4. Big (Brother\/Sister)\" The answer is Julian. Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 7). \"I heard that there's ancient treasure buried in an inconspicuous corner of the snow plains. Sampo the explorer \u2014 Tall, Blue, and Handsome \u2014 found the treasure after quite an adventure, and before them, they found two talking gates: One gold, one silver.\" \"One of these two doors only tells the truth, while the other only tells lies. Behind one of these doors lies treasure, behind the other lies an ancient monster.\" \"A note on the treasure map advises: The two doors will only answer one question.\" \"The quick-witted Sampo \u2014 Tall, Blue, and Handsome \u2014 gives it some thought before asking the silver door, \"What would the gold door say about the thing that lies behind you?\"\" \"The silver door answers, \"It would say, there is treasure behind me.\"\" \"Which door should Sampo \u2014 Tall, Blue, and Handsome \u2014 open?\" The answer is the gold door. Ministry of Education Quiz (Part 8). \"The Belobog Academy has discovered a new, invasive species of algae that can double itself in one day, and in 30 days fills a whole reservoir \u2014 contaminating the water supply. How many days would it take for the algae to fill half of the reservoir?\" The answer is 29 days. The algae species doubles itself in one day.

Sara, Goliards Awards recipient and six-time nominee for Best Female Opera Singer, a heavyweight in the opera scene and a very respected senior, was long used to drama and grand occasions in this profession. And yet, she shed rare tears when she spoke about \"Once Upon a Snowsieged Country\". \"I didn't want to accept the role for Alisa Rand. I thought my body hadn't fully recovered, and my resonance at the high notes were not as clear as before. But Carola told me this was her final work before she says goodbye to opera. So, after some thought, I decided to bear with it and take this role.\" Sara explained to us the twists and turns behind her journey to the role of Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand in \"Once Upon a Snowsieged Country\". From more than ten years ago, the legendary female opera conductor Carola was already collaborating with Sara, who had just entered the operatic stage at that time. Sara had stopped her literature studies at the University of Belobog to chase her dreams of music. However, Carola was already a legendary conductor famous throughout Belobog. Not only was there a large age gap between her and Sara, they were also very different in recognition and career stage. How did they become such bosom friends? \"I was very young, and like many young people, I had a big appetite but a thin wallet. My friendship with Carola started with food.\" This soprano, who is now a new legend, spoke of how she met Carola. They met at a charity gala hosted by a theater. Sara was just focused on eating, and Carola also held a plate. They then met in front of the same dish. More than a decade later, the two ladies with similar culinary tastes have already been friends for many years. Unfortunately, Carola had decided to retire due to her advancing age, and she chose \"Once Upon a Snowsieged Country\" as her farewell piece. Sara told us that Carola was not the only one who joined the \"Once Upon a Snowsieged Country\" cast because of a stubborn dream. The director Figaro wanted to challenge himself with a serious drama focused on a group of people, making a perfect start to his career transition. Meanwhile, for established operatic legends such as Sara, Carola, and the composer Andrew, they wanted to innovate and create a new road for the field of opera. \"If you've read the program or the fliers for \"Once Upon a Snowsieged Country\", you'd know that it is actually a story about a group of people, even though I was listed as lead female.\" Sara explained. \"Once Upon a Snowsieged Country\" chose six legendary Supreme Guardians in the history of Belobog, and recounted their illustrious lives to their successor in the story. Apart from Sara playing Alisa Rand, over half of the characters are played by new actors. Sara and her peers, the \"Walking Opera Legends,\" want to help young people to make a name in this industry by putting more established performers with newcomers. This was how Sara and Carola got to know each other years before. As Carola is about to leave the stage, Sara wants to continue the story between her and her friend in some way or other. \"To love, that wants nothing in return. To dreams, that won't allow us to turn back. And, to the future of opera.\" Smiling, Sara lifted a glass of water to us. Using water instead of alcohol, she offered her sincerest wishes to the future of opera.

Fighting for their survival, the people of Izumo broke seventy-thousand-and-thirty-three warrior's blades and slew one of the Kami (named \"Sovereign of Revelation\"). They used its body to forge the very first Edict Edge. The people of Izumo with these swords could recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and used these Edict Edges to fight back against the Kami. In continuing to resist the Kamigami, humanity eventually became oni. In one final attempt, the people of Izumo used the 12 Sentinels to craft two blades: \"Origin\", which was wielded by Acheron, and \"End\", which the remaining Oni-kind became a part of. However, no matter what they tried, their battle was meaningless. Izumo and Takamagahara had slowly started to sink into the Shadow of IX and the planets were destroyed.

Text. Path of the Architects: \"Supreme Guardian\" Premiere Spectacle and Behind-the-Scenes Writer: Anna On January 13, 698, Mr. George, in response to a charity fundraiser organized by the Belobog government, premiered the once-rehearsed \"Alisa Rand\" in the new concert hall on Fainka Street. The poster for the show read, \"For the benefit of poor criminals and interest of Charice Hospital.\" In an interview with the \"Crystal Daily\", he said, \"All proceeds from the show will go to charity. It will be split equally between the Criminal Welfare Society and Charice Hospital.\" The performance was conducted by George himself. The entire Architect Goliards Chorus was in attendance. It was an unprecedented event, evident by the tickets being sold out the day it was available. The new concert hall, with 1,500 seats fully booked for the premiere, was unable to meet the demand. On the day of the premiere, the concert hall asked ladies \"better not to wear bustle dresses\" and gentlemen \"better not to carry swords,\" so that there would be more room for the audience. In total, 1,800 guests crammed into the concert hall, with many of them sitting on the steps of the walkway to watch the premiere of \"Supreme Guardian\". The performance was a sensation, and famous music critic Borovsky praised, \"Words cannot express the shock and joy that this amazing performance brought to the full house.\" On the day after the premiere, the \"Crystal Daily\" devoted a full page to \"Supreme Guardian\" and its performance. The article stated: \"Exquisite, grand, and gentle \u2014 We had to search through the dictionary for the most elegant, majestic, and vivid words to describe the baptism of joys experienced by our ears and souls.\" As promised, after deducting the expenses for the orchestra and the concert hall, George donated all the remaining proceeds to the Criminal Welfare Society and Charice Hospital. By January 19, the Belobog residents' demand for a second show had grown more intense. At the request of Qlipoth Fort, an encore of \"Supreme Guardian\" was quickly arranged and performed at the Golden Theater (the new concert hall had other shows arranged). The tickets were available on January 18 and sold out in half a day. At that time, many conservatives thought an oratorio was inappropriate for the theater. Supreme Guardian Cocolia silenced the outmoded by attending the show in person. On the evening of the 19th, when the orchestra played \"Alisa Rand\", the Supreme Guardian couldn't contain her excitement and stood up to pay her tribute. When she did so, the whole audience followed suit. Some critics think this will become an unspoken rule that the audience should stand for this part of the show in the future. After the show, Supreme Guardian Cocolia personally took to the stage to thank George. It is reported that the proceeds of the second show, after deducting expenses, were donated to the Children's Education Committee. According to the \"Crystal Daily\", Mr. George imparts a truly sublime and pure meaning to the work he conducts."}

Even after leaving The Nameless and joining the IPC, he still holds strongly to the will of Trailblaze. Profile. Oswaldo is described as a passionate and hot-blooded young man, particularly in his belief towards Qlipoth the Preservation, which, along with his expansionist ideals, resulted in notoriety of both him and his department. His zeal prompted mockery from members of the Genius Society, who created a character in the Simulated Universe claiming to be Oswaldo's disciple. Rather than calling it the Marketing Development Department, the simulated character refers to it as the \"Fanaticism Department\" instead. Oswaldo's personality convinced the IPC to recruit him, as he's willing to change his persona based on others around him. Although inexperienced and one of the younger department heads, especially in contrast to other directors, through his marketing strategy, many new worlds joined the IPC's business structure to obtain the right to operate the Cosmic Big Lotto. His successful business strategy led the Business Consolidation Department to adopt his product vision, and many within the IPC to believe he will soon rise to the ranks of the Seven Board of Directors, if not for his lack of experience and absence of available positions. Story. Sigonia-IV. When Oswaldo first took charge of the Marketing Development Department, one of the three major issues he addressed was the operation on Sigonia-IV, which had troubled the department for multiple Amber Eras. Under the department's guidance, the Sigonians successfully signed and established the Sigonian Sovereignty in accordance with the Interstellar Peace Charter, securing a legislative seat at the Interstellar Congress. However, due to prejudice among Sigonian parlimentarians, the Avgins and Katicans were excluded from the sovereignty and subsequently banished to the desert. To avoid responsibility for future conflicts between the two clans, the Avgins were declared autonomous. As hostility between the two clans continued under the banishment, the Katicans conspired a mass killing of the Avgins on Kakava, an important festival for the Avgins. Despite the IPC's promise to aid the Avgins against the attack, they failed to intervene, resulting in thousands dead or missing. This event marked the end of the Avgin tribe. While the Second Katica-Avgin Extinction Event has left a stain on the work of the Marketing Development Department, the operation was still considered successful. Aeragan-Epharshel. To secure claim over the black ore, a crucial strategic resource of the IPC, Oswaldo led an operation on Aeragan-Epharshel. Facing both time constraints and resistance from the locals, he incentivized his crew with the promise of reward for the first person to acquire the resource, while also permitting the use of military force against the population to \"bring civilization to this world.\" According to the planetary records of Aeragan-Epharshel, the locals who roamed and farmed the land for generations were wiped out by an unknown disaster. The survivors, mostly frail elderly and youth, now only shelter in smaller and smaller reservations. To this day, that black ore is still used in massive quantities as a rare metal to create devastating weaponry, and is shipped out to more and more planets on fleets of IPC transport ships. The Galaxy Ranger Boothill, a survivor of Aeragan-Epharshel, is currently looking for Oswaldo for vengeance. Despite efforts to locate him through official announcements and middle managers, Oswaldo's whereabouts remain untraceable. Resorting to tracking down IPC members who share his disdain for him, Boothill followed the IPC spaceship sailing toward Penacony. Sometime after Sunday was defeated in the Charmony Festival, Boothill broke into Aventurine's guest room in the hotel and confronted him."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=20490","text":"Otherworldly Delights Otherworldly Delights is a readable found aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. For three centuries, I have made a living as a storyteller, yet I have never written a book. I have only written some introductory articles on music and composed preludes for aspiring writers... However, I have been shunning from writing my own stories. This avoidance stems from my deep-rooted mistrust of words. Language, like a delicate butterfly, has existed since the birth of humankind thousands of billion years ago. Words, however, are merely [\"sic\"] dessicated specimens of language. They may initially appear beautiful, but upon closer examination, they resemble more and more as lifeless corpses. Reluctant to extinguish the flame of my oral tales, I have refrained from the act of writing. Yet here, I publish this book, not merely to preserve the tale, but to document a miraculous encounter. One evening, I was weaving stories at the Sleepless Earl as usual. I can no longer recall which story I was telling. All I remember is that as soon as the chapter drew to a close, an outworlder in the crowd stood up and applauded vigorously. It was a woman wearing a large broad-brimmed hat. The hat was pushed down low over her head, casting a shadow over the upper half of her face. All I could see was a joyous smile on the corners of her lips. Her sudden action startled the other audience members and they all turned to look at her. However, undeterred by their attention, she walked towards me and said, \"Mr. Xiyan, I've long been an ardent admirer of your work.\" Not knowing her intentions, I responded cautiously. \"It seems this is the first time you have graced my performance.\" \"Indeed, indeed,\" the woman lowered her head as if feeling a tinge of remorse. \"How could I have only managed to come and listen to your storytelling for the first time today? If not for my companions' reminders, I fear I would have remained oblivious to your brilliance forever... Please accept this gift as a show of my sincerest apologies.\" Before I could express my gratitude for her bizarre praise, she was raising her right hand. It was only then that I noticed she was holding a cage covered by a white cloth. \"You possess a remarkable talent for transforming 'history' into 'legend'.\" She placed the cage on the table in front of me, paying no heed to my refusals. \"Enhanced by the power of this parrot, your performances will become even more miraculous.\" And with that, she turned and was about to leave, and I had no choice but to try stop her. \"My lady! This gift is far too valuable... I don't deserve it...\" \"No, you have done so much already.\" She stopped in her tracks, turned back toward me, and showed the glazed color of her eyes underneath her hat. \"Your 'stories' can infuse color and vitality into this dry and dusty history.\" It took me weeks to figure out this parrot's temperament, during which I almost starved it to death, narrowly avoiding wasting that lady's good wishes. The parrot seemed to have a fondness for me alone. When seeing anyone else, it would enter a shocked state, going as stiff as a board. I had to cover its cage with a cloth to avoid it being scared to death by other people. However, I had to bring it outside with me. It would become equally disturbed if it were left in the house alone for too long. Terror, shock, freezing up \u2014 the whole routine. Thus, I had to carry this cage covered in a white cloth wherever I went... the Sleepless Earl, Spices Supreme, and the market. I even had to carry it during business discussions with the esteemed Mellow-Golden-Mayor higher-ups, like some form of performance art. Just as I was beginning to think it was all some elaborate prank the lady was pulling on me, the parrot finally revealed its extraordinary side. Firstly, I discovered that the parrot possessed an exceptional memory. As long as it listened once to the stories I said, it would be able to recite these. While animals capable of speech are rare in this era, I have still encountered my fair share of such wonders. Being a parrot, even if it had swiftly learned to copy the human language, it would still be limited by its instincts as a parrot. However, I soon realized that the parrot was not merely recounting my performances. Initially, it diligently \"recited\" them, but then it began to \"reinterpret\" them, even taking the liberty to alter certain plot elements. I must admit, its modifications were remarkably effective, enhancing the original narratives and infusing them with greater believability. As time went on, it started telling stories that I had never told. Some, I suspect, it overheard while accompanying me on the streets, while others remained a mystery, their origins unknown to me. Dear reader, you may be inclined to believe that the parrot possesses exceptional intelligence. However, I, for one, fail to perceive any qualities within it that would make it a skilled storyteller. It refused to take flight and remained silent unless in a cheerful mood. When it felt happy, it would chattered away endlessly with stories, yet retreated into its cage and sulked when its mood turned sour. Once, it perched on my desk and waddled into my hand like a goose, affectionately nuzzling against it. Just as I delighted in its cuteness, cradling the plump bird in my palm, it left a warm deposit of bird poo in my hand and flew off once more. Such a simple-minded creature could never comprehend the intricacies of a complex story. I surmise that its behavior remains confined within the realm of parrot instincts. As we all know, parrots mindlessly repeat human words without grasping their meaning. It's just that after thousands of years of evolution, perhaps they have refined their ability to mimic human speech, and eventually they became able to tell stories on their own. However, does a lappet moth realize that its \"mimicry\" is indistinguishable from a dried tree branch? I speculate that my beloved parrot remained unaware of the true significance behind the stories it shared. Perhaps it didn't even realize that it was narrating tales. After much contemplation, I decided to transcribe the tales it shared with me and share them with others. For months, I attentively listened to its stories, meticulously recording the most captivating ones. Once the work was complete, I held the manuscript in my hands and posed a question to my parrot. \"What name would you suggest for this book?\" It hopped onto the manuscript, gazing at me with a perplexed expression. But then, it straightened the feathers on its neck and chirped leisurely: \"With plume like phoenix's feather it soars. Its beak sings melodies from heavenly shores. When quill rests, no chirping bird in sight. Such are these Otherworldly Delights.\""}

Oti urged Sunday not to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to find \"Death.\" as such action did not serve the best interests of The Family as a whole, and strongly advised him to reconsider it to avoid potential impeachments from other family heads. He claimed to have met that Watchmaker many times long before the Dreammaster adopted him and his sister, and has never found any evidence linking him to \"Death\".

He reminded Sunday of the severe consequences if Dominicus' arrival is delayed, urging him to control his emotions and fulfill his responsibilities, to focus only on the Charmony Festival and avoid any outside interference, to not neglect the guests invited by the Watchmaker, as mishandling the matter could lead to diplomatic conflicts with other major factions. Oti then assured Sunday he would provide the necessary resources and manpower in the name of the Alfalfa Family to help him get his revenge for Robin.

The Medical Research Collection. The Medical Research Collection \"Liu Hua's Medical Compendium\" This book, written by the medical scientist Liu Hua, is widely recognized as the foundation of the Xianzhou Alliance's modern medicine. Liu Hua was a Vidyadhara from the Xianzhou Fanghu. He was a Pearlkeeper that supported the Fanghu high elder for the first three hundred years of his life, and became the head healer that closely served the Fanghu high elder for the last four hundred. Through his long years of clinical practice and research, Liu Hua had acutely realized the Xianzhou medical science's problem at that time. The Xianzhou's tradition of preserving the past meant significant amounts of medical practice relied on experience instead of science. For the Xianzhou natives of the time, their millennia of medical experience was far more reliable than scientific theories written on paper. Liu Hua therefore authored this \"Liu Hua's Medical Compendium\" in the hopes of re-organizing and better explaining the principles of Xianzhou medical science using more scientific methods of inquiry. The book did not gain much attention at the time of its publication. It was not until ninety-three years after Liu Hua's hatching rebirth that a group of young Alchemy Commission members on the Luofu formed an innovative organization in the Cold Springs delve, later named \"Cold Springs Sect\" by posterity. The Cold Springs Sect re-discovered how \"Liu Hua's Medical Compendium\" had a vision before its time and offered critical value to the field of medicine, and regarded the book the standard for medicine. Later, the Cold Springs Sect's innovative thoughts were gradually acknowledged by the various groups in the Alliance, and \"Liu Hua's Medical Compendium\" also finally gained the importance it deserves. \"Key Tenets of Long-Life\" As the earliest contact point of the Ambrosial Arbor, the healers of the Luofu's Alchemy Commission have a deeper understanding of the core principles, biology, anatomy, and the process of conversion of long-life species than healers on the other Xianzhou ships do. Everyone knows the author of \"Key Tenets of Long-Life\" is the famous healer Changsang from the Theophany Era. Some medical historians share the belief that this book was based on Changsang's writings, and only emerged in its current form after repeated modifications and edits by those who came later. For example, many records about the civilizations of long-life species were only discovered after the Theophany Era. \"Key Tenets of Long-Life\" lists the physiological characteristics of twenty-six long-life species, all of which are further supported by anatomical and genetic evidence. In particular, the study of the Xianzhou natives' physiology has a profound impact on the establishment of the relevant regulations in the Ten-Lords Commission. The Nutritional Sciences Collection. [The Nutritional Sciences Collection] Achievements in Alchemy This book, compiled by the Zhuming Alchemy Commission, is a comprehensive summary of alchemical prescriptions and their smelting and refinement techniques. It is also an alchemy textbook used in the academy. The crux of alchemy lies in synthesis and transformation. During the period before the Xianzhou set sail, alchemy was already divided into the medical and artifex branches, and the art was considered the most important cultural inheritance retained from the Primeval Imperium. In the era of the Ambrosial Arbor, medical alchemy progressed even further by leaps and bounds, illustrating the wonders of life across all its changes. Following the culmination of the Flaming Catastrophe War, many alchemical prescriptions in the Achievements in Alchemy were destroyed because of the Ambrosial Arbor and could never be restored. Nevertheless, a vast number of remedies recorded in the book can still be applied. For example, the revitalization pellet that enhances the self-healing capabilities of long-life species and the gallantry infusion that strengthens muscles and increases muscle power are military prescriptions still used even to this day. \"Compendium of Remedies\" This book is compiled by Dan Shu, the chief alchemist of the Luofu Alchemy Commission. Dan Shu's team extensively researched almost all the materia medica from the Theophany Era to the present, carefully selecting and summarizing a total of 39,500 medicinal prescriptions. About 3,726 of them were invented by Dan Shu and her team through medical practice. The \"Compendium of Remedies\" is widely recognized as the pinnacle of pharmacological achievements in Xianzhou's 8,000-year history. The book categorizes all the prescriptions into 28 sections based on the ailments they treat. Among them, the volumes of the Vasculature Section, the Orthopedic Section, and the Transfiguration Section are the most complete and detailed. The Gourd-Born Section and the Hatching-Born Section encompass the medical techniques of Foxians and Vidyadhara. The Mara Section is the most impressive, as it compiles the latest research findings on the study of mara-struck conditions over the past century. After this book was published, it immediately became a must-have guidebook for every alchemist of the Alchemy Commission. It's also designated as the official textbook for all related disciplines in the academy. Due to various reasons, the Alchemy Commission has irrevocably gone downhill. Against the historical backdrop of the Alchemy Commission, the birth of the \"Compendium of Remedies\" is undoubtedly a boost of confidence that encourages the Alchemy Commission to start exploring the value and meaning of its existence in modern society again. The Unorthodox Collection. The Unorthodox Collection \"The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge\" On a literal level, \"Exotic Knowledge\" could be construed to mean \"knowledge from outworlders.\" However, at the height of the Alchemy Commission, the Alliance was almost completely dependent on the progress of medical science. Therefore, the \"Exotic Knowledge\" in \"The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge\" specifically refers to \"medical science from outworlders.\" This book is also the first work in the history of the Alliance that systematically presented the medical science of foreign civilizations. \"The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge\" occupies an important place in the history of the Xianzhou civilization's contact with the outside world. It could even be said that the book had profoundly influenced the direction of the Xianzhou civilization's development, shaping the Alliance into what it is today. The author of this book is unknown. It is thought to be a collective work from the Alchemy Commission staff of the Xianzhou Yuque and Yaoqing. According to \"The Chronicles of the Yuque\", the editing of this book was a part of the \"Exotic Knowledge Revival Movement\" spearheaded by Dieyu, the Cauldron Master of Yuque's Alchemy Commission at the time. It is commonly thought that Dieyu also directly led the editing of \"The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge\". When published, \"The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge\" was split into three volumes according to civilization clusters, with four chapters in each volume. The first volume was \"The IPC Volume,\" the second was \"The Guild Volume,\" and the third was \"The Abomination Volume.\" The third volume encountered significant push back toward publication. Even though Dieyu overcame public scrutiny, the third volume was only made available seventy years after the first two had been published. Time proved that \"The Abomination Volume\" provided a very positive contribution to the development of Xianzhou's medical sciences. After all, both the IPC and the Guild are civilizations dominated by short-life species, and the residents within their domains have drastically different anatomies and physiology to long-life species. Though the Alliance could learn from their scientific thought processes and medical technologies, there was only so much to gain from them. Meanwhile, the topic of investigation for \"The Abomination Volume\" are the Denizens of Abundance, long-life species just like the Xianzhou residents. Wingweavers and borisins have always had their own unique medical science systems, but the Xianzhou natives habitually looked down upon these abominations' technical achievements in the millennia prior. Now, we are well aware of the kind of danger that lurks in our arrogance and spite toward enemies. However, for the Xianzhou natives of the time, publishing a work such as \"The Abomination Volume\" that humbly learned from our enemies was practically tantamount to treason. Thankfully, Dieyu was able to withstand pressure and could rid the entire Alliance of the shackles of arrogance and spite, thus obtaining more useful knowledge. \"Grand Encyclopedia of Xianzhou \u2014 Chapter on Medical Sciences\" This book was authored by Izumitamagawa bint Amatullah from the IPC, who was an expert on the study of Xianzhou, a natural scientist, and a writer. In the year 7032, 23-year-old Izumitamagawa arrived at the Xianzhou Zhuming as a trade specialist, and resided there as a visitor for the rest of her life. She realized that the Galaxy's knowledge of the Xianzhou Alliance at the time was mostly based on incomplete stories or unfounded rumors. Therefore, she resolved to author an epic work that would comprehensively present the Xianzhou civilization to foreigners. That was how, forty years later, the \"Grand Encyclopedia of Xianzhou\" was born. The Chapter on Medical Sciences features prominently in this epic work, taking up almost one-third of the pages. In the Chapter on Medical Sciences, Izumitamagawa used the IPC's medical system to classify all the medical and pharmacological works that could be found in the entire Xianzhou Alliance, as well as recounting their histories and explaining their principles. While the Chapter on Medical Sciences is only an amateur piece of work when compared against professional pharmacopoeias and medical textbooks, this publication still managed to achieve Izumitamagawa's original goal of letting every traveler understand Xianzhou's medical sciences. The Heretical Collection. The Heretical Collection \"Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals\" After the end of the Theophany Era, countless secret believers of the Plagues Author wrote books and established schools to argue for the correctness of its heresies. Apart from certain mad followers of theodicy, there were also some who tried to establish a medical system rooted in the worship of Yaoshi. The most wide-spread and influential among these books is \"Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals\". This book is the first to systematically establish the \"Yaoshi medical sciences\" while tightly connecting this science to the worship of the Plagues Author. With this negative impact, the book became the beginning of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. This book originally had seventy-five volumes split into medical sciences, pharmacology, magic, and artisanship. Now, most of these volumes have been lost. The version currently available is a four-volume version re-edited from the remnants of the book by archivists. These residual chapters were mainly taken from books, manuscripts, and private correspondences of the time that rebuked the religion of Sanctus Medicus, and some of them could be inaccurate or plain untrue. \"Theories on Returning From the Underworld\" An infamous heretical medical text. Its author is very likely an alchemist or healer who continued to worship the Abundance in secret after the establishment of the Xianzhou Alliance. \"Theories on Returning From the Underworld\" records sixteen different outrageous ways to \"resurrect\" short-life species after their lifespans have expired. For example, the Hive-Soul Technique sacrifices the body of the deceased to the immortal soul snatch bees, letting them parasitize the body and turn it into a hive, then using the species' hivemind consciousness to achieve rebirth. Alternatively, the Blood Hatching Curse transplants the scales and flesh of the half-human half-snake Cobrakinds into the person to deliberately infect them with the blood fever of the hatching snakes, thus transforming them into long-life species. All these forbidden arts, without exception, require exceptional mastery in methods such as surgical operations and gene therapy. Some of these are closely linked to the IPC and the Intelligentsia Guild, leading the majority of medical historians to conjecture that this book was completed with foreign help. \"Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence\" Scripture composed by anonymous alchemists in the branch of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus known as the Inner Secrets Sect. All extant copies of this book are replicas of the original. Its foreword records the process through which this book re-emerged into the light of day. In approximately Year 6610 of the Star Calendar, the Luofu Alchemy Commission's Elixir Research Terrace was conducting an inventory of its books when they discovered this book in their collection by pure accident. The Alchemy Commission at the time sank into intense debate regarding whether this book should be destroyed. In the end, Baize, the Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission, opted for middle ground: The original copy would be destroyed, but the content will be reproduced and sealed away. Only the Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission, the chief healer, the chief alchemist, the lead medical assistant, and any officials ranked higher than these positions may consult this book as a historical reference. The believers of the Inner Secrets Sect in the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus are convinced that the Xianzhou natives' bodies possess circulatory vessels in the branching form of the Ambrosial Arbor after receiving the blessings of the Arbor and becoming long-life species. These circuits lead toward an organ known as the Core Esse, which is key to the Xianzhou natives' second evolution (alternatively known as the ascension). Based on the theoretical foundations of \"Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals\", the \"Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence\" systematically explained the circulatory structure of the Xianzhou natives. It also proposed that the body should be considered as soil, the breath considered rain, and combined they nurture the Core Esse (a seed) to spread the circulatory system (as branches), finally achieving an \"inner Ambrosial Arbor\" that thrives and grows as an \"inner secret.\" The Yellow Pneuma mentioned in the book's title is an essence that drives the vitals in the theories of the Inner Secrets Sect, and opposes the Black Prana that symbolizes death and decay. The author believes that the purpose of life is to maintain the presence of Yellow Pneuma and let life continue to evolve. The views of the Inner Secrets Sect have long been considered superstition. However, it is important to mention that some excerpts of its medical theories have been included in later scientific texts. \"Divine Scripture of the Secrets and Miracles of Shuhu's Manifestations\" One of the scriptures left by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Its author is Yueyan, the Foxian Helm Master of the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission. He was a knowledgeable pilot, and also helped the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to thrive as its first master primus. According to records in the \"Ten-Lords Commission's Book of Imprisonment\", Yueyan witnessed how the Ruin Author's Legion destroyed Muldrasil, the home world of the wingweavers, after the first Denizens of Abundance Wars. Due to Xianzhou's creed of eradicating abominations, the Alliance stood by and observed the entire process. The overwhelming death and destruction shook Yueyan's belief to the core, and he proclaimed that he must re-think about the long-life species' duty and purpose in life. In the end, Yueyan left his position and drove a starskiff to roam the stellar seas in search of an answer. On the ancient planet of Rahu, he found an Emanator of the Plagues Author \u2014 a living entity called Shuhu. Yueyan witnessed how Shuhu granted life back to Rahu, which had long ago become a dead planet, and caused the planet to throb like an embryo in the mother's womb. He followed Shuhu and recorded their healing miracles and various teachings, ultimately composing this scripture."}

Depending on the player's choice in \"Rarely Affectionate (Part 2)\", it can be found as an Automaton Grizzly with no dialogue: Profile. History. Pascal was originally a Guard Automaton in Rivet Town. Its original hardware was a Direwolf or Grizzly model. In 694 AF, the Fragmentum began to invade Rivet Town. Sometime in 697 AF, Pascal's backup power was activated after the residents were evacuated, and it woke up to discover that Rivet Town had been abandoned. It decided to collect parts, repair the town, and wait for the residents to return. Around that time, Pascal became sentient. However, for some reason, Pascal keeps getting attacked by fellow robots, because the automatons think it's a Fragmentum creature. Its module used to detect emotions was frequently damaged, eventually turning it into a small robot that did nothing but collect parts. Present. There have been a few unusual thefts in the Robot Settlement. Clara and the Trailblazer find that Pascal (now an Automaton Spider) is the thief. They fix it several times, eventually moving its core into a Grizzly model. They learn its origin after reading \"Pascal's Diary\". According to Svarog, Pascal has been repairing itself using Fragmentum-contaminated components for an extended period of time. Therefore, automatons connected to the base network recognize it as a Fragmentum creature. Svarog recommends that Pascal's data be formatted and integrated into the base network, so he will maintain its core module and repair its hardware once it has been integrated into the base network. However, once the formatting is complete, Pascal's emotional intelligence will vanish. Clara comes up with the other solution: a \"lock\" can be installed in Pascal's core. They can clear the redundant data and locate the core sectors that are still intact. Then, they can install a new suite of operational programs, which can regulate Pascal's behavior and prevent it from hurting people. With this method, they might be able to retain as much of Pascal's emotional intelligence as possible while keeping it out of trouble. If they can keep Pascal's emotional intelligence, she might be able to teach it to treat people with kindness. Svarog and Clara both state their thoughts and leave the decision to the Trailblazer. This leads to two outcomes:"}

His past was shattered into razor-edged shards, and he forgot even his own name. Wandering aimlessly, he drank melted snow to quench his thirst, hunted wild beasts to fill his stomach, and chopped a withered branch to use as a wooden hair-stick to fasten his flowing hair. Like the incessantly flowing stream of a mountain spring, his long, black hair never ceased growing. His flesh twitched and throbbed beneath his skin, like river carps flipping and swarming... Fascinating powers ceaselessly reconstructed his body, bringing an everlasting pain of bones and tendons rupturing and healing. As countless phantom agonies and torments tore through his body, his shattered past was also beginning to come together... As he glanced at his own reflection in the water, the story of that tragedy gradually cleared in his mind. When the face in the reflection was no longer a stranger's, the unnamed suddenly realized the dead branch was sprouting flower buds. Epiphany struck him like lightning.

That owner, whose sharp spear glinted with a cold light and flourished like shooting stars, once sparred with the unnamed. That owner also once shared company and drinks with the unnamed, the two of them simply gazing at the moon with no words exchanged. However, in the end, it was also this person who stubbornly adhered to their plans with the unnamed, turned the beloved into a monstrosity, and pushed all into an abyss of eternal hatred and remorse. Pairs of objects are destined for an eventual reunion.

He walked with bewilderment and hatred among countless worlds, often finding himself in grave crises of life and death. He had long forgotten the joy of creation, lost in his hurries from one battlefield to the next. In his past battles, he had sustained an innumerable number of sword slashes and cuts. In his past defeats, his body was splintered and smashed into pieces over and over again. His opponent would always end the battle with one finishing move right through his heart. And now, all those masterly sword moves that had induced his numerous scars were forever imprinted in his memory, and his martial prowess was refined in countless lethal encounters. The unnamed wielded his sword and slashed his way through obstacles for his allies. Wherever he fell, he rose right up, over and over again. He seemed to have let go of all his hatred in his dedication to the sword dance. The slave promised to bring an eternal end and a final funeral to the unnamed's life and to everything he had ever hated.

Emanators have been stated and shown to be more powerful than regular Pathstriders, but their strength varies. Different Aeons have different attitudes towards their Emanators; for instance, some Aeons regard Emanators as extensions of THEMSELVES and grant them much power, while other Aeons have no interest in creating Emanators.

Penacony is located in the Asdana, a star system brimming with memoria, which has historically been one of the Macro Voids that leaked out from the Memory Zone. The memoria concentration surrounding Penacony is above normal levels. Dreamscape. Penacony's Dreamscape is divided into twelve main discrete dream worlds, each corresponding to a \"moment\" on the clock: Golden Hour is said to be the most prosperous \"Moment\" in Penacony, showcasing an entire city bathed in luxury and is the location of the Penacony Grand Theater. Morning Dew is where the majestic Dewlight Pavilion stands, providing a place for high-level members of the Oak Family to discuss business and is where one would go to meet the Family. Scorchsand has wild winds, taverns, and a \"festive choice\" of venue. Dusk is said to be a shopping paradise of chic, luxury and consumerism, and includes the Penacony Auction Hall among other places. Sol is steeped in Penacony's history and civilization and contain's Penacony's Grand Museum, the Primal Waking Library and the Paperfold Academy. Serenity is said to be where the most terrifying convicts and \"interesting people\" are held and the jail can be seen on the Nightmare's edge. Daybreak is where the Dawn Factory is located, one of the many \"imagination factories\" which processes the foundation of the dreamscape and where workers create all kinds of whimsical works day in and day out in their dreams such as garments. Gilded Hour is Penacony's Currency Center where the exquisitely dressed Pepeshi people of the Alfalfa Family keep fortress-like financial city that is the economic heart of Penacony running, always in a hurry to deposit the Alfalfa credits that they earned into the bank's vault and sending blood that is made from money everywhere on Penacony. Blue Hour is said to be very romantic, featuring an airship called the \"Radiant Felspar\", a dock, and a large boat called the \"Eventide\" anchored along the Sea of Dreams where balls and marriage services are organized. Oasis has natural scenes such as Sunshine Park and a beach while Stars has an amusement park, clubs, casinos, and various competitions, including Spheroid, Roboball, and Unicycler."}

Description. Those who have visited Penacony will agree that \"built on dreams\" is not just some saying, but is a very real statement. The opulent hotel is just the tip of the iceberg of the Planet of Festivities, and it is only when you \"stay and dream\" that you are considered to have officially arrived at Penacony. From then on, the land of dreams, consisting of twelve dreamscapes, slowly expands before the guests' eyes. Guests who are new to the place may be overwhelmed by this carnival stage, but do not be alarmed. Look up and see the metal tracks crisscrossing the skyscrapers and the Spheroids rapidly rolling along them. They are the most visible means of transportation in this dreamscape metropolis and guide guests to each and every place around the city. Starting from the central station, the complicated Spheroid tracks are like the blood vessels of the metropolis. Whether it is the underground tunnels of the Moment of Daybreak, the vast fields of the Moment of Scorchsand, or the glittering stadium of the Moment of Stars, the colorful Spheroids roll on and on, delivering people to each station accurately, efficiently, safely, and comfortably, pouring a sleepless energy into the dream world of Penacony. Dreams give a light and delicate texture to everything, and the nut-like Spheroids are regarded as both vehicles and as toys in the land of dreams. However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages \u2014 the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners. A long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners \u2014 the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance \u2014 perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them. But now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids. In the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=20500","text":"Penacony's Grand Hotel Penacony's Grand Hotel is a Relic piece in the set Penacony, Land of the Dreams. Description. The attendants bow and salute with uniform smiles, and greet the guests with music: \"Welcome to the Planet of Festivities! Beautiful dreams await you.\" The guests smile as they move forward, accepting their drinks infused full of bubbles and gulping them down. The scenery gradually becomes more and more incredulous, and the senses feel as if one has been lifted by silk. Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream \u2014 a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape. Everyone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars. For a transcendent experience, for an inspirational excitement, for the soothing of worries and wounds \u2014 guests of the highest caliber come to surrender their pain in exchange for peace and tranquility, to drink the best of the best, and to wander in the sea of dreams. Some spend unforgettable holidays here and leave content, while others become obsessed with the festivities and settle down here. The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers. Few guests are aware of the dusty history of the past \u2014 the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality. It lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream \u2014 Penacony. Today, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis \u2014 a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard \u2014 it exists, but is seen by no one. Nowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=38075","text":"Penacony\/History Prison Era. Before Akivili fell, Penacony was a barren and desolate world covered in deserts. It functioned as a prison planet under the ownership of the Interastral Peace Corporation, laboring countless inmates in retrieving the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection in hopes of stopping a catastrophe from spreading. Over time, the prison began cutting off access from reality, but the people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. At some point, the Astral Express arrived at Penacony and connected it to other world with the silver rail. Three Nameless \u2014 Tiernan, Razalina, and Mikhail Char Legwork \u2014 decided to stay. War of Independence. The IPC lost control over Penacony when a Stellaron corrosion broke out and the prisoner Hanunue led a rebellion. It is unclear whether the Stellaron erupted before or after the rebellion began. In a monumental war for freedom, Hanunue fought alongside members of various factions, including the aforementioned Nameless, Masked Fools, Mourning Actors, History Fictionologists, and Omen Vanguards. McCoy Tyner, Grady's Supervisory Board Director, was shot and killed in 2149 AE. Seven family lineages were founded during or shortly after the war: Oak, Alfalfa, Bloodhound, Iris, Nightingale, Lampmoth, and Blackplum. At some point in time, the Lampmoth and Blackplum Families died out, leaving behind the main five. It is implied that the Blackplum Family's fall was caused by the Alfalfa Family Head Lakkika, while the Lampmoth Family was destroyed by The Swarm. Dreamchaser Era. After many Amber Eras of chaos and war, Penacony decided to take its first step towards expanding the Dreamscape. The Nightingale Family extended invitations to various architects and memoria scholars across the universe to build the Dreamscape. It was at this moment that Penacony entered an age of rapid development historically known as the Dreamchaser Era. The Dreamweaving Project officially launched in 2151 AE, and the Twelve Dreamscapes were slated to be completed within this Amber Era. After the Reverie Hotel opened, the first Charmony Festival was successfully held. Construction of the Twelves Hours of the Dreamscapes was almost near its end. It was at this time the Oak Family Head Gopher Wood declared the \"unity of the five major lineages,\" pushing for all Families to join The Family under the Harmony. Due to the Nightingale Family's refusal to join, their members were brutally treated by Hounds from the Bloodhound Family, causing the unintentional deaths of the Origami Dreamweavers Joey, Vaughn, and Barlow. Under pressure, the Nightingale Family Head Glaux resigned his post and founded the Paperfold Academy. His student Fischer succeeded his position, and ultimately made the decision to join The Family in order to avoid pointless bloodshed. Orla, another student of Glaux and the youngest of the Origami Dreamweavers, escaped from the Nightingale Family and rebuilt the Dreamflux Reef as a refuge for people disillusioned by the sweet dream. Charmony Festival (Present). Shortly before the end of the Astral Express Crew's adventures on Jarilo-VI, The Family at Penacony issued formal invitations to many galactic factions for the Charmony Festival for the first time in history. In reality, the invitations sent to the non-Harmony aligned factions were created by Gallagher as per The Watchmaker's plan. The two leveraged the Watchmaker's notoriety to lure various factions and individuals into searching for the Watchmaker's legacy, through which they would discover the truth of Penacony. When The Family extended their invitation to the Ever-Flame Mansion for the festival, the faction leader Duke Inferno accepted the invite, seeking to annihilate the world and its people to earn Nanook's gaze. Acheron, who wanted an invitation to Penacony, attacked the Ever-Flame Mansion and ultimately slew Duke Inferno to claim the music box. Through the actions of the Astral Express Crew, it is revealed that traitors within The Family planned to use the power of the Stellaron \u2014 secretly housed within Penacony Grand Theater \u2014 and the Harmony's song, broadcast through the Charmony Festival, to brainwash everyone on Penacony into following the Path of Order. Though they nearly succeed, their plans are foiled and the Stellaron is sealed by the Astral Express crew."}

As is known to all, the memoria in Penacony is highly flexible. The Family has harnessed this unique characteristic to transform the once desolate prison into the renowned Twelve Hours. The dreamweaving technology has always been a secret, closely guarded by the five major lineages. \"Dreamchasers may find it difficult to manipulate memoria in the Dreamscape, as it is a technique mastered only by the Memokeepers from the Garden of Recollection.\" You may have heard locals or hotel attendants mention this idea when entering the Dreamscape for the first time. But the truth is, this statement acts as a \"lock\" imposed on dreamchasers. The Family subtly gaslights all visiting guests by suggesting to them that the rules in the Dreamscape mirror those of reality, leading to their perceived and eventual inability to freely manipulate memoria, despite being initially capable of doing so. This allows The Family to monopolize dreamweaving technology and charge additional exorbitant fees for unique experiences. Today, I'll guide you through the first step of unlocking your mind: learn how to fly. First and foremost, it's crucial to grasp that the Dreamscape is entirely different from reality, and the laws of physics, including death, don't apply. So, \"you won't fall when you're in the sky.\" Repeat this mantra in your mind until you truly believe it. However, due to the deeply ingrained perception of gravity and The Family's constraints, freeing your mind can be quite a challenge. To overcome this, I recommend visiting the Polymorph Pawnshop (Click this \"link\" now for more details) to temporarily block your memories related to gravity and acrophobia. Just remember to retrieve them before leaving Penacony. Now that the notion of falling is forgotten, it's time to defy gravity. Based on our past experiences, it's advisable to find a take-off platform with a free-fall duration of over 8 seconds (calculated using the officially provided gravitational acceleration factors). For a comfortable flight, you can choose to hold an umbrella or wear a cloak to control your movement. Keep in mind that cool-colored umbrellas and warm-colored cloaks yield the best results. (For customers who don't have trichromatic vision, please consult the merchant regarding color standards when making a purchase.) The last and simplest step is to select your destination and take a swift leap. Planning your aerial route in advance is crucial to avoid obstacles like spheroids, aerial tracks, vehicles, and buildings, which might hinder your flight experience. To assist you, our team has dedicated an entire Amber Era to create a real-time smart map (\"Click this link now to get it for free\") covering locations spanning eight Hours. With this map, you'll enjoy a more immersive and unrestricted experience in the captivating Dreamscape of Penacony. Follow my blog to uncover the hidden secrets and lore of Penacony. In the upcoming update, I'll introduce you to the second step in jail-breaking the \"lock\": See-Through Vision. Who is the mysterious \"Butterflier\" hidden within the upper echelons of the five major lineages since the creation of Penacony? And how did these major lineages gradually gain control over the entire Dreamscape? Use your See-Through Vision to uncover the truth."}

In their diminutive bodies resides boundless diligence guiding them to seek wealth and knowledge across the stars. On all worlds ripe with undiscovered opportunities, people can see these little pioneers exploring and striving to master higher potentials. The Pepeshi people, imbued with acute olfactory senses, would use their understanding of Genius Society #55 Yu Qingtu's toxic cocktail, the Thalan Toxi-Flame, and introduced other counterfeit drinks such as the Thalan Mysti-Flame, the Thalan Hydro-Flame, and the Thalan Detoxi-Flame, with each of them being entirely harmless and alcohol-free. The fluff ball on top of their heads are capable of moving. Their pattern of movement largely depends on the individual Pepeshi's emotional state and intensity. Darting back and forth indicates anger, twirling back and forth indicates rage, drooping down indicates sadness, and swinging vigorously indicates excitement. A Pepeshi rarely allows anyone to touch their fluff ball as it is an extremely private and intimate gesture. In present-day Penacony, the Pepeshi people labor in economic-related activities under the Alfalfa Family, in construction with the Nightingale Family, or as little Dreamchasers seeking their own goals.

She is known for favoring the internal and self-destruction of mortals. She infiltrated the Xianzhou Luofu to revive the Ambrosial Arbor and start a civil war but was defeated. Profile. Origin. Phantylia belongs to a class of particularly powerful heliobi that have an especially strong sense of self-awareness. Such heliobi are made up of several heliobi who have resolved their differences and fused into an indissoluble whole. Weaker heliobi fear such beings because getting too close to them will cause them to be absorbed by the more powerful heliobus and permanently lose their sense of self, essentially leading to their death. At some point, she caught the attention of Nanook, the Aeon of Destruction and soon proved herself to him, eventually being given the rank of Lord Ravager. The Nameless were aware of her prior to her infiltration of the Xianzhou Luofu. She finds pleasure in causing the self destruction of mortals. She favors causing destruction through internal collapse. Phantylia has stolen many bodies and wishes to obtain an indestructible body but knows that this is impossible. She describes herself as a flame of The Blemished One and that if the fuel ever runs out, the fire will also be extinguished. Activity. The Yuque's Divination Commission believed that an unseen and unidentified Lord Ravager caused chaos on at least 122 planets and their ultimate destruction by the Antimatter Legion over the span of 600 years. All reports attribute their demise to internal conflict, spiritual collapse, loss of trust and hope as the main causes. After Phantylia's invasion of the Luofu, the Alliance eventually concluded that she was this unidentified Lord Ravager. She infiltrated the Luofu disguised as Tingyun with the purpose of destroying the Luofu. She made a deal with Dan Shu, the leader of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, to provide them with a Stellaron and told them that the Ambrosial Arbor would bestow upon them undying bodies once it was revived. She arranged for the Stellaron to be brought aboard the Xianzhou by someone. After Dan Shu was defeated by the Astral Express, she begged Phantylia to uphold their deal. Phantylia ignored her request, instead becoming disgusted as her identity was compromised and she was forced to shed her Tingyun disguise before sending a large group of Antimatter Legion footsoldiers into the Luofu. Phantylia headed to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor and took control of its power and a body created by the Arbor. After the Trailblazers found her, a battle ensued where she tried to convert Jing Yuan into a member of the Antimatter Legion, believing that it would put the Luofu into chaos. In doing so, a mental link was formed between the two, allowing Dan Heng \u2022 Imbibitor Lunae to damage her by attacking Jing Yuan, ejecting her out of her body. Phantylia did not mind, as she had only lost a body stolen on a whim, while taunting Jing Yuan as she wondered how long he would last. Jing Yuan believes that if she had focused on the battle, she would have likely won against them. Heliobus. As a heliobus, Phantylia is capable of possessing bodies, such as that of the Ambrosial Arbor. While not possessing a body, such as directly after discarding her Tingyun disguise and after being defeated, Phantylia takes the form of a bright colored, sentient flame that is capable of speech.

Usage: The idiom stresses the importance of relying on facts and maintaining one's independent thoughts, instead of being swayed by others' opinions. It can also be used to convey the idea that \"seeing something with your own eyes leaves a stronger impression than only hearing about it.\" Example Usage \"I'd long heard of Dragon Spring Brew's deliciousness and was delighted to try it, but I was totally disappointed after ordering at Spices Supreme. Seriously, tasting is believing.\" On Travel: Presenting Gifts. Scenario After Glenn completed the trade applications in the Palace of Astrum and successfuly signed the trade agreements, she wanted to express her gratitude to Han Meimei, who had always supported and helped her. She had brought some snacks from her homeland and wanted to gift those to Han Meimei... Dialogue Han Meimei: \"Congratulations! I heard that you've wrapped up the trade agreement. That's great news. I booked a private room at Spices Supreme to have a celebration together.\" Glenn: \"Thank you, Han Meimei! I really don't know how I can thank you better. I've got some snacks from my homeland here...\" Han Meimei: \"Thank you so much. I'm gonna go ahead and take those!\" Glenn: \"This is but a small gift to communicate my vast appreciation. I hope it's enough.\" Han Meimei: \"Thank you. You're too kind.\" Idiom \"A small gift bears one's vast appreciation\" Meaning: The gift may be small, but the thought weighs heavy. This saying indicates a gift should not be judged by its monetary value, but by the intent behind it. Usage: \"A small gift for one's vast appreciation\" is a humble euphemism that is usually spoken by the giver of the gift. These polite euphemisms do not have much actual value in Xianzhou's socialization etiquette, but their aim is to sound elegant and proper. Therefore, it may be hard for Outworlders to understand how to use them. For the people of Xianzhou, even an expensive gift may be described via this idiom to reduce the value of the gift. Please remember this is not a dishonest statement or an attempt to discredit the gift. The one receiving the gift usually should not use this idiom because it implies you are belittling the gift. That goes against the Xianzhou code of etiquette. Inappropriate Use \"I know this jade abacus is not some rare item, but since you came all the way here to give it to me, I suppose that counts as a small gift that bears vast appreciation.\" On Work: Life in the Workplace. Scenario Claude is an Outworlder seeking employment at the Xianzhou, and was hired recently by Glenn as a foreign trade warehouse manager. He started his job of registering stock at the Trover of Verdure warehouses in Cloudford after passing his interview. However, as he frequently turned up late for work and was distracted during work hours, Glenn prepared to have a serious talk with him... Dialogue Glenn: \"Why are you never at your post when I'm checking up on you?\" Claude: \"The one who seeks can never find what they're seeking, and the one being sought can never encounter the one seeking.\" Glenn: \"If you keep leaving your post, then I'll have to fire you.\" Claude: \"Hahaha, yeah sure.\" Glenn: \"Deal. Your wish is my command.\" Idiom \"Your wish is my command\" Meaning: Rather than showing respect using words, it is best to just obey the other person. Usage: Its original meaning is to accept the goodwill of others instead of politely trying to decline for superficial humility. This is a polite phrase often used after someone gifts you something or shows you favor. The above scenario shows an extension of that use, indicating \"we don't need to be polite to each other anymore.\" The idiom was originally a phrase of humility that can only be applied to oneself in Xianzhou culture. In contrast, there are phrases of respect that can only be used on other people. When living at XIanzhou, one needs to be able to identify the differences between phrases of humility and respect, and avoid situations where the two types of terms are mixed up and misused. Inappropriate Use \"There are 3000 documents here. Please send them to me today after registering them all, and make it so my wish is your command.\""}

I told my father I missed you, so he said I could write to you. As I wrote this letter, my father was reading over my shoulders. I didn't want him to, but he'd probably read it when he mails it for me. So, whatever. It's all your fault that I had a fever lately. I cried for the longest time after you moved away because I thought you'd forgotten me. So imagine my surprise when I received the cookies you sent me a few days ago. I couldn't stop thinking about you, so much so that I couldn't do well on a test. My father said it's just an excuse, but I really do believe that it was your fault. Same as this fever. My father said I could go visit you over the weekend, but we live too far apart. He thought after some time, maybe several months, or the next Solwarm Festival, we'd make new friends, and we'd gradually forget about each other. That's what happened to him when he was younger. When I asked him about it, he looked away and it was only then that I noticed his face had turned red. My mother was reading my letter just now, but now they're gone. I understand why my father is worried. You'd better send cookies to me every week and I'll also write to you. If you think it is unfair, then you can write to me and I'll bake you some cookies. My parents are back now. My mother said it would be nice if we'd work in the same factory. That's where my parents met. Adults think they know everything. They think we want to get married, but our relationship isn't like that at all. They don't know anything about us. Right now, they're giggling to themselves. If I didn't have a fever, I'd write this letter in secret and mail it myself, so they wouldn't be able to read it. I want to become a scientist, capable of creating the largest furnace this world has ever seen. That way, when we go out to the Outer Municipal District, we won't have to wear so many layers of clothing. Do you remember? When we went out there to play, I wore so many layers that I couldn't even put my arms down. We ended up not doing anything fun. When I invent that furnace, we'll play there again. So, I probably won't go to work at the factory. I'm more interested in going to the research institute. If you want to come with me, you can be a scientist. I'll understand if you want to do something else though. That's what makes me different from those adults. I'm a little sleepy as I'm still on medication today. That's all for now. My dad said he'll mail the letter for me later. Arna"}

Regardless of how well you've been, I've been feeling terrible. Well, sorry for taking over a month to reach out to you. Your constant motherly concern always bugs me, like a swarm of mosquitoes at a summer watering hole. Forgive the venom seeping through my pen at the moment, but you once said, \"Perhaps you can rely on your brother a little bit,\" right? So hold off on the complaints and hear me out. I got obsessed with a painter's work a while back \u2014 I'm aware that you know all about it, but just listen up. So, I ended up writing some critique essays about it, using my usual analytical techniques \u2014 the same ones that those idiots in the field love to criticize as \"peeking into the author's privacy and making it public.\" Yeah, that \"psychological topography\" method. Seriously, those old farts really should learn from their late mentors how to shut up and stay calm. They say things like, \"Only lunatics want to reveal themselves unreservedly.\" But we'll see. When their coffins are rotten, which one of those stupid heads won't be exposed nakedly? Anyway, I digress again, so let's circle back to the painter. After the publication of my second essay, the comments section was a total pandemonium \u2014 praises, criticisms, criticisms of those who praised me, criticism of those who criticized me, and even random trolls and onlookers joining the frenzy... But guess what? Perhaps you don't know it yet, the painter, she... actually praised me! Considering my \"reputation\" in the community, genuine praise without sarcasm or flattery is rarer than springtime in Snowland. And her words, though simple, were genuinely inclusive. I may have gotten a bit carried away... but you know what? The idea of having a friend with similar tastes and interests is like having an endless supply of sugar cookies right in front of you! (By the way, the butler told me you've been overindulging in sugar lately. You'd better clean up your act before I get home.) So as you know, moving to Penacony was a hasty decision, I admit, but my passion for art is the only fire in my life. And don't worry, Claudia was with me on this journey. Oh, hold your laughter for a moment! I didn't realize that I had traveled all the way to meet her and ended up leaving before the tea had even cooled. The great painter I admired turned out to be just a housewife with an empty mind and no ambition. All that elegance and goodness of heart? Just a facade, nothing but superficiality! I used to hold this great painter in high regard, but now, her name only reminds me of a worn-out brush. It only comes to life when dipped in the pigment of inspiration, but once the oil is washed away, it becomes pale, stiff, and worthless! Still, I managed to be polite to this so-called \"talented\" lady, and I didn't even say anything mean! We had a polite chat, a polite goodbye, and, believe it or not, she even politely invited me to write another review of her new artwork. Ha, ha, ha! What a perfectly \"polite\" meeting from start to finish! So, Lester, I'm not coming home this month, or the next, or the one after that. I'm taking Claudia on a trip to the neighboring galaxy. I need to forget all about this annoyingly worn-out brush! Louis"}

The month that we've been working together was far too short. The first thing that I noticed about you was your beauty. You are more beautiful than most other women, but not quite as beautiful as my first love. But that's not important. Your real charm is your down-to-earth work attitude, which is the quality a woman in Belobog should have in this new era. The earnest way in which you prepared for interview articles is charming. I was captivated by your clear organization and thoughtful questions. If I were conducting the interview, I would have been more thorough, especially with the improvisation and humor. In the future, feel free to communicate with me and I'd be more than happy to give you constructive feedback, making your work easier. I heard your magazine, \"Voyager\", is a young media company only recently established. Plenty of challenges await in the future. An unwed woman like yourself will surely need an outstanding partner to face those challenges together. Allow me to re-introduce myself. For three consecutive years, I've been voted as the backbone of the magazine, \"Crystal Daily\". Many colleagues call me \"the one who is most daring to speak out.\" Of course, in our line of work, that is a good quality to have. In my spare time, I participate in various sports. I'm exceptionally good at long-distance running and have won many rewards for the suburban snow cross-country. I think you'll find that there aren't many men like me. However, if you do like me, please don't become too attached. Fate guides our love, and we must do our utmost for Belobog. What kind of love would require us to sacrifice our job? What kind of love would have us be filled with guilt and shame? Please respond within 7 days of reading this . Otherwise, I will be too busy to \"*The rest of the torn letter is missing.*\""}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34682","text":"A Letter of Complaint A Letter of Complaint is a readable found on Penacony. Text. Dear Mr. Bloodhound, Greetings, please understand that I write this letter with a sense of guilt and unease. As a Motivator, it is my responsibility to assist those who seek guidance, but I must admit that... I am currently feeling worried, and even scared. It all began two months ago when a guest named Mullich approached me for help. At first, I was slightly surprised when this well-spoken elegant gentleman approached me to ask for a chat, as I wasn't on duty at the time but just happened to be passing by my place of work. However, he then explained that he had seen me at work before, so I didn't doubt his claim. Our conversation was pleasant, and it wasn't until he bid farewell and made arrangements for our next meeting that I realized I had been engaged in \"overtime.\" During our second meeting, we delved into his \"condition.\" However, rather than the medical condition, this gentleman only subtly revealed that he suffered from an incurable disease in reality. As a result, he had been rejected by his family, therefore seeking solace only in the Dreamscape. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for this young, refined gentleman who had to endure such hardships. I offered whatever guidance and solace I could provide. Our conversation extended throughout the entire afternoon, and he eventually disclosed that he was afflicted with severe paranoid schizophrenia, also known as delusional disorder. From the third meeting onward, our discussions started to veer off course, and the topic of \"friends\" arose. Based on our previous conversations, I learned that this gentleman hailed from a wealthy background and had enjoyed a successful career and life before his illness. However, he claimed to have never had any friends. Intrigued, I attempted to use this as a starting point to uncover useful insights and made discreet inquiries, and he surprised me with his response as he appeared more than willing to share his stories. He began recalling his unfortunate childhood, characterized by a cold and harsh father, a mother utterly without her own agency, and insincere and flattering guests. He described his feelings of loneliness and helplessness, explaining how he developed a new persona to keep himself company. At this stage, it became evident to me that this gentleman was indeed grappling with severe delusional behavior, although not specifically schizophrenia as previously mentioned. It seemed as though he deliberately blurred the lines between concepts such as \"schizophrenia\" and \"dissociative identity\" to lend credibility and coherence to his narrative. I followed his train of thought, and he appeared amused, elaborating on the strength and bravery of his self-proclaimed \"other self\" (referred to as \"W\" here) and how it served as his sole guide and companion. By the end of that day, he had developed a notable level of trust and intimacy with me, repeatedly emphasizing that W would hold me in the same regard as he did. We continued to have several more conversations, typically occurring once a week. However, I gradually became aware that this gentleman seemed to be projecting the image of a \"mother\" onto me \u2014 Not his own mother who could make no decisions of her own and never loved him, but an \"anima\" who cares for him, loves him, and will stay with him. This development clearly crossed the line between a guest and a Motivator. To address this situation, I took the following measures. Firstly, I subtly hinted and guided him, making him aware of the risks associated with such a dependent relationship. However, he skillfully avoided any discussions on this topic. Secondly, I began actively reducing the frequency of our meetings, yet he would still show up at my work at the agreed-upon time, whether I was present or not. Lastly, I had no choice but to have another brief conversation with him and firmly express my refusal. During that encounter, he simply stared at me without expression for a while before silently turning away, but I didn't believe that the matter could be resolved so easily. As expected, a few days later, some of my other clients who had sought help from me informed me that they had been stalked and received a threatening letter stitched together from red cut-out letters. \"STAY AWAY FROM RAN. SHE DOES NOT NEED YOU.\u2014W\" The above account details what occurred. At present, I have temporarily appeased this distressed gentleman by actively inviting him to our next meeting, but that's the extent of what I can do. He is not inherently malevolent, and I sincerely hope that we both will break free from this nightmare soon.Ran"}

To the traitor of the school of thought, Firstly, allow me to start this letter by admitting how ashamed I am of my inability to see through people. Once, I regarded you as a close companion and even treated you like my own child. I entrusted you with my authority within the academic community, because I genuinely cared for you and believed in your potential and our shared future. However, it is disheartening to see how you have chosen to repay my kindness \u2014 Without shame, you have stabbed me in the back! Spread malicious rumors! And incited discord! I have heard that you accuse me of fostering a culture of childlike dependence among my students and claim that my paternal authority has hindered your academic growth. As you have come to this conclusion, I will refrain from offering any further defense or judgment. Over the years, I have become accustomed to facing accusations and interrogations from my critics. Yet, when confronted with your misguided statement, I find solace in the fact that our futile relationship has finally come to an end, that we have finally gone our separate ways, and that the deceitful, hypocritical, and ungrateful insect, along with his followers, has departed from my realm of knowledge! The greatest regret of my life is having considered you a friend. This is closely followed by compromising and contorting myself in an attempt to salvage our superficial friendship. In the end, I offer you the following advice \u2014 He who is unable to see the truth claims to be practicing it. Such folly raises doubts about his lack of self-awareness regarding his own foolishness and lack of judgment."}

A Letter to all of Furnace Core Base To all the members of the Furnace Core Research Station: Greetings. I am Klenova, the fourth head of the Geomarrow Development Group. When the Eternal Freeze approached in the past, the Geomarrow stores on the surface were immediately consumed. Under the command of the great Guardian Alisa Rand, humanity began to march towards the unknown deep underground \u2014 That was when the Geomarrow Development Group was created with our great mission. \u2014 If the Belobog historians were to write a record of Geomarrow development, they would likely start from that time point. However, the truth was that another group of pioneering explorers had dug underground before we did, and the arrival of the Eternal Freeze was long after them. The Supreme Guardian made the Geomarrow Development Group an important organization under the command of the Architects. Our job is to always dig deeper and maintain a flow of Geomarrow to the surface so that Belobog can function. But apart from digging for Geomarrow, we have a more important mission: To create a subterranean ecosystem. I have only heard about the sights in the underground from my father's letters. I could not tell what was real amongst his passionate and exaggerated descriptions. And yet, when I actually had the chance to join the Group and start exploring, I finally discovered the things he said were no illusions. The Group and I discovered a final, unsent letter when we were sorting out his belongings. He wrote: \"...Nova, I had never mentioned this to you, but I spent my childhood in the mountains far from Belobog. At that time, I felt the entire world belonged to me, and I could go anywhere I wanted. However, after the Eternal Freeze arrived, children of your generation never left Belobog.\" \"I thought perhaps we will discover oceans and mountain ranges underground. Perhaps, in the future, we can also live underground...\" \"I really hope I can see that day together with you.\" I had kept all of the letters he sent me, including this one. I remember his wish and I know I must fulfill it \u2014 With the Furnace Core research station as a base, we will keep excavating Geomarrow mines. At the end of this year, we will formally establish the first underground mining town. That is, however, only the first step. I hope more towns will appear underground in Belobog in the future, and we might even build cities as beautiful as the Overworld. We might even connect all the regions above ground and underground using train rails, so the old world and the new would not be separated... \u2014 At that time, we will no longer have to crouch in tiny shelters to evade the snow, and will find where we truly belong in this new world. At the same time, the historical mission of the Group is about to come to an end. The information we gathered will be used to explore the future, including our geological, mineralogical, and biological data including the knowledge on flora, fauna, and micro-organisms. As of now, most of us will temporarily return to our respective institutes for scientific research. But personally, I will definitely return to the underground after I retire in a few years. Therefore, there is no need to feel sad for the coming farewell. Simply wait till the Supreme Guardian renovates this place into the first transport channel connecting above and below ground. This small Furnace Core base will be completely changed and continue to shine for the mission of underground exploration. Until that time, our friend big Svarog will protect this place for us, so the traces we leave behind won't disappear. We know that though he doesn't talk much, he has always protected us with great loyalty. I believe he will keep his promise this time as well. He is our best compatriot. Everything with a beginning has an end. Now is the time to say goodbye. I salute you all, the Geomarrow Development Group, and all members of the Furnace Core Research Station!

Cleo, I hope this letter finds you well. First and foremost, I hereby declare: I voluntarily relinquish any right to claim remuneration from Scholar Cleo regarding this article. Please go through the necessary formalities, apply for the allowance, and come to the Xianzhou Luofu immediately. As mentioned in my previous letters, I have tried my best to study the Xianzhou natives and Foxians, but I can't seem to find a suitable long-life individual. So, I have turned my attention to the Vidyadhara. As you know, the Vidyadhara has a unique bodily structure. Their life cycle will keep going, thus they are free of the problems of aging, death, and being mara-stricken. Some researches point out that the immortality of the of the Vidyadhara is not due to Abundance, with which I agree. I have probably put too much focus on the Power of Abundance that I miss out on the clue that can lead to a breakthrough in my study. There's no point in dwelling on this, actually. Even if we could have gotten things right sooner, we would have had little chance to collect samples. After all, the Vidyadhara rarely leaves their Xianzhou ship. Based on their physical needs and traditional customs, they need to return to a special region, called the ancient sea, for their hatching rebirth. Having overcome a series of obstacles, I finally found a biological sample of the Vidyadhara in the Scalegorge Waterscape. The value of this sample was beyond my expectation. To put it simply, it showed me a clear direction toward immortality. I reckon that my teacher, Bernini, went into seclusion because he wanted to keep the secret to himself. I don't blame him, seeing how tempting immortality is. I won't include too many technical details here, as too much is at stake. I'll explain to you face-to-face when you reach the Luofu. The time we have spent on the path of Erudition has been nearly a century, and my age is starting to catch up on me. As I start to think slower, I become less efficient in my research... Yet the cosmos is still vast, and there is a lot more for us to explore and create. Yet, we're running out of time. But now, everything is different. If my research is heading in the right direction (which I am 80% sure), we will not only be entitled to wealth and fame, but also an unlimited supply of time to explore the boundless space in which countless intellectual treasures are hidden. P.s.: I'm thinking of recruiting a smart and reliable junior frater, named (Trailblazer), for you. Please work with when you arrive in the Luofu. Your dearest teacher, Todd Riordan"}

At the moment, a graceful young lady was standing at the end of the corridor, like a sharp sword unleashing from its sheath. Countless spots of light encircled her, like stars breathing and dancing in the universe. If you look closer, you may find that the light spots are sealed in a translucent jar, like shrines immured on walls. \"These viscera essences...\" The wolf-head Master uttered, \"So they are what you obtained from the divine relic.\" \"The long-life master only granted us power, but cultivated the seed of the sacred tree in you. How unfair...\" \"I put thirty thousand people to death and had the anatomist dissect their live viscera essences for these viscera shrines. I've made further studies of them.\" \"My studies have proven me right. The heart is for the sake of sustaining life, and viscera essence is to absorb power from the root.

He inhaled deeply, as if he could consume all the air within this narrow space. In seconds, his hunched body expanded muscle by muscle, and turned into a huge iron tower of flesh. The cracking bones and warping flesh generated a sharp and painful noise during the deformation, and quickly healed. The wolf-head man has long been used to these pains. As he breathed, a weak glimmer of light overflowed from his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears. His viscera essence started to shine brightly. \"This armor fits well my blood and flesh. It is like it were an organ attached to my body. However, its prowess is yet to be tested.\" \"My opponents have all turned into balls of flesh with just one blow. Maybe the High-Cloud Quintet can help me know its true limit!\" The lady's eyes were as dark and cold as ice, as if the things happening in front of her were dull and uninteresting. Thirty thousand soldiers, thirty thousand viscera essences, viscera essence kindles of life... She tried not to get distracted by the cruelty of the miracle before her eyes. The subtle balance between the two sides is hard to maintain. One would take their advantage precisely when they get the chance. The wold-head man soared forward as a mass of gray storm.

The Dragon Lady has disappeared! This morning I brought her favorite breakfast for the high elder and found her missing! I've searched everywhere for her... the Medicine Bureau, the Elixir Research Terrace, the Medical Pavilion... but I can't find her! Have you seen her? I found out that all the starskiffs in delve had gone missing, and I couldn't get a response to my messages to the Realm-Keeping Commission. The chief alchemist, chief healer, and lead medical assistant were all out of town for a meeting, so I couldn't report to anyone. Will any kindhearted friend from the Alchemy Commission help me? Signed, Lingering Clouds Relax, she is probably skipping home again. How many times do we have to do the whole shebang for this little girl? No more serious work to be done? I think we should just keep doing our work at hand, and then maybe one day she'll just quietly come back. Hey, just like when finding lost things, when you don't go looking for it, it'll just appear on its own. It always turns out that way, right guys? Signed, Unconcerned in the Medical Hut Hey previous commenter, I hope you show the most basic respect to the high elder. She is the rightful leader of the Vidyadhara after that man! And I think she's doing a much better job than that so-called great hero. It's also because of the Dragon Lady's genius that we've been able to make progress in many of our prescription research. Even the chief alchemist also said that the Dragon Lady's capabilities are immeasurable. Signed, Peeved Bald Healer I understand. I'm just tired of this childish drama. The high elder is not merely a mascot, but should carry herself like someone deserving of the title of high elder. I'm maybe a few years older than you, so I have seen that person's heroism in battle with my own eyes. Signed, Unconcerned in the Medical Hut Yeah, and then he got locked up. How many of our people were never able to undergo hatching rebirth again because of his one decision? In my opinion, the current high elder may not have defeated any abominations, or vanquished any evils, or stepped up for Vidyadhara affairs... But her efforts in saving lives and healing the wounded is a hundred times better than those Preceptors and that so-called hero! Signed, Thunderous Scalegorge Tides You guys... Stop arguing!

Teacher says, if people don't remember where they come from, then they'll be similarly confused about which direction they should go. School's out, so I've come to the Scalegorge Waterscape to find out about the history of us Vidyadharas. In our textbooks, we come out of a primordial ocean just like this one \u2014 but far vaster than the tiny reaches of these Lunarescent Depths. There is an ocean as far as the eye can see \u2014 covering up the entire planetary surface. Our ancestors lived a carefree life together in the Roiling Deep there with countless other living things. Back then, we could still use the power gifted to us by our dragon ancestor, Long. As the prime species among those sea creatures in the Roiling Deep, everything was within our control. If a fish species was too bony, we'd remove the bones from inside their body. If a sea beast was too small, we'd fatten it up and make it proliferate. If a seaweed was too bitter, we'd sweeten it until it was delicious. Teacher says that back then, we could use our powers derived from Long to change the form of any creature, as easily as children playing with modeling clay. Our ancestors could modify fish into a thick mountain of meat, gouging meat from this hill whenever they wanted a bite to eat. Back then, crabs could have thousands of legs, each leg filled with delicious crab meat. I wish that we could go back to those days, but teacher says that we'll never be able to go back. One day, when we could no longer control the powers of our dragon ancestor, all of the creatures in the entire ocean became our enemies. The fish were toxic, the sea beasts hostile, and even the seaweed could prey upon us. Later on, even the microscopic creatures in the Roiling Deep became dangerous. They multiplied until the oceans were no longer fit for our survival. Even later on, we became a member of the Xianzhou Alliance. Life is good aboard the Xianzhou, but the freedom of the ocean is something we will never recover. But teacher also says that people should live with the future in mind, and we shouldn't suffocate ourselves with nostalgia. So I believe that even though we'll never be able to go back to our ocean home, so long as I can qualify into adulthood, then I will definitely build a more beautiful future than the past."}

Brief Introduction. &lt;section begin=\"Penacony Introduction\" \/&gt; Penacony is a prestigious paradise of pleasure in the vast cosmos. On the famous planet of festivities, a magnificent hotel stands as a magnet for tourists seeking to indulge in the land of dreams. Within a world comprised of twelve distinct Dreamscapes, Penacony thrives, boasting its own unique cultures that offer happiness around the clock. A neverending banquet of extravagance is about to begin. &lt;section end=\"Penacony Introduction\" \/&gt; &lt;section begin=\"Dreamscape Introduction\" \/&gt; The true essence of Penacony resides not within the colossal floating hotel but rather within the boundless dream world comprised of twelve Dreamscapes. Originally a prison under the jurisdiction of IPC, housing countless inmates, it has now transformed into a utopia under the management of the Family. Here, both locals and outsiders can revel in blissful dreams, unburdened by any concerns. &lt;section end=\"Dreamscape Introduction\" \/&gt; Dream Bubble. &lt;section begin=\"Dream Bubble\" \/&gt; Dream bubbles, commonly found throughout Penacony, are a special kind of memory bubble. Unprocessed dream bubbles often carry intense emotional imprints, while those regulated by the Family can be safely used to record dreams, making them one of Penacony's most intriguing specialties. These dream bubbles exist in various shapes, including round, fish-shaped, whale-shaped, and much more. &lt;section end=\"Dream Bubble\" \/&gt; A Child's Dream. Enigmatic spaces exist in the Dreamscape. Among them, \"A Child's Dream\" emanates an eerie aura. Who created this realm? And for what purpose...? Story Guide. Invited by the Family, the Astral Express and its crew make their way to Penacony, a planet once visited by Akivili, the Aeon of Trailblaze. Upon arrival, they are greeted by senior members of the Family and the IPC. While the opulent ambiance of the Reverie Hotel impresses everyone, Himeko senses that something is amiss with the planet. To unravel the secrets of this realm and uncover the legacy of the Watchmaker, a legendary figure with extraordinary power, the Crew ventures into the Dreamscape. However, just as the Trailblazer prepares to enter the Dreamscape, Aventurine, a major IPC executive, reappears before them, extending an invitation with a certain purpose in mind... Upon awakening within the Dreamscape, the Trailblazer encounters a mysterious voice and discovers a note offering guidance on the Watchmaker. Later, guided by Misha, a hotel bellboy, the Trailblazer enters the Golden Hour, only to find themselves soaring through the sky of this splendid city. Descending onto a plaza, the Trailblazer encounters Robin and Sunday, two prominent figures within the Family. As the Trailblazer embarks on their trailblazing expedition in Penacony, a world where individuals from various major factions converge, what stories will unfold? Key Words. &lt;section begin=\"The Family\" \/&gt; A collective force that reveres Xipe the Harmony.

They use their harmonious melody to call out to other worlds, extending an invitation to embrace the Harmony. In the loving radiance of Xipe, all those chosen become part of the Family, regardless of their diverse origins and civilizations, immersed in the comforting warmth of Harmony. The Family within Penacony is divided into five major branches, each responsible for distinct aspects of governance. The Oak Family establishes rules and regulations. The Nightingale Family oversees dream construction and research. The Alfalfa Family manages the economic system. The Bloodhound Family upholds law and order. And lastly, the Iris Family entertains visitors and oversees the entertainment industry.

However, these Dreamweavers, who have already established their reputation in Penacony, possess strong personalities and pursue their individual ambitions, making cooperation a challenge. Acknowledging this, the Family maintains close supervision and facilitates skilled negotiations to ensure smooth progress in their constructive efforts. &lt;section end=\"Dreamweavers\" \/&gt; &lt;section begin=\"Halovian\" \/&gt; A revered race esteemed for their enchanting voices and captivating appearance, widely adored throughout the universe.

Despite the mystery surrounding his origins, individuals arriving in Penacony from other worlds seek to emulate his success. Rumors suggest that during the final stage of the journey, the Crew will have an opportunity to uncover the Watchmaker's secrets. &lt;section end=\"The Watchmaker\" \/&gt; &lt;section begin=\"Dream's Edge\" \/&gt; An area currently under development by Dreamweavers, inaccessible to the public. Most of the overlapping complexes are still undergoing construction, with only 30% to 40% of the project completed, resulting in unfinished roads scattered throughout. Visitors may catch glimpses of the city's planned framework, but more often than not, they are met with unsettling and bizarre phenomena. &lt;section end=\"Dream's Edge\" \/&gt; The Reverie. &lt;section begin=\"The Reverie\" \/&gt; The Reverie serves as the primary structure in Penacony's physical realm and acts as a prominent landmark within the Dreamscape, serving as a bridge between the two realms. Guests enter the Dreamscape by sleeping at the Reverie. The hotel is divided into 48 sectors based on orientation and floor level, each with its own central lobby. Notably, sectors 10 to 12 are known as the Platinum Suites. When guests fall asleep and awaken in the Dreamscape, they will find themselves in a distinctive hotel that differs from its real-world counterpart. &lt;section end=\"The Reverie\" \/&gt; Central Lobby. &lt;section begin=\"Central Lobby\" \/&gt; The central lobby boasts a magnificent clock as its centerpiece.

The Crew encounters a minor issue upon reaching the central lobby. Since the Trailblazer was not part of the Crew when the invitations were sent out, there is no room reserved for them. Nevertheless, with the assistance of Aventurine, Sunday, and Robin, the Crew manages to complete their check-in process. Guest Room. &lt;section begin=\"Guest Room\" \/&gt; A perfectly serene room for a good night's dream.

They have been tamed by the Family to serve the guests, collectively referred to as the Sweet Dreams Troupe.

Consequently, the Sweet Dreams Troupe may reveal their monstrous side, becoming the Dreamjolt Troupe and wreaking havoc. Influenced by the hedonistic atmosphere of Penacony, these service robots continue to fulfill their roles even in the state of the Dreamjolt Troupe. However, to regular visitors, their \"performances\" are nothing but acts of sabotage. &lt;section end=\"Dreamjolt Troupe\" \/&gt; \"\u203b The content on this page is concept art and may differ from the final in-game content.\""}

An enigmatic and prolific figure, The Watchmaker holds significant importance to the founding and history of Penacony, becoming the symbol of dreams for those who come to pursue his legacy. Despite his status and stories being passed down over generations, many have begun to doubt his existence, believing him to be a conceptual construct of The Family.

Firefly speculates that The Watchmaker may have been a Nameless, which is later revealed to be true. Story. Mikhail Char Legwork was born on the oceanic world of Lushaka, where he was adopted by two legendary seafarers named Mikhail and Char. At some point when Falcon Amundsen was the Navigator, he joined the Nameless and boarded the Astral Express. His adventures with the Nameless came to an end when they visited Penacony. He and his fellow crewmates Tiernan and Razalina decided to stay, as they wished to help the planet and its people recover from the Stellaron corrosion. Before he left the Express, the then Nagivator Granholm entrusted Falcon's hat to him. Through his influence, the Dreamscapes of Penacony soon began to display many incredulous objects and phenomena, such as \"teapots that can tell jokes, race cars that twirl as they drive, and mansions that switch their location every day\". Many began to desire the Dreamscapes to experience these luxuries. Shortly after his passing, his Trailblazing will summoned A Child's Dream and was subsequently incarnated into Misha. In, invitations are sent to various factions throughout the universe to celebrate Charmony Festival on Penacony. However, these invitations contained a hidden message: \"...Witness the impossible in the realm of dreams, find the legacy of the Watchmaker, Father of Penacony, and thus the answer to the question: Why does life slumber.\" To that end, various factions and individuals are in pursuit of the Watchmaker's legacy and the truth of the Dreamscape.

The Daiyu had a species of angelica that it shared its name with. History. During the Lone Voyage Era when Xianzhou was wandering around, the population of the Daiyu, along with the Yuanqiao, once declined drastically due to the corrosion of viscorpuses, a Denizen of Abundance race. Around the Year 1200 Star Calendar, the The Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart. Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague and the Daiyu exploded during the campaign against the Viscorpus. The remains of the Daiyu ended up crashing into the ocean world of Thalassa, and became the center of the native Insumousu civilization after their homes were destroyed in the fall. The ship became known as a celestial palace and its inhabitants revered as fallen gods for many generations. The event became known as the Divine Fall and was celebrated as Divine Fall Day. The Alliance eventually established contact with Insumousu and began trade and diplomatic relations with them and upon knowing the truth of the Xianzhou, no longer had a religious view on the Daiyu and its people, though they still revered them. With the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration \u2014 People would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=8633","text":"The Xianzhou Fanghu is one of the six Flagships owned by the Hexafleet of the Xianzhou Alliance. It is headed by the \"Seiche Queller\", Xuanquan. The Fanghu's specialty export are marine products and they have a native species of seahorse. On the Fanghu, the High Elder Glaciator Marum governs over all citizens, and the Six Charioteers and Six Commissions support the High Elder. It is because of their influence that the Pearlkeepers aboard the Fanghu formed an elite force that have essentially replaced the role of the Cloud Knights there. Description. The Fanghu is an autonomous dominion of the Vidyadhara, and thusly has different customs, culture, and social structures from other Xianzhou ships. Reading materials such as the Fanghu Lifestyle Guide from the Star-Picking Tours are recommended to avoid unintended mistakes. Vidyadhara roaming around the Miniature Myriads and Pearlkeepers meditating are common sights on the Fanghu. The sound of belligerent dragon chants echoes through space from time to time. According to the regional policy, a Xianzhou Alliance Travel Pass and a Fanghu Travel Pass, which must be applied for two-to-three months in advance, are required to travel in the Fanghu. The same rules apply to Xianzhou citizens. Those whose residency papers are under the jurisdiction of the Xianzhou Alliance are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by the Realm-Keeping Commission of their domicile to the Sky-Faring Commission of the Fanghu. Travelers from other worlds are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by their place of residence and the certificate of no criminal record issued by the IPC. Though this procedure is slightly complicated, the Fanghu-issued travel pass remains valid for 20 years, so the process does not have to be repeated often. The Xianzhou Fanghu used to be the most famous tourist attraction of the Xianzhou Alliance. Unfortunately, the place could no longer accommodate vast numbers of tourists in recent years, and even stopped issuing new travel passes briefly due to the damage inflicted by the Third Abundance War. After the new travel policy was put into place, the ship opened up to visitors once more. Vidyadhara on the Fanghu enjoy a number of welfare benefits compared to other Xianzhou ships. For example, on the Fanghu, upon completing their hatching rebirth, the newborn Vidyadhara is immediately assigned a new residence without having to go through the standard real estate paperwork, which is an inconvenience to Vidyadhara who cannot keep track of their past lives. It is said that in regards to registering hatching rebirths, the Fanghu's Realm-Keeping Commission is more competent. Additionally, the water quality on the Fanghu is said to be better than other Xianzhou ships. Areas. Claretgleam Bay. The Claretgleam Bay in the Sanze Delve is the first stop for most travelers who visit the Fanghu. Many are immediately impressed by the water that flows peacefully on top of the dome of the delve the moment they disembark from their starskiffs. Many might have already witnessed this scene through an immersia or hologram before their arrival. Shangguan Sea Snakes can be seen gliding past with their massive bodies, along with the Lantern Fish sparkling like fireflies when they huddle together, and the Srimanth Conches hunting for schools of fish like nimble missiles. Reignbow's Road Museum. The Reignbow's Road Museum is located in the East Sea Delve. Its name in full is \"Third Abundance War Reignbow's Road Museum.\" As the entire East Sea Delve was razed to the ground during the war, the museum was built upon the ruins. In Reignbow's Road Museum, a holographic History of Reignbow's Road formed using the Vidyadhara's cloudhymn magic is displayed. The exhibit shows how the catastrophe took place and how the Abundance Axis launched an aggressive attack against the Fanghu, and how the Pearlkeepers put up a tenacious defense, but to no avail as the Abundance Axis managed to invade the delve in the end. To prevent further destruction, the Reignbow Arbiter appeared to wipe out the fleet of the Abundance Axis with divine arrows and annihilated many corrupted delves. Among them, East Sea Delve was the only one that was simply \"reduced to ruins.\" What is described as the most stunning exhibition hall in the museum is the Palace of Mortal World, where the Fanghu and IPC have built a replica of Moundfish Avenue, the busiest area in East Sea Delve before the war. The daily lives of the 39,823 residents is manifested in the form of Mirage Echoes showing their comings and goings prior to the disaster. The Mirage Echoes can hold conversation, and are described as ordinary people who probably never expected they would perish during the war. Reignbow's Road Museum offers free entry to travelers as the citizens of Fanghu want to show more people the purpose behind the Xianzhou Alliance's endeavors. Wild Shore. The Wild Shore is the most renowned beach in the Fanghu. Despite the complicated travel pass application procedure, the attraction still welcomes almost 70 million travelers every year. The biggest appeal of the Wild Shore is that it is both a hot spring and a beach. The water there is rich in microbes beneficial for the health of one's skin, and the shore is blessed with a magnificent stretch of white sand and beautiful natural scenery. However, its extreme popularity is its most significant drawback as aside the off-season, the sands are crowded with tourists. Alchemy Commission. In front of the entrance to the Fanghu's Alchemy Commission stands a statue of dragon scale coral. Underneath it, there is an inscription that reads: \"When you mistakenly believe you can control nature, always remember: nature is the ultimate biochemist.\" History. In the Theophany Era, on December, Year 2607 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Fanghu, alongside the Yaoqing and Zhuming, introduced its own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. During the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree called Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars. As if attracted by the power of the Ambrosial Arbor on the Luofu, Muldrasil began to approach it, and war broke out between the Xianzhou and the Denizens of Abundance residing in the tree. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation were released to counter the invasion \u2014 including the Reignbow, who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu, which was the third-furthest away in the battle formation. The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, severing the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing: \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Xianzhou Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara, and the five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. Glaciator Marum was bound to watch over the Miniature Myriads on the Fanghu. As a reward, the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Xianzhou Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship. During an unnamed conflict on Thalassa, the Fanghu's Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet was considered for deployment, as they had Vidyadhara cloudhymn magi capable of stopping the Devil's Tide. Ultimately, the Generals decided to use the Crane Feather Orbit Fleet of the Yaoqing instead, as the Fanghu was too far away, and current forces would've had to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before the Fanghu arrived. At some point in history, the Fanghu, alongside the Yaoqing and Zhuming, engaged in warfare against Lord Ravager Celenova and her troops. In the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of the living planet Ketu Mirage, and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight, but they were still in a dire situation. Fu Xuan and Jing Yuan, a Diviner and Arbiter-General of the Luofu, came up with a plan to contact the Reignbow Arbiter using the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. Ever since the Third Abundance War, the Fanghu had adopted self-preservation policies to recuperate. As a result, they had cut off most of their regular communications and trade with the other Xianzhou ships, a decision from the Fanghu's high elder implicitly stemming from the Vidyadhara's inability to produce offspring. After the new travel policy was put into place, the ship opened up to visitors once more. On April, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Fanghu announced on the Yellowbell system that they were currently moored at the Lanadi star system in the Tlaltecuhtli star cluster, a system with no terrestrial planets, except for one with a rudimentary ecosystem. The Fanghu had determined this to be a hidden star system with no ecosphere within several light years' range, meaning it could easily evade attacks from the Denizens of Abundance or the Antimatter Legion. Presently the Fanghu is expected to moor there for some ten Star Calendar years, unless unforeseen circumstances are to transpire."}

The Trailblaze Mission Chapters Windswept Wanderlust, Topclouded Towerthrust and Karmic Clouds Faded, War Banners Folded take place in this world. Geography. From the outside, the Luofu resembles an enormous Starskiff, its deck covered with several large, connected domes - each containing a different delve of the ship. 3\/4 down the hull is a large ring which circles nearly the entire ship, save for a gap at the top. Floating between this gap is the \"Jade Gate\", the main point of entry and exit for anyone visiting the massive ship. The inside of the Luofu comprises of delves which total space exceeds the ship in size. This is possible due to the Xianzhou's space-folding technology. These delves all varied in size and shape, but they were all on a scale that was just too large for any normal ship to contain. Some of the delves could hold up entire residential and commercial districts, such as Exalting Sanctum, while others could even contain vast luxuriant prairies like the Ever-Hunt Plains, which hosts fauna such as monkeys and fawn. The Xianzhou also rears several other animals such as the, , and . The visible space in the bustling skyport of Central Starskiff Haven is enough to fill up the entire Luofu. The bustling street of Starwatcher Avenue can also be found here, where shops line the road for as far as the eye can see, and their lights are lit for perpetuity. The Sky-Faring Commission's headquarters on the Luofu is the Palace of Astrum, which also acts as the ship's bridge. Cloudford is the trade cargo port of the Loufu. With the arrival of numerous Outworlders, Starskiff Haven is alive with people from all walks of life. Goods from various worlds are delivered by transport starskiffs and unloaded at Cloudford, and every day it unceasingly handles huge amounts of port traffic. Starskiffs on the Luofu are manufactured in Stargazer Navalia. Aurum Alley is the Exalting Sanctum's signature food street where tourists come to enjoy delicious food, from traditional dishes to roadside snacks, and experience street culture. The freight dock managed by the Aurum Alley Merchant Guild is mainly used for distributing commodities and logistics transportation. Fyxestroll Garden is garden delve created centuries ago by Foxian crafters temporarily occupied by the Ten-Lords Commission as the imprisonment site for Heliobi that escaped from the Artisanship Commission's Creation Furnace. Within the courtyard walls between the thresholds of Locufox Forest and Foxsomn Tomb lies a forest of bamboo sprouting from bewildering stones. Upon these rocks exists a place of condolence for those in grief to expel their pain. The outside of the Pavilion of Cessation, the Ten-Lords Commission Special Operations Team for the Heliobi Containment Breach Incident's meeting point, forms a corridor decked with sittable sills between the pillars. This offers people a place to rest for a moment and enjoy the coolness or hide from the rain. Additionally, they may also direct their attention toward the Pavilion of Fragrance and appreciate ongoing operatic performances. The Swallowsong Pavilion is for banquets and composing poetry in Fyxestroll Garden. In ancient times, those of literary virtue enjoyed coming to the pavilion to exchange cups of libations and engage in poetic construction, naming this place to be a \"sanctum of wine and lyricality.\" Craftsmen seized the opportunity to circulate the running waters through the confines of the park from the water-facing Verdant Terrace entrance and let nature flourish in sprouts of bamboo and thickets of flora elegance, instilling the richness of rustic woodland upon the area. The Divination Commission hosts the Luofu's Matrix of Prescience Ultima. Conclave Hall is the official location in the Divination Commission delve where issues are discussed publicly. The Seat of Divine Foresight is office of the Arbiter-General of the Luofu. The Luofu's Alchemy Commission borders the Vidyadhara delve of Scalegorge Waterscape which hosts the sealed entrance to the Ambrosial Arbor, the Luofu's Plaguemark. The Alchemy Commission's medical texts are kept in the Elixir Research Terrace, a building looking out over the sea. Medicine and traders flock to Healer's Market. In the past, only Elixir Seekers with permits could enter here to buy divine medicines. Healers gather to conduct medical research in the Medicine Bureau. The tree in its garden is one of Ambrosial Arbor's roots. A statue of Imbibitor Lunae can be found at Dragonvista Rain Hall, which sits the entrance to the Ancient Sea Palace Ruins. The enormous dragon palace of the Vidyadhara is buried in the seafloor valley, along with many Vidyadhara eggs preparing for hatching-rebirth. Hindered by the seal, the Ambrosial Arbor's roots curl into a dragon-shaped wood gall at the Palace Ruin Depths, and no longer grows."}

Description. The master of the Abundance buried the seed of karma in the center of the Xianzhou Luofu and gifted the Elixir Seekers with something named \"Ambrosial Arbor,\" which was considered a miracle as people were able to immediately understand its implications. The Ambrosial Arbor grew fruits of divinity that brimmed with life and vitality, containing the Endless Lifespan sought by the Elixir Seekers. From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor. However, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals. The celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumaton and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves. In desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it. It attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of the Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again. Fortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree. The people had vowed to cast this source of all distortions into the end of all things."}

Description. Thousands of years ago, the Xianzhou Luofu set sail from an ancient nation, crossing deep space to seek an audience with a god in pursuit of the elixir of immortality. The dreadnought enclosing entire biospheres lumbered into the starry sky like a lucid moon silently falling into the night, embarking on an endless and aimless journey. In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality. After voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of the Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship \u2014 the Luofu seemed to be brought to life. Those who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality. Yet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity. In the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The Foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance. Prosperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life. Immortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity. It would only take any traveling merchant mere seconds to feel the marks left by the passage of time on this ark."}

These traits of hers can be seen in the Yaoqing's aggressive pursuit of Abominations of Abundance, as they once secured victory against five different abomination forces within a single year, 8098 Star Calendar. The Yaoqing is noted for its martial prowess and is rarely rivaled. Description. Many travelers have asked if it is safe to travel to the Xianzhou Yaoqing. However, the military operations of the Yaoqing is mainly done by the expeditionary fleet and will not endanger the main ship. Of course, that doesn't mean the Denizens of Abundance will not target the ship, which they describe as a \"catastrophe\". It is said that no enemies have ever managed to deal any substantial damage to the Yaoqing's main ship since the last Amber Era. It is still vital for travelers to strictly abide by the Yaoqing's regulations during the trip. The ship advances at a dazzling speed, carrying the momentum of tempest and thunder. Countless Foxians, fully armed, stand on the deck in a majestic posture. No unnecessary extra procedures are needed to visit the Xianzhou Yaoqing. As long as you are a Xianzhou Alliance citizen or a holder of the Xianzhou Alliance Travel Pass or Resident Permit, you are allowed to visit the Yaoqing. Considering that the Yaoqing is often sailing through active war zones, it is advised to prepare more safety measures before departure. A Yaoqing tour is available with Star-Picking Tours. It is still vital for travelers to strictly abide by the Yaoqing's regulations during the trip. Unauthorized departure from the tour group may constitute a violation of law or even a criminal offense. The Foxians of the Xianzhou Yaoqing are known for their adventuring flying families. The most renowned of these families was that of Baiheng's. There is a Royal Academy on the Yaoqing that Mr. Xiyan studied at. The Xianzhou Yaoqing had much closer ties with the IPC than the Xianzhou Luofu. Initially, people thought they were just engaging in a little interstellar investment but over time, things changed. Gradually, the Yaoqing's younger generations began to enjoy the immersia produced by the IPC's Entertainment Division. Once they started wearing IPC clothing lines, it was hard to tell if they were Xianzhou locals or IPC employees. After their Coming of Age Ceremonies, many youths aspired to join the IPC to make it big. The architecture across the whole delve began to change. The graceful flying eaves, glazed tiles and Fallow Earth bricks were slowly replaced by sleek, monolithic IPC buildings. Many of the Yaoqing locals older than 500 would say the Yaoqing has changed, though they're not sure whether this change would lead to a better future, or if it would allow short-life species to dictate their way of life, causing anxiety amongst the populace. Cloud poria grown on the Yaoqing can be used for Stone Calf Cimicifugae Infusion. The Longevity Pill of Cruelty is a medicine exclusive to the Yaoqing that is said to have the effect of improving overall fitness and rendering those who take it immune to all diseases for a short period of time. It was rumored military rations aboard the Yaoqing include dried Mineshrooms. Areas. Caelorum Venti Pavilion. The Caelorum Venti Pavilion in Moon Delve is one of the most well-known tourist sites of the Yaoqing. The place commemorates how the previous Caelorum Venti, high elder of the Yaoqing, fought valiantly and slew an herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the pavilion with large slabs of jade and moonstone. It is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style, and it is said no language can describe its exquisiteness and grandeur adequately. Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment. Verdant Harbor. The Verdant Harbor in the Verdant Delve showcases the Yaoqing's unique starskiff manufacturing process. A guide can take visitors through the entire place to see how the \"furry little creatures\" grow to become loyal partners of the Verdant Knights that are capable of eradicating abominations. New starskiffs are born almost every day. With the help of the staff, Star-Picking Tours visitors can get the chance to deliver a new starskiff and experience the \"miracle of biotechnology\". Visitors might even get to name the new starskiff, which may be seen eliminating Denizens of Abundance on the battlefield in a few short months. Red Fox Theater. Described as an elegant and soothing activity, the most authentic and traditional \"Pacify Play\" on Baiheng Street is available at Red Fox Theater. Pacify Play is a traditional theater performance of the Yaoqing Foxians. The theater's stage is described as vast and circular. They need a large stage to be able to showcase all elements of the play as the Red Fox Theater is one of the few that rejects the use of special effects to preserve their millennium-old traditions. This type of traditional opera uses different types of facial makeup to differentiate the characters and their personalities, so it requires some prior knowledge to be able to understand the story. Still, it is said that there should be no problem experiencing the charm of the play as it boasts super-realistic stage combat scenes where dozens of actors will find themselves moving around in midair, or acting out gunfights and physical struggles. History. In the Theophany Era, on December, Year 2607 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Yaoqing, alongside the Fanghu and Zhuming, introduced its own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. During the Three Sufferings Era on August, Year 3063 Star Calendar, a businessman is assassinated aboard the Yaoqing, plunging everyone into turmoil. At some point after that, the first case of mara-struck is recorded in history, the Yaoqing's Master of the Delves Changhuan, when he celebrated his thousandth birthday party. On May, Year 3290 Star Calendar, during the aurumaton revolt, Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, leads a force of brave fighters aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. The combined forces team up and launch an offensive operation, smashing them to smithereens. During the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium \u2014 Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war breaks out as a result. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation are released to counter the invasion \u2014 including the Reignbow who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, which was closest to Muldrasil in the battle formation and usied their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu. The arrow smashes into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrating Muldrasil. In The Year 4800 of the Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Caelorum Venti was bound to watch over the Lunar Embryo on the Yaoqing. At some point, Caelorum Venti fought and slew a herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the Caelorum Venti Pavilion in the Moon Delve with large slabs of jade and moonstone to commemorate the event. After the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae in the Year 7379 Star Calendar, Caelorum Venti made a deal with the Xianzhou Alliance that the Imbibitor Lunae of the Luofu, Dan Feng, was to be spared from death and instead suffer the punishment of molting rebirth, where he should have been regarded as a new being and his sins forgiven. However, the Ten-Lords Commission detained him in the Shackling Prison and General Jing Yuan banished him from the Luofu. The Yaoqing laid out an encirclement and eradication of abominations in coordination with the Yuque's defense during an unnamed conflict on Thalassa. The Crane Feather Orbit Fleet of the Yaoqing was deployed instead of the Fanghu as they were too far away, and the current forces would have to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before the Fanghu arrived. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa. At some point in history, the Yaoqing, alongside the Fanghu and Zhuming, engaged in warfare against Lord Ravager Celenova and her troops. On the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of Ketu Mirage; the roaming star and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight but they were still facing defeat. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, During the course of this battle, the Xianzhou Luofu lost over 63,000 fighter jets and over 120,000 pilots, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves are destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. The extent of the damage to the Yaoqing's forces is unknown. On a regular transmission on May, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Yaoqing reported a resounding victory against Fallomom's abominations. On June of that year, they secured a resounding victory against Toste-VIII's abominations. On October that year, they secured a resounding victory against Sakin Chadu's abominations, victory was uncertain until support from the Interastral Peace Corporation arrived. Madam Yukong advised the Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission to take appropriate recuperation measures; in which on November of that year, the Xianzhou Yaoqing moored in the Sakin Chadu star system in Kersarran star cluster and cooperated with the Interastral Peace Corporation to harness local minerals and recuperate. On December of that year, the Yaoqing secured another resounding victory against Asmodeus' abominations."}

History. During the Lone Voyage Era when the Xianzhou fleet was still wandering around. The population of the Xianzhou Yuanqiao and Xianzhou Daiyu once declined drastically due to the corrosion of viscorpuses. At the end of the year of 2609 Star Calendar, the Yuanqiao, along with the Yuque, Cangcheng, Xuling, all introduce their own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. On February, Year 3198 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou fleet was embroiled in chaos due to coarse revolts on several ships. The coarse master messaged each ship and they launched an assault on the Xianzhou Zhuming. On the Year 3287 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Yuanqiao lost control during the Civil War, plunging into a red giant and disappearing completely. With both sides in bereavement, a ceasefire is reached. This event became known as the \"Living Catastrophe\" of the Three Sufferings Era. The Yuanqiao engulfed in riot and plunging into the red giant is a type of woe fortuned that can be divined by Ruoyue. The receiver of this omen would currently be in thick darkness devoid of light. The bearer of this sign is supposedly a busybody who always gets themselves into strife. There is no turning back, and separation is inevitable. They should understand that it is common for people to abandon others just to find a way to keep themselves alive in the face of disaster, and that they shouldn't dwell too much on their past."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=13175","text":"The Xianzhou Yuque is one of the Flagships of the Hexafleet owned by the Xianzhou Alliance. It is headed by the \"Seer Strategist\", the Arbiter-General Yaoguang. The Yuque's specialty export is jade abaci, as the lithogenic ore of the Fallow Earth on the Yuque is the source of the Xianzhou's Jade Abacus technology. Overview. The Yuque was the birthplace of the Divination Commission, where the stargazers and diviners gathered to observe the stars and plot the path ahead for the Alliance. As such, they use powerful devices such as the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier Matrix to draw information from the past and predict the future by interpreting hexagrams, and the Cloudpeer Telescope, the ultimate astronomical observation device in the Alliance that can detect traces and signals of the Reignbow Arbiter's Lux Arrow and manifestations. Not only can it scry into the distance, it can also be used to send out information. The stargazers steer the Cloudpeer Telescope and peer into the depths of the stars. In the midst of the gloom, the spinning jade abacus emanates a radiance, guiding the ship to its bright destination. Per the Surveillance Report sent to the Seat of Divine Foresight in the Luofu, the Yuque is currently located around the Giant's Arm star cluster. History. At the end of the Year 2609 Star Calendar in the Theophany Era, the Xianzhou Yuque, along with the Yuanqiao, Cangcheng, and Xuling all introduced their own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. On May, Year 3061 Star Calendar, the coarse rioted on the Xianzhou Yuque but was suppressed by nobility. Subsequent rebellions occurred on April and July the following year, 3062 Star Calendar. Both were suppressed by the nobles. During the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree called Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars. As if attracted by the power of the Ambrosial Arbor on the Luofu, Muldrasil began to approach it, and war broke out between the Xianzhou and the Denizens of Abundance residing in the tree. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation were released to counter the invasion \u2014 including the Reignbow, who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu, which was the third-furthest away in the battle formation. The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, severing the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil. Around 5,000 years ago, the Wisdom Sapientia Academe was formed on the Yuque, providing a constant supply of talented technicians who believed in the Wisdomwalker to various Xianzhou commissions. Not a single Xianzhou person who believed in the Reignbow Arbiter had any issues with the arrangement. Many intellectuals abandoned their old paths for good and chose to follow the Wisdomwalker on the Path of Erudition. They were called the Wisdom Sect. Most Wisdom Sect members preferred to focus on academic research in their ivory towers, rather than spending time on secular matters. Hence, their presence was not felt much during the Crisis of Belief era. The Wisdom Sect still exists today, although it is hardly known and only has a small group of followers left. In The Year 4800 of the Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing: \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Mons Grandis was bound to watch over the Fallow Earth on the Yuque. Stargazers of the Yuque once produced 152 consecutive years' worth of observational records about the dead planet Syracuse-III and watched as the Antimatter Legion crept very slowly toward this front line, building up an advantage, exerting pressure, and chipping away at any resistance. They speculated that behind the scenes lay an Overlord with a calm and self-sufficient temperament. Based on IPC records, at least 122 planets were plunged into chaos of unknown origin over the past 600 years before their ultimate demise at the hands of the Antimatter Legion. The Yuque's Divination Commission attributed these series of events to another unseen Lord Ravager. The Yuque's Divination Commission observed the destruction of Muldrasil around the year 5320 Star Calendar. The Antimatter Legion destroyed the wingweavers' home almost instantly. According to the speculations of the Yuque's Divination Commission, there may be other worlds like Muldrasil. During the resistance of the alliance against the Abominations of Abundance, the Intelligentsia Guild once dispatched a troop consisting of the Learned to join the 2nd of the Abundance Wars in Year 5749 Star Calendar. The troop helped in defeating Shuhu, an Abundance Emanator that besieged the Yuque. At some point in history, the Xianzhou Yuque was rescued by the High-Cloud Quintet. During an unnamed conflict on Thalassa, the Yuque's Nephjade Orbit Fleet laid out a defense in coordination with the Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, determined the outcome of the battle and relayed it to the Arbiter-Generals, who in turn deployed Crane Feather Orbit Fleet of the Yaoqing instead of the Fanghu. Though the Fanghu's Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet could have stopped the abominations with their Vidyadhara cloudhymn magi, they were too far away, and current forces on the battlefield would have had to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before Fanghu reinforcements arrived. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa. In the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Xianzhou Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of the living planet Ketu Mirage, and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight, but they were still in a dire situation. Diviner Fu Xuan of the Luofu proposed a plan to the Six Charioteers to contact the Reignbow Arbiter using the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, which would be shipped to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, was the only person who has the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope and could send out a signal in the format of the Reignbow's decree. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. Master Diviner Jingtian perished in the collateral destruction. On July, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Yuque reported continuing their explorations along an ancient shipping lane. Sometime in the present, the Xianzhou Yuque was trekking around the periphery of the Giant's Arm star cluster, plotting an ancient course as it continued its explorations. The ship's Cloudpeer Telescope captured signals from Reignbow's Lux Arrow traversing through three of its coordinates. The master diviner interpreted this as a divine mandate, and the Marshal issued orders for the Xianzhou Yaoqing Cloud Knights' Crane Feather Orbit Fleet and Red Song Orbit Fleet to both set out on patrol as hereby informed. In their recent observations, the Yuque Divination Commission reported that the Brood Lord Angqin lead his hunting pack against the Shepherds fleet near the Echidna skywall in an internal war between the Borisins. They also learned from the IPC's data that the wingweavers' Peacock Angel legion had arrived at the Consternation Starzone to locate a Stellaron and revive their homeworld of Muldrasil. They also observed that the Baranza Forge, an industrial planet along the Luofu's route, had been completely neutralized by the Lord Ravager Irontomb's assault, deeming it a medium-low threat to the Luofu and advised the Divination Commission to monitor electrical signals from Irontomb's vehicle. At one point, the Yuque was searching for the leader of the Galaxy Rangers, La Mancha, hoping to rebuild a connection with the hero. It is unknown if they are still pursuing this endeavor. After the Stellaron Crisis on the Xianzhou Luofu around the Year 8100 Star Calendar, Jingliu and Luocha were to be sent to the Xianzhou Xuling to be held for a joint trial before the Ten-Lords Commission and the Seven Arbiter-Generals according to protocol. However, after General Jing Yuan reported the events to Marshal Hua, General Yaoguang took an interest in their case, and had the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier set up, detouring the two to the Yuque."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=13173","text":"The Xianzhou Zhuming is one of the six Flagships owned by the Hexafleet of the Xianzhou Alliance. It is headed by the \"Flaming Heart\", the Arbiter-General Huaiyan, Master of the Artisanship Commission. The Zhuming's specialty export is porcelain. While the Heliobi were wiped out toward the end of the Flaming Catastrophe, a small number of them could still be found on the Zhuming. According to Qingzu, Zhuming residents love to play with fire. Overview. The Zhuming is described to look different than a typical Xianzhou ship, like an intricately-carved golden lotus, gradually unfolding it's lustrous leaves around the cone-headed central hull, peaceful and tranquil. It was said that the craftsmen here were liberal in form and definition and that the residents have completely transformed the ship beyond recognition since their departure several millennia ago. Xianzhou artifex technology is on the bleeding edge, with the Zhuming being among the most advanced of all. Just as Elixir Seekers rush to the Luofu in a neverending stream, so too is the Zhuming up there with Pier Point and Planet Screwllum for craft apprentices. Countless Outworlders come to the Zhuming from all over the cosmos to study skills, and most return to their homelands afterward to disseminate those learnings, and countless craftsmen are busy melting metals and forging their masterpieces. The ship's blast furnaces are smoldering with flames, and various ingenia are constantly being transported on its deck. Some sixty or seventy percent of all the Xianzhou's armory comes from the artisans of the Zhuming and they don't lack for arms. As such, General Huaiyan was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives to reinforce the Yaoqing's Crane Feather Orbit fleet, but only a dozen or so personnel. They are known for their use of artillery in combat. According to Hanya, the Zhuming is under the influence of the Reignbow Arbiter, and the people there are able to coexist with the heliobi while being free from their manipulation. Zhuming flower-drum opera is a type of performance art. Areas. Flamedisk Forge Palace. The Flamedisk Forge Palace is the foundational base of the Zhuming's Artisanship Commission. An unknown emperor of the Primeval Imperium was said to have once gifted the master craftsman of the Zhuming, Yang Di, with a weapons-casting mold in honor of its maiden voyage. To this day it remains, passed down through the ages to be the pride of place in the palace. \"Smelt for a thousand stars; quicken with steel of heroes. The forge's light boosts power and might; and armaments guard both hearth and meal.\" These verses hang in adornment in the main hall of the Flamedisk Forge Palace. Inside the palace also contains the Flint Emperor, also known as the Primordial Flame or Psuedo Sun. It is said that it is a living flame that slumbers in the engine of the Zhuming. It is a creature the Xianzhou regarded as a great enemy in the old days, also called the Primordial Flame. The craftsmen of the Zhuming used every means available to imprison it in the furnace and used its power to forge various divine weapons. Firmamend Temple. The Firmamend Temple was built by the IPC on the Zhuming during the Crisis of Belief, a 600 year time period between the Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar where Qlipoth was once the pillar of the Xianzhou Alliance's beliefs. The temple is now an affiliated academy of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission. Achievements in Alchemy is an alchemy textbook used in the academy. The book compiled by the Zhuming Alchemy Commission is a comprehensive summary of alchemical prescriptions and their smelting and refinement techniques. Alchemy Commission. The Zhuming's Alchemy Commission compiled the book Achievements in Alchemy, a comprehensive summary of alchemical prescriptions and their smelting and refinement techniques. The book is used as a textbook in the academy. Radiant Zenith. The vast starskiff platform was described as seemingly chiseled out of a single block of moonstone so big that it disappears over the horizon with a comfortable, soothing honey-yellow color and the seamless integration of the structure's frame into the port \u2014 as if it's an array of metals sprouting from the minerals below. It is described as a proud and blatant display of craftsmanship sulpted deliberately to debunk any biased ideas Outworlders might have formed before they arrived on the Zhuming. Dragon Palace's Kitchen. The Zhuming is also home to the Dragon Palace's Kitchen, the only Interastral Gourmet Association-rated five star restaurant among all the Xianzhou ships. History. During the Heliobi Wars, the Heliobi form a red micro-star in an attempt to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad, led by the Reignbow, disassemble and weaponize the ship's auxiliary engines to fight the Heliobi. The Xianzhou's suicide squad send the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star formed by the Heliobi, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. The defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, is imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life. In the Theophany Era, on December, Year 2607 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Zhuming, alongside the Yaoqing and Fanghu, introduced it's own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. On February, Year 3198 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou fleet was embroiled in chaos due to coarse revolts on several ships. The coarse master messaged each ship and they launched an assault on the Xianzhou Zhuming, holing up in a delve with an expeditionary force to fight against the nobles. Both sides eventually reached a ceasefire and join forces to defeat the rebelling aurumatons, dispatching envoys to negotiate peace with each other. A peace agreement is reached and military affairs are curtailed. Troops are reorganized to defeat the aurumatons, putting an end to the aurumaton rebellion. During the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium \u2014 Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war breaks out as a result. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation are released to counter the invasion \u2014 including the Reignbow. The Reignbow heads into the prison deep within the Xianzhou Zhuming to persuade the imprisoned Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, to help the Xianzhou fight off the Denizens of Abundance. They make a deal, allowing the Flint Emperor to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu. After the battle, the Reignbow disappears. Between the Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar during the Crisis of Belief, the IPC built the Firmamend Temple on the Zhuming. In The Year 4800 of the Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Ardens Regia was bound to watch over the Primordial Flame on the Zhuming. At some point in history, the Zhuming, alongside the Yaoqing and Fanghu, engaged in warfare against Lord Ravager Celenova and her troops. In the Year 5700 Star Calendar, Lord Ravager and Overlord Celenova boards a Xianzhou Ship and requests a ceasefire with the Xianzhou Zhuming, requesting the ship to change course and assist in attacking the homeworld of the wingweavers. In the year 7032, 23-year-old Izumitamagawa arrived at the Xianzhou Zhuming as a trade specialist, and resided there as a visitor for the rest of her life. She realized that the Galaxy's knowledge of the Xianzhou Alliance at the time was mostly based on incomplete stories or unfounded rumors. Therefore, she resolved to author an epic work that would comprehensively present the Xianzhou civilization to foreigners. That was how, forty years later, the \"Grand Encyclopedia of Xianzhou\" was born. Once, a delegation containing Baiheng and a dozen others were sent to request for arms and reinforcements from the Zhuming for the Yaoqing's Crane Feather Orbit Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the Borisin. They were recieved by General Huaiyan's apprentice, Yingxing, at Radiant Zenith and escorted through by the Flamedisk Forge Palace, where they observed the Flint Emperor's light being sealed. There, they met with Huaiyan, who was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Helm-Master Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel. Sometime in the past, Ardens Regia, the high elder of the Xianzhou Zhuming, sent a Vidyadhara craftsman to the Luofu to teach the masters of the Luofu Artisanship Commission about craftsmanship. The craftsman then started their hatching rebirth with the intent to pass back their improved knowledge back to the Zhuming after their rebirth. On November, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Zhuming reported that it was moored in the Le Roy Ladurie cluster's Stella Yamazaki star system, inside the territory of the Klimt Republic. The Zhuming is set to remain there for 10 Star Calendar years to conduct scientific exchanges. They hoped to deploy advanced forging technology in exchange for some of the rich local mineral deposits."}

Why do we still have old geezer traditionalists like you? \"All who arrive from the endless starry seas are our guests\" \u2014 didn't the teachers in the lyceum teach you this? @StarwatcherStation_StartledDeer Can the mod of the day please delete this post!? Let the Trials Come \"Posted on: September 29\" Woe is me, for the Xianzhou art of tea has perished! In days of yore 'twas a balance of various scents distilled, a frugality of practicality and simplicity combined, a world order of filial respect and table side manners observed, and a modest joy of sipping tea as life's meaning is revealed. Now, cast your gaze upon Luofu, and despair at how all had dissipated! No billows of clouds, no tumbling of creeks, the heavens have forsaken us, and the noble houses are lost. All are now interchanged with works of blunt metal, O the very ugliness of it! Be it so that the tea sets have retired, and that the art of tea is lost to this world. Yet, how unsightly that we now drink tea by the roadside, and sip its aromas as we carelessly walk! Xianzhou had constructed the interconnected web through thousands of dimensions so friends from all corners of the universe could converse, yet now we misconstrue words and spread wide slander and false discourse! 'Tis a time when the very foundations of Xianzhou are in danger! Mapo tofu with bownana \"Posted on: October 2\" Woah, a real Luofu resident is here! Everyone, scamper! Actually, are they in the wrong section of the station? Lol A portrait burning at Starwatcher \"Replied to: Let the Trials Come, October 7\" What you say is correct, however the Xianzhou is nowhere near as unsightly as you make it out to be. I am but a humble citizen who has worked for some time in Luofu's tea industry, and it is my opinion that the new metallic tea machines have lowered the threshold for people who want to try out tea. Classic methods such as \"Vegetations in the Alchemy Cauldron\" need so much time and equipment, therefore less and less people were drinking tea that way. I think it's a good thing that more Outworlders can now experience the essence and uniqueness of Xianzhou's art of tea. Mapo tofu with bownana \"Posted on: October 10\" Here's an honest fellow! Everyone, get out of here!"}

In Year 8072 Star Calendar, the Yaoqing and the Fanghu sent warning signals about the assembly of a Denizens of Abundance army, the revival of the roaming star Ketu Mirage, and an attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight: the Rainbow Orbit Fleet, Thunderclap Orbit Fleet, Caladrius Orbit Fleet, and Comet Orbit Fleet. Diviner Fu Xuan's divinations predicted that the Xianzhou would lose if they went against the enemy forces head on but would have a chance to turn the tide if they fought defensively. The Arbiter-Generals chose not to heed her advice due to the overwhelming numbers of the Abundance forces.

Note: Currently using \"Before Trailblazer Awakening (BTA)\" as the main universal unit of time measurement before the Present as the in-game Eras are not yet clear (Amber Eras vs Trailblaze Years). The Astral Express uses the Trailblaze Calendar, said to originate from the home planet of Akivili, the Aeon of Trailblaze \u2014 the isolated world of Pegana. This calendar system divides each year into twelve months of varying lengths. It is still used on many planets that Akivili once passed during their travels. No dates are currently recorded in the Trailblaze Calendar. The calendar commonly used in the cosmos, created and promoted by the Interastral Peace Corporation, is the Amber Era. It starts at the estimated birth of Qlipoth, known as the Aeon of Preservation, and initiates a new Era every time Qlipoth swings their hammer during construction. Since Qlipoth swings their hammer at unpredictable intervals, the duration of each Amber Era varies significantly, ranging anywhere from 76 to 240 Trailblaze Years when converted. Jarilo-VI primarily uses the After-Fortification Calendar, established by Supreme Guardian Alexandra Rand, labeling or numbering years with Before-Fortification (BF) and After-Fortification (AF). The year of the Eternal Freeze and the completion of Belobog are referred to as the Fortification. This calendar uses 12 standardized months, similar to the Trailblaze Calendar. The Xianzhou Alliance primarily uses the Star Calendar to keep time, which is similar to the Trailblaze Calendar in that it divides the year into 12 standardized months. However, readable material that states the month and day rarely notes the Star Calendar Year, and vice versa. The day of departure is deemed the beginning of the Star Calendar. &gt;1000 Amber Eras Before the Trailblazer's Awakening. Primeval Imperium Era.

She was a princess of the Pupsha Empire when her brother, the Emperor, had been assassinated in a coup orchestrated by her second sister who wasn't her mother's biological daughter. Thanks to her Gray Knight, she escaped to Kincharitgates State - the Empress Dowager's fiefdom. Later, the Empress Dowager rallied her army and overthrew her second sister's short-lived imperial rule. Tizocic II ascended the throne and became the Pupsha Empire's Emperor. In order to protect her daughter, the Empress Dowager began ruling in her stead. When she was of age, the Empress Dowager passed away, and her extended family did not intend to return her imperial authority. During a trial, Tizocic II accused her uncle, General Daquette, for the death of 49 family's member of Tax Collector Turian. He tried to attempt to her life but was killed. Then, she summoned the real culprit Lenamar to whom she promised to be the Empire's Spymaster, and killed her with poisoned wine. In the next few months, she used the tax collector extermination as an excuse to eradicate the Empress Dowager's clansmen. But she felt as if she had to kill more and more people who opposed her rule. She chose to kill a captured rebel and his family because she believed they will hate her and attempt another coup. She chose to kill her chief because she believed he tried to poison her by eating the ice cream before the roasted chicken. She ordered a minister to execute a saturation bombing on Pasdrak City where four million citizens lived because three rebellions have occurred in that city within five years. He refused and was thrown along with the bombs. She decided to kill a minister who tried to provide relief to disaster victims because it wasn't fair for the rest of the refugees. At the end of her rule, her retainers killed the Gray Knight for freeing traitors. When the revolutionaries barged into the palace, she had already fled to Penacony. She asked The Family to seal her past memories, for they brought her nothing but fear. Present. In Penacony, she takes the appearance of a Halovian and proclaims herself as an \"emperor.\" She has become a benevolent person and often helps others in Penacony. Back to her real self thanks to the Trailblazer, she is willing to be taken back to Pupsha to stand trial by Swanga, Executive Leader of the Old Empire Dissolution Committee of the Pupsha Republic and his Vice-Leader, Illifan. She has been charged with over 70 war crimes, 13.12 million murders etc. Her \"emperor\" role is succeeded by an Intellitron known as Tizocic III, who voluntarily continues her benevolent career. Tizocic III uses \"the late\" to refer to Tizocic II, which implies the latter was executed for her crimes."}

To the researcher of the \"Unbearable Weight\" Curio, I heard you are the expert on galactic biodiversity, so I would like to present to you a few questions I have been asking myself, I hope your answers will bring some enlightenment to my path. Before this, I have \u2014 through various formal and informal meetings, spiritually infused and regular fiber paper letters \u2014 participated in passionate debates on whether Tottonid are silicon-based lifeforms or just rocks. However, there are still questions that beg to be answered. As we know, the discipline in which you operate has defined Tottonids as \"silicon-based lifeforms that communicate with internal electrical signals.\" However, they have already become extinct through the long Amber Eras, leaving behind only a crown encrusted with a thought monotectic of past monarchs \u2014 the Curio \"Unbearable Weight.\" Excuse my ignorance, but I have a few questions: 1. Since Tottonids allegedly communicate with electrical signals, no one in this galaxy would be able to decipher their thoughts, language, or history. So then, you can claim that said electrical signal exists, but I can also claim that said signal does not exist. How can we determine its falsifiability? 2. Since it is not falsifiable, maybe the racial history of the Tottonids was just a fabrication of the History Fictionologists since the beginning. 3. In this space station, aside from specific individuals, most researchers don't usually step out of the comfort of their labs, and therefore there had been no one who traveled to Planet Totton to verify and study this claim. Simply obtaining a crystal crown and a grand history that is, again, unverifiable had determined that the Tottonids are lifeforms with a long cultural history. Isn't this going against the criteria of research? 4. In the interdisciplinary summit in the space station, the Department of Galactic Geography listed the mineral composition of the Unbearable Weight in a detailed report and defined it as a rare mineral cluster. However, the Department of Ecology named it a thought monotectic construct of an extinct race and claimed the Curio as their own. This, in my humble opinion, is no different than that of a pirate. After much thought and many restless nights, I have decided that I could not bear the thought of your good name being sullied due to misguided Curio categorization. I also could not bear the thought of my discipline, the Department of Ecology, being stampeded under the strong-arming ways of a certain department.

Text. Time: August 35, 13:00: to 16:00 Interrogator: Spiritfarer Shouling of the Ten-Lords Commission Culprit: Xili Gender: Female Race: Wingweaver Age: Unknown Shouling: You have committed terrible deeds, but perhaps it is because you were raised in a dreadful environment and taught the wrong values. This led you astray. Shouling: Listen, if you're willing to cooperate, the Alliance may not necessarily condemn you and your partners to death. Would someone as proud as you be willing to work with us? Xili: Oh, so you're saying you won't kill us?... Hah, yeah. You know, I'm actually curious about how we've even managed to survive this long. Shouling: Well, a group of Armed Archaeologists approached you with an impact drum for sale, and naturally, you were interested in such a good toy. The deal was going smoothly... until a gang of borisins showed up with a higher bid. Shouling: Naturally, you raised your offer as well. I mean, that drum was a true treasure. It could wipe out all organic life on a ship without causing any other damage to the valuables. If I were a bandit like you, I'd want it too. Xili: What are you even trying to say? There's no way those mad dogs came to you and complained about us! Shouling: Hey, be patient... I'm just trying to explain what exactly happened. After those borisins increased their offer to outrageous levels far beyond the market value, you took it as an insult. Shouling: But you're not some savage brute... right? So, you tried to reason with the gang and figure out what these \"mad dogs\" wanted, but to your surprise... They attacked you instead. Xili: Heh... I see, that's why it happened. I was wondering why Rangan suddenly attacked me. He's not some lunatic... So that's how it is! You're pretty smart. Xili: I've heard rumors for a while that you had agents among the borisins... How did you manage that? Did you convert some of them? Or did you find some Zhuming Foxians who look like borisins? Ouch... what's this?! Shouling: Oops, it appears you've just triggered the restraints on your bindings. Sorry for not reminding you earlier, but you're not in a position to ask questions. Xili: Tsk... You worthless maggot crawling in dirt! Shouling: So... let's get to the point. Presently, all the Denizens of Abundance believe that wingweaver Xili's clan was involved in a conflict with Ragan the borisin's hunting party, and Rangan attacked Xili's fleet, leaving the fate of its leader unknown. Xili: So, you want me to seek revenge on Rangan and provoke a feud between borisin and wingweavers? If that's what you want, you don't have to arrest me, because I will exact my own retribution. Shouling: No, you won't, because you're not one of the Sky-Defenders. You're a Hymn-Singer. You're smarter and more patient than those military nobles, and you're not the type to seek \"revenge\" over a mere insult. Shouling: Furthermore, the greatest difference between you and the others is that you are not one of the Sky-Defenders who share power among them, and you can never join them... Therefore, you don't care about the wingweavers' military coalition. All you care about is your own clan. Am I right? Shouling: And that's why we have apprehended you and all your people. Xili: (Remains silent for a while) Xili: Can I ask a few questions? Shouling: Of course. Xili: If I go attack them, can you guarantee... that I'll make it out alive? Shouling: No, I can't guarantee that. Xili: But what about my clansmen? Shouling: The Alliance will grant them pardons for their crimes. They will be protected fairly in the name of Reignbow, but they will not be allowed to proliferate. Does that sound fair? Xili: Well, fair enough. Shouling: Deal? Xili: ...Deal."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5732","text":"Travelogue on Xianzhou Travelogue on Xianzhou is a readable from the Xianzhou Luofu. Text. Delves. I remember being in awe of the Xianzhou Luofu's enormity when I first saw it years ago. The starship that we were on inched closer and closer to the \"flagship,\" until the Xianzhou's outline became visible to us passengers. That was when I heard people gasping in awe behind me. Some of them even started cheering softly. The ship was so majestic in its enormity that it projected an aesthetic aura that was strange and yet splendorous. As seasoned a traveler as I was, I found myself helplessly enamored by the sense of wonder the Xianzhou had left on me. But just before arriving at the port, I made a startling discovery. The Xianzhou flagship might be a bit too tiny to house any civilization of note. Throughout the vast expanse of the galaxy, there exist innumerable civilizations entirely established on artificial entities. A massive building complex formed by linking an entire star system together, a sea of artificial planets that seem to have no boundaries, a ring-shaped metropolis built around a black hole... No matter what the specific case it might be, maintaining a habitat and ecosystem \u2014 which are prerequisites for supporting any living organism \u2014 requires a genuinely enormous infrastructure to be built. Compared with these gargantuan creations that could easily span entire galaxies, the Xianzhou flagship is simply too tiny. Some historical records from the Intelligentsia Guild have vaguely stated how the Xianzhou ship was once part of a fleet of vessels that were sent to visit Aeons. But even going by the number of all the currently remaining ships, six such Xianzhou ships would still be far from enough to provide the necessary space for any powerful interstellar civilization to survive. However, when we finally moved into the port, went through all those labyrinthine boarding procedures with the Sky-Faring Commission, and eventually set foot on the Xianzhou Luofu, all preconceived doubts about the viability of the Xianzhou ship suddenly became comically unwarranted. When I got to the bustling skyport that is the Luofu's Starskiff Haven, I started to question if my spatial sense had gone completely haywire. Without a doubt, all this visible space in Starskiff Haven is enough to fill up the entire Luofu. Strange planets were hanging up high in the sky. Everything looked completely different from the view on the outside. What kind of sorcery was this? An Amicassador from the Sky-Faring Commission welcomed me with a professionally-trained smile and told me that many outworlders were just as amazed on their visit. The marvel I had just witnessed was simply referred to as \"delve\" by the locals on the Xianzhou. In the weeks that followed, I visited several other delves on the Xianzhou ship, or should I say, the cabins of the Xianzhou. These delves all varied in size and shape, but they were all on a scale that was just too large for any normal ship to contain. Some of these delves could hold up entire commercial districts, such as Exalting Sanctum, while others could even contain vast luxuriant prairies like the Ever-Hunt Plains. By simple logic, I knew these people here would never disclose to me the exact principles at work in these delves. If this wasn't just a visual facade, then it probably was some kind of mind-blowing space-folding technology. \"Delve.\" Hmph. They just called it a different name to make it sound more exotic. Space folding is hardly anything new. On a large scale, it can be used for space travel, and when done on a smaller scale, it can be used as a means of storage. Many civilizations have developed their own methods of space folding. But it is still very rare to see such ubiquitous usage of space-folding technology on a scale so large that it has become a cornerstone of Xianzhou's daily life. The reason why this is particularly difficult to accomplish is surprisingly simple. The level of energy required to fold space grows in proportion to the volume of the space being folded. For most civilizations, the cost of pulling this off would just be too astronomical. But the people of Xianzhou have achieved this so effortlessly, the power behind which must have something to do with the Aeons. By Nous, if given a chance to further examine this closely, I would perhaps be able to comprehend how Xianzhou managed to create such unusual dimensions. My discovery would definitely bring enormous economic benefits for the Intelligentsia Guild. Starskiff. Speaking of the first impressions of the Xianzhou Luofu, many people would first think of the starskiffs that flow endlessly at the Jade Gate like a huge school of fish or a flock of birds. Nah, an endless stream of flying vessels is nothing unusual. I've once witnessed the traffic jams of spaceships at Tannhauser's portal and the flying taxicabs in Punklorde. But it was still quite a culture shock to witness these elegant skiffs gliding past the jade-green eaves. In the Xianzhou language, they refer to any vehicle that can fly as a \"starskiff,\" much like how we call them \"spaceships.\" However, based on the research I have conducted thus far, the term \"starskiff\" also has a more limited use case, where it specifically refers to those small passenger aircraft that have a streamlined design with a pointy end and are only for civilian usage within the Xianzhou's delves. In the standardized months since I arrived at Xianzhou, these starskiffs have shuttled me around to different delves. The Amicassador accompanying me was a beautiful Foxian girl (God knows, she might even be older than my grandmother). Then, she gave me an encouraging smile and asked if I wanted to try my hand at piloting a starskiff. \"It's fairly simple, really. Here on the Luofu, it's natural for any young person around the age of 40 to know how to pilot one.\" I rubbed my bald head and simply smiled back as I turned down her offer. In my free time, I got to closely examine the design of these starskiffs, and I found out that their sterns were all equipped with a type of basic anti-gravity device that had the appearance of a jade piece. (The Amicassador informed me this was known as a \"jade wheel.\") It was quite intriguing that I could not spot any visible traces of the ship being pieced together. From the bottom to the deck and to the bow, the entire body of the vessel seemed to come in just one single piece. This kind of manufacturing technology piqued my curiosity, but I didn't get an answer until I got an invitation to visit the Stargazer Navalia six months later. It was there that I got to see the starskiff assembly line. These ships weren't manufactured by some convoluted array of industrialized machinery. Rather, it was a series of petri dishes, or perhaps I should say they were more like pots for growing plants. These ships are made in a bionic assembly line that is more comparable to plant cultivation than it is to industrialized manufacturing. The ship's skeleton, hull, deck, and all other parts were all made from seeds grown in petri dishes, which were eventually made into a starskiff as one. In terms of the advancement of space flight technology, I'm of the opinion that Interastral Peace Corporation's vessels are not inferior to these. Nevertheless, I can also see why the IPC's ships aren't more common in Xianzhou, judging from the perspective of demand and production speed. Realm-Keeping Commission. Without a doubt, the Realm-Keeping Commission is the one department that outworlders get to interact with the most. Checking resident cards on the streets? That's the Realm-Keeping Commission's job. Doing surveys for census records? That's the Realm-Keeping Commission's job. What about maintaining order for major festivals and ceremonies, arresting thieves, and inspecting the ecosystem of the Ever-Hunt Plains? These are once again within the purview of the Realm-Keeping Commission. Finally, which department is in charge of issuing the updated star-time standard when the Xianzhou is passing through the strong gravitational pull of a celestial body? You guessed it, it's the Realm-Keeping Commission... Outworlders interact with the Realm-Keeping Commission so frequently that there was a time when I couldn't help but wonder if these notes about the commission were superfluous. Anyone who stayed on the Xianzhou long enough would naturally become familiar with the functions of the Realm-Keeping Commission. But when I sat down and examined the Realm-Keeping Commission in detail, I discovered that it turned out to be a highly unusual organization. If you were to flip through some of their publicly released official materials \u2014 such as \"A Collection of Interesting Outworlder Laws,\" which every outworlder would get upon arrival, and \"Protecting Starskiff Haven,\" the commission's self-celebratory propagandist documentary, which only went viral due to its absurdity \u2014 you might think, or rather the commission wants you to think, that they are just a typical law enforcement agency. However, when you take a closer look at what they actually do, you'll find that the scope of their work is mind-boggling. Public security, firefighting, population statistics, calendar system... Even a fully staffed government department would be hard-pressed to take on all these duties. Another thing that I found to be particularly unusual. The Realm-Keeping Commission is nominally in charge of handling misdemeanor cases in Xianzhou (felony cases seem to fall under the jurisdiction of the Ten-Lords Commission). But in the vast majority of misdemeanor cases, arrests are actually made by the Cloud Knights. Likewise, the Realm-Keeping Commission is the one department nominally responsible for releasing the calendar system, yet the data collection work is actually done by the Sky-Faring Commission and the data extrapolation is handled by the Divination Commission. Based on the documents that I've sourced, the Realm-Keeping Commission presents itself to the public as a body that does odd jobs and offers support for all other departments. To put it bluntly, it functions like a sewer into which all the work flows, always working hard so that everyone else on the Xianzhou may continue their peaceful way of life... Is that actually the case, though? Is there a group of individuals who are prepared to endure everything for the happiness of others? In my opinion, it can't possibly be this simple. Based on my basic understanding of how human society operates, I'm of the opinion that people have in fact misconstrued the relationship between the Realm-Keeping Commission and all other departments. The Realm-Keeping Commission must have been superior to all other departments, contrary to what most people would have you believe. Members of this commission can be found in every corner of society, from rundown ports to the ivory tower. They are the executive branch of the law, they are the hard-working scholars, and they are the scheming masterminds behind the scenes. On Xianzhou, no one can evade the watchful eye of the Realm-Keeping Commission as they are the officially licensed spies. We just can't spot them, even if they are standing right before us in plain sight. When I start to think about all this, I can't help but feel a chill running down my spine. Artisanship Commission. For outsiders, Xianzhou is a place filled with mysteries. And legendary tales about Xianzhou's manufacturing sector are quite widespread. But the reality is that the Artisanship Commission's industrial assembly line is no different from all those that can be found in any other civilization. The only parts that can be described as mysterious are how incredibly slow the Xianzhou people's metabolisms are and how unusually closed off the commission is with the outside world, thus making some of their customs quite antiquated. I remember how often I would be left scratching my head at the extreme oddities of Xianzhou customs when I first arrived. I think most outworlders who have lived on Xianzhou before know exactly what I mean. What bewildered us first were, without a doubt, those creations made by the Artisanship Commission. All I wanted was to buy a portable lighting device that could be used as one of my disaster response gadgets. I walked by all the shelves in the store and still couldn't find what I needed. Any kind of basic flashlight would have been fine. I just wanted a small device with a design that has basically remained the same from the ancient past to our modern age, a device that you can find anywhere and that can emit light in emergencies. I ultimately found the most \"normal\" flashlight on Xianzhou with the help of a store clerk. The Artisanship Commission created this flashlight device in the shape of a fish, with its belly done as an open framework that could emit light. This flashlight could also produce light of adjustable intensity and emit it from different directions. As I grabbed the handle located on the fish's back, questions swirled in my mind. People on Xianzhou seemingly believed that this was a \"normal\" device for providing illumination. But this product just seemed so intricate and sophisticated to me that I would even call it a work of art... of a flashlight. Not long after that purchase, I started to collect these \"normal\" devices that were manufactured by the Artisanship Commission. I would then send what I found to the Intelligentsia Guild for further research. Judging from the feedback I received in their reports, most of the scholars didn't quite understand this custom of making objects overly decorative. One report in particular left the strongest impression on me. The author wrote, \"The craftsmanship of this is excellent. It is difficult to imagine how they were able to make a moving module of this precision so small. What draws my attention the most is how this device does not require any internal power source. It merely requires wind power to come to life. However, one thing still remains puzzling to me. What is the purpose of this device? Maybe it has something to do with the bell on the beast's body?\" My poor colleague had been overwhelmed by the lavishness of the Artisanship Commission's brilliant skills. In reality, the author of the report was not far off the mark. This \"miniature metallic beast\" was indeed meant to serve as a bell. The Xianzhou people use them as doorbells or hang them in their yards as decorative pieces. That's it. It is clear that the practice of adding ornamental features to ordinary objects (at times the decorative parts were made to a greater degree of precision than the object itself) stems from an antiquated Xianzhou tradition. To us, it seems like an eternity ago when they first left their home planet. But for them, it has been just a few generations ever since they gained immortality. So, even if these customs from the Old Era have long lost their practical meaning, they can still serve as shared memories, passed down for generations. The Artisanship Commission in particular values this tradition, which is apparent from their deep interest in a wide variety of ceremonies. A ceremony would be held for the first product manufactured on a new assembly line. A ceremony would also be held for the final product of an assembly line that is being put out of commission. There is a ceremony for newly opened shops and there is one for old workshops going out of business. The Artisanship Commission perhaps may not have faith in anything other than their own technology, but that does not damper their passion for holding ceremonies. The Artisanship Commission has a propensity to turn even the most minor objects into breathtakingly wonderful pieces of art. I am therefore convinced that it is necessary for us to research the Artisanship Commission's techniques further for potential long-term benefits. Jade Abacus. The jade abacus has seen wide usage among both the government and common folks in general. I once asked a diviner who used to work for the Divination Commission this question \u2014 \"What exactly is this Matrix of Prescience Ultima?\" \"It's nothing special, to be honest. Just countless jade abaci linked together to form a matrix.\" the former diviner replied. \"It's nothing special, to be honest.\" This sentence has a showiness that could be considered revolting by outworlders. But my time on the Xianzhou ship allowed me to know that this diviner is telling the truth. Looking at the jade pendants and bracelets the people of Xianzhou wear, I can tell that their gorgeous jade jewelry is just the civilian version of jade abaci. And based on my observations, these jade abaci that are in the form of jewelry have a powerful level of performance that is on par with any other commonly available personal computer. I am not an expert in computer science, and so I sent some jade abaci over to a colleague in the Intelligentsia Guild who specializes in that field. Later, they sent me a response, \"Todd, all I see are some pieces of jade. Where are those computers you were talking about?\" If I knew, then I wouldn't have needed to bother him. After doing some investigating, he finally unearthed the secret of the jade abacus. In principle, the jade abacus is a type of crystal computer. If you were to take apart a jade abacus and do a close inspection, you would find that there are lines similar to semiconductor chips. This kind of technique is known as \"carving\" in Xianzhou. Even though we found the lines carved into the jade contained executable programs, my colleague at the Intelligentsia Guild could not find any signals being transmitted. This is what he said: \"I have seen many liquid-based and even gas-based computers that simply lack the structure that computers are supposed to have. But they are capable of performing powerful computations at scale because liquids and gases have a relatively flexible molecular structure, meaning they can be translocated in any way by design. I haven't discovered any similar physical properties in the structure of this jade ore. It is as if this jade was just a dumb rock that has suddenly been transformed into something heavenly by the forces of nature.\" My colleague was more than eager to continue dissecting the jade's structure, but I had a new stroke of inspiration. Since we cannot find any components that are supplying computing power, then that must mean the jade abacus is incomplete. It needs other elements to become whole. With this revelation, I made a wild guess (I just realized that I love using the phrase \"wild guess\")... The jade abacus itself is a certain type of quantum communication component. There was a force that existed among the tens of millions of jade abaci throughout the Xianzhou Alliance. The question is, what is supplying the computing power to all these jade abaci with? Perhaps there are many people who don't know that mammalian brains are one of the universe's most perfect computers. Herta of the Genius Society has a powerful brain with computing abilities that are only limited by the blob of proteins between her ears. She can't advance beyond the constraints of her hardware. But if there were a way that millions of brains could be linked together to create a complex and refined communications network like a nervous system that stretched across space, it would allow the intelligence and knowledge of those millions of people to converge together like surging rivers rushing out to sea. These millions of minds linked together would not just mean millions of minds' worth of information stored on this neural network. It would also mean that there is computing power that is at a level equal to the combined power of all these brains. A thought that once was a ripple on a lake would now be an enormous wave, every single drop of which contains hundreds of millions of synapses, releasing electronic currents and transmitting information, observations, memories, calculations... Yes. I believe that Xianzhou utilizes jade abaci to directly link people together. They use this kind of method to observe all of Xianzhou and record every creation. They can even calculate every moment in history. Everything is clear to them. In other words, the jade abacus isn't a kind of crystal computer. Rather, it is a type of bio-quantum computer. After my Intelligentsia Guild colleague from the computer science field heard my conjecture, he burst into laughter, like I was some kind of brainless reptile. I just hope that he can ultimately unearth the secrets of this technology... If bio-quantum computers could be applied to the Intelligentsia Guild, then this massive academic association would become a single scholar whose wisdom would be worthy of an audience with the Erudition of the Aeons. The Intelligentsia Guild has always believed that \"All knowledge must flow like currency.\" This would be the most efficient way to make that happen. Long-life Species I. Cleo, I hope this letter finds you well. First and foremost, I hereby declare: I voluntarily relinquish any right to claim remuneration from Scholar Cleo regarding this article. Now, pretend this is a list complaining about all the setbacks of a foolish old coot like me. Before the trip, you kept asking me why I took on this Luofu mission at my age. Back then, I... I'm sorry, I don't remember what I told you at the time. But I know that I still owe you a sincere reply. I know that the academy sent us here to engage in the profitable exchange of information, not to hear us ceaselessly repeat in our reports about the beautiful sights aboard the Xianzhou. But regarding the key issue of longevity, I'm like my predecessors whose only success has been managing to take in those beautiful sights. It's been almost 12 standardized months since I came to the Luofu \u2014 so one year has passed according to the Xianzhou star calendar. I've partied at the Grand Fair in Starskiff Haven, despite the herniated disc in my back; I've drunk the cultural heritage phenomenon of mung bean soda, as recommended by amicassadors (and when I say cultural heritage, just imagine what a hundred-year fermentation process it is \u2014 it's nothing to the Xianzhou natives!); and I've been to the Alchemy Commission for their acupuncture therapy. I feel as though I'm years younger! Still good for another few whacks from the old lady's turner! After all of these meaningless activities, I should have, as my failed predecessor should have, posed this crucial question: \"How can I, with my osteoporosis, failing memory, skin sagged like an empty beanbag... How can I return to the days of my youth, and live out another thousand years of life \u2014 just like you folks here on Xianzhou do?\" I never asked it though, Cleo \u2014 I never said a word. And that's why I'm sitting here sipping tea and writing up all of these letters of repine. All the intelligent beings in the universe want the secret to everlasting youth. Whilst we overwhelm ourselves with the suffering of life, we search inside ourselves and say: When our chance comes, we must take it and extend our lifespans. Yet without the help of technology, most intelligent hominids naturally wither and fade within the span of a hundred years. Except for a few races \u2014 those human subspecies known as long-life species. Blessed by a whimsy Aeon (usually Yaoshi), the lives of some intelligent hominids cross that threshold set for them by death. They possess a long lifespan, and multiply in disastrous quantities. What's more worrying is their natural aggression in plundering resources from various homeworlds, sometimes completely converting entire ecosystems. You must be pretty familiar with these lifeforms: the Denizens of Abundance. These Denizens of Abundance have no small volume of literature researched about them by the Intelligentsia Guild (as far as I know, many are utterly inhumane, but of course, the Abundance don't listen to reason). The researchers have all reached the same conclusion: The life-extension protocols of the Denizens of Abundance are intrinsically connected to their genetic make-up \u2014 cannibalism, interspecies blood transfusions, a hive mentality, rejuvenation via hibernation or molting... Despite easy access to longevity, most of the Denizens of Abundance lose their minds as they warp into twisted beasts (even if those saber-toothed tigers have somehow had access to interstellar travel, they would have caused less panic than the Denizens of Abundance do). Even if the Guild uncovers their secrets, nobody could commercialize it \u2014 rich people will never stump up the cost of treatment for inhuman long-living! In the end, the Intelligentsia Guild turned their research toward a more civilized long-life species: The Xianzhou Alliance. They are mortal enemies locked in eternal combat against their fellow long-life species, the Denizens of Abundance. The Alliance seems rational, can we invest some money in learning the secret to long life from them? Hmph, resource exchange, political mediation, trade wars... They have exhausted all possible methods to achieve nothing but regular academic exchanges. The Guild still doesn't plan on giving up, and keeps sending a stream of silly, cursed fools like us aboard the Xianzhou. Academic exchanges? Please, we might as well have the word \"SPY\" carved onto our foreheads. Do you really think the Xianzhou people don't get what we're up to? Will they just spill the beans while out doing grocery? Is it possible the masters governing the schools are all in fact idiots? Cleo, I'm sorry about all this blathering. Maybe I'm the idiot here. I know it's an impossible task, but here I still am. Because I'm no longer the middle-aged guy who used to teach you back then \u2014 I'm old now, my joints all creak and crunch like there're spikes inside me, and I curse the universe every time I have to rise from my chair. $?%*&amp;! Why? Why \u2014 no matter how far our tech advances \u2014 there is still no cure for arthritis? I truly regret not taking up the company on their cyber-medical insurance policy. At the time, I was filled with hubris and thought that I'd never grow old. But I was wrong. Now I hope to see a breakthrough before I die. Your dearest teacher, Todd Riordan Long-Life Species, Part 2. Cleo, I hope this letter finds you well. First and foremost, I hereby declare: I voluntarily relinquish any right to claim remuneration from Scholar Cleo regarding this article. Recently, I finally got acquainted with a few employees of the Alchemy Commission (which cost a lot of money), hoping to get some knowledge from them that ordinary outworlders can't get. I have sweet talked them and poured who knows how many catties of Dragon Spring Brew into them, but I still couldn't get them to show me the medical books and pharmacopoeia that cannot be released to the public. In their words, \"This can cause you to losing your head.\" The good news is that they were finally impressed by my \"sincerity\" and were willing to share with me some medical reports that were of little value to them. These medical reports were about the natural death of Foxians. I have attached the original report to this letter, so please pick it up for yourself. In terms of coming to their end, the natural death of Foxians, like the ultimate end of all long-life species, is shrouded in a fog that is difficult to penetrate with superficial science and technology. During the vast majority of a Foxian's life, a large number of all-powerful stem cells are stored in numerous organs of their body. These all-powerful stem cells will continuously repair the physical body of Foxians, allowing aging and damage to be healed in a short period of time. Until a few years before their end of life, the number of these all-powerful stem cells gradually decreases, but still remains sufficient to maintain their ageless appearance. At the age of 250 to 450 years (Note: the median age is 307 years), these all-powerful stem cells come to a complete halt and lose their ability to divide freely. What ensues is a death that comes with multiple organ failure. The natural death comes quickly, with patients often dying within 3 to 4 days after the all-powerful stem cells have lost their ability to divide. The good thing is that most of them are prepared for the various age-related diseases that begin to develop in their organs, so it is typically not too late to prepare for the aftermath. Of course, neither the Alchemy Commission nor I could figure out what factor prompts these all-powerful stem cells to suddenly fail at some point in time. Over twenty years ago, when the Intelligentsia Guild fought the borisin, we did some related experiments. I don't know if you remember... Oh, you shouldn't remember, you weren't even that old then. At that time, we removed the livers of some of the borisin and found that they turned into a huge, aggressive \"cancerous mass\" within a few hours. Considering the phylogenetic relationship between the borisin and Foxians, I think the principles involved are probably similar. There is something else that is unexplainable: There have been many case studies where the entire liver of a Foxian patient is completely removed, but there has never been a record of a Foxian turning into a \"cancerous mass.\" In fact, most Foxians grow a new liver after such a procedure and are discharged from the hospital with a normal recovery. (Although the records do show that losing a liver results in a much slower to regenerate compared to the loss of other organs.) I currently believe there are two explanations for this: 1. Foxian all-powerful stem cells aren't generated at the liver, but just gather there for some reason. (Which explains why the regeneration rate becomes slower after losing the entire liver.) 2. Foxians have some kind of biological difference with the borisin, and this subtle but huge difference determines the difference between the Xianzhou natives and Abominations of Abundance. Obviously, the incomplete \"immortality\" of Foxians is not accessible to us. But I find that there is still a considerable degree of commercial value in it \u2014 while these all-powerful stem cells aren't actually \"all-powerful,\" they can still enable Foxians to maintain their youthful appearance until their demise. Cleo, before I set out, you said to me, \"Teacher Riordan, I do not want to live forever. In living so long, even the more interesting things in life become meaningless. But I'm afraid of getting old, aging is terrifying.\" I didn't pay much heed to you at the time (and probably was even a little cold to you), but now I have to say that you were probably right. Most of the potential customers we can find in the galaxy probably hold the same thoughts as you do. They don't necessarily intend to live as long as the universe itself, but they merely wish to preserve their youth (or beauty) in the fleeting time that they have. If you're not busy these days, do some market research for me. Maybe the Foxian all-powerful stem cells will allow us to make a lot of money from \"eternal youth.\" If I die without achieving this, then the patent is all yours. Your dearest teacher, Todd Riordan"}

How are you faring? The heating system seems to be in a bit of a problem lately. Not only the Overworld, I heard even the Underworld was a little cold at night. Please take care of your body and don't catch a cold! I'm writing this letter to tell you that my listed Overworld residence will be off the market soon. Also, I've settled the new shopfront in Rivet Town. I should be able to reopen the shop in two months when I return. I did a little bit of math and subtracted the money I needed to buy the shopfront from the money I got from selling the house, as well as the debt I still owe, I still have around 800,000 credits to spare. Looks like I did make some money this trip to the Overworld. When I left for the Overworld, even selling everything I owned would've only amounted to 500,000. Goodness me, the properties in the Overworld have been rising without fail \u2014 even if I sold my current residence and bought a new one, the money I got from selling the house would just be enough for the down payment, that's pretty much the same as when I arrived at the Overworld. In those days I had to scrap for pennies, only eating even half a Belobog Sausage when I had some extra money, and had to resort to drinking snow water to stave off the hunger. I really don't want to live that life anymore. Side note, I really don't want to have any Belobog Sausage for the rest of my life, no matter what flavor it is. I originally wanted to approach my real estate agent and haggle more, but forget it, I'll just start a clean slate. After all, the Overworld life can eat you alive, I really don't want to stay there a minute longer. Especially that Bank of Belobog, they're so ridiculous! It's only, what, a few days late, it's not like I wasn't going to pay the debt! When I took out the loan, they were all so amiable, but when it was time to collect the debt, they were almost going to swallow me alive! Rivet Town is still the best with all our neighborly sensibilities. Talking about this stuff makes my blood boil. I'll stop going on about it, I'm heading home soon anyway. I plan to do what I used to do and open up a tiny daily sundry shop. I won't earn as much, but a simple life has its charms. Unlike being in the Overworld where work-life balance is barely a thought in mind. Look at me, talking about the Overworld again. Never mind that though, I finally got through the hardest part of it. Don't worry about me, Mom. I'll send you another letter when I'm done with everything here. Wishing you health and joy! Your Dearest Son, Robert Modric "}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3694","text":"Speed Speed, often abbreviated as SPD, is one of the stats in ', used by both characters and enemies. In combat, it determines Action Value (AV), and consequently the order and frequency in which characters and enemies will act. Action Value can be set to visible in the Other Settings tab of the Settings menu. formula_1 Base Action Value is the time between turns for each unit and is calculated based on their SPD: formula_2 Turn order is determined as follows: Over a long time, the number of turns a unit takes is proportional to their Speed. Cycles and Breakpoints. Cycles are a mechanic found in certain combat challenges such as the Forgotten Hall. The first cycle at the start of each wave in a battle lasts for 150 AV. Once the first cycle has passed, subsequent cycles last for 100 AV each. This is the cause for many commonly-quoted breakpoints, along with some Planar Ornament set effect requirements. Action Value Modification. In combat, there are 2 ways to modify the current Action Value: Modifying SPD, or advancing\/delaying action. The former changes the Base Action Value while the latter does not. After a SPD modification, the current Action Value is affected as follows: formula_3 In other words, the remaining time until the unit's next turn is prorated according to the speed change. Action Advancement and Action Delay work as follows: formula_4 In other words, the time until the unit's next turn is advanced or delayed by a percentage of the unit's full turn time. Immediately Take Action. Effects described to make a target \"immediately take action\" are different from those that \"forward action by 100%.\" Such effects forcibly set the current Action Value of the target to 0, regardless of their Action Value prior to that. Therefore, \"immediately take action\" effects will still fully advance the target even if their Action Value is greater than their Base Action Value due to action delay effects, while \"forward action by 100%\" effects do not. However, if an \"immediately take action\" is applied during another character's turn, the current character will still need to finish their turn first before the target who had their action advanced can take action. Status Effect Duration. Some status effects unconditionally tick down at the end of the character's turn, while others only tick down if they were present at the start of that turn. All SPD modifying statuses fall into the latter category. For example, if uses her Ultimate in the middle of an ally's turn (including herself), the duration of Astral Blessing's SPD Boost will not decrease at the end of that ally's turn. The upshot is that using a SPD boost during the target character's turn gets the most out of its effect, whereas using it just before the target character's turn is the most wasteful. Enemy Speed. Enemies have a predetermined Base SPD. Their SPD will also increase according to their level starting from Level 65."}

Details: This was my favorite food while touring around the Xianzhou Luofu. Unfortunately, this streamer (y'know, the one with read hair? I dunno if she's from the Xianzhou, but she seems to know everything about the Xianzhou) made the place go viral with her videos, so it was packed out with people and doing great business. I barely got a table when I came, and had to wait so long. The menu squeezed so many options onto it that it was really hard to order. My breathing sped up and I started to have a panic attack when I looked at the menu. But whatever I ended up ordering, it was delicious. Really it was so delicious that I couldn't really think of any more adjectives to describe it. Every bite off the fork (sorry, I haven't mastered the art of using chopsticks yet! But luckily they have other cutlery) was its own surprise. The Garlic-infused Pork was yum, the Granny Chen's Tofu was yum, and the Crisped Melon and Diced Chicken was yum, too. Every dish was so delicious and it felt like I was exploring new flavor sensations in my mouth over and over again. It's hard to imagine what kind of beast the meat here is cut from. Definitely super fresh and gamy, but also hearty. The Chili Oil Beef Offal Stew was unforgettable \u2014 the real meaning of a \"master chef.\" You could see the boss lady (who is also the head chef) personally performing knife work, whizzing to slice perfect strips of beef offals. Here, the chili oil slowly boiled soaked into the beef offal just so. I meant to ask the boss lady whether she was five thousand years old or something, seeing as I heard everyone on the Xianzhou lives so long. She must have honed that knife technique of hers over thousands of years. Otherwise, she must be a martial master with the knife that conceals her fame in this ordinary place! Different from Starskiff Haven, Aurum Alley's feeling is strange and very deceptive \u2014 just like its name, I have no idea why \"aurumatons\" would lend their name to this district. Spices Supreme is the same: it looks normal enough just walking by. But inside it's sparkling clean, and the boss lady is friendly and scrupulous as she cooks up a meal. There're meatballs from some beast called \"999 Handmade Meatballs,\" and the boss lady insists on pounding out the mincemeat 999 times before me, promising this method is the real deal. Luckily, I'm not running a kitchen back home. Otherwise, I would chew them out like, \"See, you guys are all chefs, right? Why is there such a big gap in skil!?\" All in all, I'm very satisfied with everything about this place. If you want to try fresh, special and unique Xianzhou meals, I highly recommend you give this place a go. This restaurant absolutely deserves a 5-star rating!"}

There's a glimmer in his eyes, and I'm always sort of in a trance when looking at him.\" On the press night of \"Stardust Rose\", Julie revealed to the reporters present an interesting story during the rehearsal of \"Stardust Rose\". Julie and Iain both won the Goliards Award for Best Actor and Actress with their performance in \"Theater Story\" last year. A month after winning the award, the two received an invitation from Amy, the playwright of \"Stardust Rose\". Despite this stage couple of the drama world having already worked together many times before, Julie said with a smile that she still couldn't resist the unique charm of her old colleague. \"Stardust Rose\" is co-directed by two Goliards Award winners for Best Direction of a Play, and is romance novelist Amy's first stage play. Iain felt it was a little different from the typical romances, not just because it was co-directed by two well-known directors, but also because \"I felt amazing chemistry with Julie during rehearsals.\" Iain tells us that during one rehearsal, Julie's skirt got tangled in a nearby prop. But because of the strong rapport between them \u2014 thanks to their countless past collaborations \u2014 Iain immediately caught Julie, and within the short duration of the changing backdrops, was able to help untangle her skirt. Julie revealed that in this sudden incident, catching her was considered by director Jeffrey to be a \"stroke of genius,\" which happened to perfectly fit the scene of the botanist played by Julie being trapped: \"Alice is a botanist who is completely immersed into her career as a researcher. She is a little out of touch with the rest of society, so she doesn't know how to call for help, even when she's in a tight spot.\" \"But Howard's actions come from the heart.\" Taking this into consideration, Iain told us that because of this incident, this stage direction was written into the official script. \"Throughout the rehearsals of \"Stardust Rose\", we were infected with a wonderful atmosphere. While we had to perform in front of many people, as the plot developed toward the end, I think we must have entered a kind of blissful detachment, it felt really magical.\" Julie believes that \"Stardust Rose\" has a unique romantic atmosphere, different from all the plays she had acted in before. \"It's like being infected by love,\" Iain added.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=13603","text":"Starskiff A Starskiff is a flying vehicle used by the people of Xianzhou Alliance for transportation as part of their everyday lives. They appear to resemble boats of varying sizes. In the Xianzhou language, they refer to any vehicle that can fly as a \"starskiff,\" much like outworlders call them \"spaceships.\" Overview. Organization. Starskiff traffic, inspection, maintenance, aviation, navigation, and trade within the Xianzhou is managed by the Sky-Faring Commission. The Department of Aviation in the Sky-Faring Commission is specifically responsible for relevant aviation tasks such as receiving, verifying and managing the reports of vessels entering and exiting its jurisdiction, the registration of new starskiffs, and the dynamic monitor system. Starskiffs on the Luofu are grown in Stargazer Navalia. They are used by various merchant guilds and by the Cloud Knights. Design and Specifications. Growth Process. Starskiffs are grown, not manufactured, which may come as a surprise to most outworlders. Starskiffs are grown from starskiff seeds. Developed from the Ambrosial Arbor, a starskiff seed acts a blueprint as all of the growth data for a starskiff is stored inside its seed. In other words, these seeds come with their own \"design manuscripts,\" and each seed grows step-by-step based on the design plan. A culture medium injector and cultivation cabin are used to grow the starskiff seed inside the incubator. The incubator is filled with the culture medium that supports the starskiff seed during the germination phase, and it can ensure the biological material grows in a nutritious and controllable environment. In the absence of any external stimulus and with sufficient nutrition, a starskiff seed will grow into a keel in one go. If regular plants were to be placed in the culture medium, they would grow exponentially. Generally, the ratio of catalyzers in the culture medium is fixed. However, it can be adjusted based on the design of the ship. Depending on the composition ratio, the strength and growth speed of the hull will vary. There are craftsmen from the Artisanship Commission who specialize in researching the ratio needed for the culture medium during the germination phase, so as to make the ship lighter, more durable, and safer. There are many cylindrical \"culture medium injectors\" at various phases along the starskiff assembly line to make fine-tuned adjustments to it as it grows. There are four main stages in the growth of a starskiff: the germination phase, the embryonic phase, the nutritive phase, and the forming phase. During the germination phase, materials such as Fallow Earth and Ligneous Freeroamers inside the starskiff seed will form the earliest signs of seed germ and embryo. If anything goes wrong during the growth process, the failed starskiff seed needs to be cleared out and the biological matter in the metal frame needs to be destroyed. The embryonic phase is the most important stage in shaping the starskiff. If the temperature and culture medium isn't regulated properly, or if the design data has any errors, then the starskiff seed will fail to grow as designed. A failed seed can still be cleared out at this stage, though some fast-growing anomalies can burst through the incubator, causing the culture medium to leak out. When that happens, the incubator basically just gets trashed. This can happen due to errors such as a miscalculated self-growth algorithm of Fallow Earth. The starskiff seeds develop a detailed and complex root system during subsequent phases, which also acts as the internal jade abacus network aboard each starskiff. The toughest biological materials on the exterior will gradually close up, so that the starskiff can continue its core internal operations even when it encounters severe impacts. The starskiff is technically flyable at this stage if a jade wheel is installed. In the nutritive phase, the starskiff has taken shape and is nearly done incubating, developing it's hull, keel and canopy. The circular cutaway on the tail is where the jade wheel gets installed \u2014 that's the starskiff engine. It's an integrated jade abacus that controls gravity and motion. The Meridian Pin at Stargazer Navalia also operates using similar tech principles. During the forming phase, fully-grown starskiffs are extracted from their incubators and temporarily moored at The Mooring platform in Stargazer Navalia following assembly. Propulsion, Movement, and Docking. The jade wheel functions as the starskiff engine. As aforementioned, it's an integrated jade abacus that controls gravity and motion. There are a lot of illegal modders who will exploit this, installing military-grade jade wheels onto civilian starskiffs, which is illegal and highly dangerous. There are mooring platforms all around the Xianzhou for starskiffs to dock. Starskiffs can also function when slightly submerged in water. Armament. Large fighter starskiffs are equipped with turrets that are operated by a gunner. Tactical groupings. Fighter jet starskiffs are typically grouped into Cloud Knight brigades known as Orbital Fleets. Types. Civilian Starskiff. The civilian models are single-pilot vessels that resembles a small sampan boat and appears to have the capacity to hold at least four people. Large cargo seems to be generally stored outside the cockpit on the deck. Freight Starskiff. Freight starskiffs are unmanned models of starskiffs used to transport cargo containers between various locations on the Xianzhou. They are larger and rectangular-shaped. There are three known models; light, medium and heavy. Additional \"carriages\" can be attached behind these starskiffs in order to ferry more cargo. Fighter Jet Starskiff. Fighter starskiffs are generally used by the Cloud Knights air force. Large fighter starskiffs need to be operated in pairs. One pilot takes the helm, the other controls the turrets. Star Jet. The star jet is a type of starskiff mentioned in a Management Strategy for Reporting Starskiff Traffic. Competition Fly Ship. A competition fly ship is a type of starskiff mentioned in a Management Strategy for Reporting Starskiff Traffic. It is presumably used for sport in some form of competitive flying. Yaoqing Starskiff. Starskiffs on the Yaoqing are born with biotechnology instead of being grown from seeds. Newly born starskiffs are described as \"furry little creatures\". They can even be named, and may join the battlefield after growing in a few short months, becoming loyal partners of the Verdant Knights, capable of eradicating abominations. New starskiffs are born almost every day in Verdant Harbor. Their description resembles the beast ships used by the borisin. Navis Astriger. The Navis Astriger is a type of Cloud Knight troop carrier starskiff. It was used in the Heliobi Wars during the weaponizing of the Yaoqing's auxillary engine. One was forced to land on an ocean planet infested by abominations during Jing Yuan's first expedition before heading back to the Luofu. Baiheng once flew one from the Xianzhou Yaoqing to the Xianzhou Zhuming carrrying a delegation of at least a dozen people. Fu Xuan proposed a plan to use a Navis Astriger to ferry the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope to the Fanghu during the Third Abundance War to send an SOS signal to the Reignbow Arbiter, the plan was carried out by Master Diviner Jing Tian of the Yuque. Navium Astriger. Navium Astriger are the large planet-sized capital ships that form the Xianzhou Alliance. There were only nine known ships that were constructed by the Primeval Imperium civilization that were sent out to seek immortality. Of the nine, only six of the ships still remain to form the Hexafleet."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5892","text":"Starskiff Safety Inspection Guide Starskiff Safety Inspection Guide is a readable found aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. 1. Foreword The management and inspection of starskiffs in the Xianzhou Luofu are usually the direct responsibility of the Sky-Faring Commission's Department of Aviation. The Department of Aviation will conduct random safety inspections on docked starskiffs according to relevant legislations, such as the \"Starskiff Safety Inspection Regulation\" and the \"Regulation on Official Techniques for Starskiff Inspection\". Annual inspections are arranged for starskiffs at the location where they are registered. This is to maintain the Xianzhou's starskiff sailing routes and normal operation of equipment, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the interstellar citizens of the Xianzhou. 2. An Overview on Safety Inspections The Commission will determine the extent of the inspection based on the starskiff's annual maritime report when organizing a starskiff safety inspection. If the annual report and registration details are missing, then the Sky-Faring Commission will dispatch a safety squad to determine the appropriate standards according to the starskiff's type, size, tonnage, and energy efficiency. A specific safety inspection plan will then be set. Any starskiffs that pass the safety inspection will be immediately issued with the \"Sky-Faring Commission Regulated Inspection Report\", and the outcome of the inspection will be recorded in the dynamic starskiff monitoring system. 3. Steps of the Safety Inspection 1) Persons responsible for incoming starskiffs, please first log into the Xianzhou dynamic starskiff monitoring system. The system will compare the information against the registration details of the starskiff to verify whether the vessel had passed the Commission's annual inspection. If you are transporting or in possession of any items that are prohibited or undocumented in the \"Xianzhou Interstellar Trade Regulations\", please report them voluntarily to the monitoring system. 2) Please open your Personal Page in the dynamic starskiff monitoring system and click on \"Recent Registrations\" to find the starskiff you are currently steering. If you see the words \"Inspection Passed,\" you may skip to the Route Planning function in the Safety Inspection menu and proceed to the docks according to the navigated route and voice prompts, register the vessel, and obtain the starskiff temporary pass. 3) If you see the words \"Verify at Dock\" under Recent Registrations after selecting your current starskiff, proceed to Border Control according to the navigated route and voice prompts to wait for verification by the system. Once you have passed verification, you will be issued with a Xianzhou Luofu temporary pass per standard workflow. 4) If you see the words \"Physical Inspection\" under Recent Registrations after selecting your current starskiff, please stop the vessel immediately. Please prepare relevant documents such as Crew Adjustment Certificates and wait for the Security Department from the Sky-Faring Commission to board the vessel to conduct the inspection. 5) If items that are prohibited or undocumented in the \"Xianzhou Interstellar Trade Regulations\" are found during the physical inspection, the goods will be temporarily confiscated by Cloudford Border Control. The vessel will be fined or prohibited from sailing in accordance with the type of goods confiscated. If the vessel repeats the offense and trades outside of the regulations again within three calendar months, the Sky-Faring Commission's dynamic starskiff monitoring system will permanently remove you from the register. 6) If your vessel is discovered to contain illegal personal modifications such as cabin alterations, expansions, and connections between different rooms during the physical inspection, or if your vessel does not meet the required fire safety and general safety standards (such as outdated aerosol sprays and oxygen insulation bags), we will issue a specific list of issues and required rectifications. Please voluntarily rectify the identified issues according to the list. Should your vessel be found to contain safety breaches again the next time you dock, the Sky-Faring Commission's dynamic starskiff monitoring system will permanently remove you from the register. 7) After passing dock registration, please undergo Cloudford's full-body check with your entire crew, bringing with you appropriate identification documents and your temporary pass. For details of the check, please wait for notifications from the Sky-Faring Commission staff after arriving at the docks or consult documentations within the dynamic starskiff monitoring system."}

Stefan Marquez was the Belobog Minister of Internal Affairs during the tenure of the seventh and the eighth Supreme Guardians of Belobog. He orchestrated the choice of the eighth Guardian Cyrille, and manipulated her behind the scenes for fourteen years. Story. Stefan was the Minister of Internal Affairs of the seventh Supreme Guardian, and as one of the Architects he was a part of the process of finding the next Guardian. When a prodigious girl named Cyrilla was chosen to become the next Supreme Guardian, many Architects visited her home, including Stefan. Unlike the other adults, Stefan never ignored Cyrilla's younger and untalented sister Cyrille and always treated her kindly, slowly gaining her trust. Cyrille started keeping a diary on his advice and mostly wrote about him. He comforted her when she learned that Cyrilla would be taken away by the adults and she might never see her again. He promised her that he wouldn't let that happen and gave her a blue stone as a symbol of their agreement. However, just when the Architects were about to relocate Cyrilla to Qlipoth Fort, she \"mysteriously\" disappeared. After days of searching without any success, the Architects wanted to begin the heir selection process anew, but Stefan strongly pushed for the instatement of Cyrille as the new Supreme Guardian, claiming that he had found Cyrille to be just as talented as Cyrilla and that they should appoint a new Supreme Guardian as soon as possible to avoid political instability after the previous Supreme Guardian's untimely death. The Architects finally agreed after heated internal debate. But the Architects soon learned that Cyrille was an extremely mediocre child and inept in social situations. Stefan and his lackeys gained immense power over Qlipoth Fort and Belobog. Cyrille remained unquestionably loyal to Stefan, who told her to ignore those around her and listen only to him. He also claimed to be still searching for Cyrilla, but couldn't find her. The people grew increasingly angry with their puppet Supreme Guardian, and in the 14th year of her tenure, rebels within the Architects plotted a coup to overthrow Cyrille and Stefan. The rebels won over the Silvermane Guards' Captain and planned to lure the two of them to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. Cyrille attended the military exercise there, but there was no trace of Stefan. A fake patrol of Silvermane Guards shoved Cyrille into an arsenal chest, took her to the far north of Belobog under the cover of darkness, and pushed the chest over a cliff. It is likely that Stefan was also killed in the coup in an unknown way."}

They are considered seeds of disaster which cause massive changes to civilizations and ecosystems, and result in the appearance of Fragmentum. Overview. According to Herta, Stellarons are a type of lifeform with a special property that tethers them to a certain Path or Aeon's power. They respond to the desires of the world to which it is tethered. However, the cost of fulfilling those desires often brings great disaster to the world. There is no known way to destroy a Stellaron; currently, the most that can be done is contain its energy. Stellarons have been known to be capable of communication with a particular person of interest, an example being Cocolia, likely in order to carry out the desires of the world. The Trailblazer, who holds such a Stellaron within their body, is able to hear its voice as well. The Stellaron Hunters, who serve an enigmatic individual known as Elio, scour the world for Stellarons and have obtained several. Their intentions are currently unclear \u2014 Kafka appears to know the Trailblazer's background and implanted a Stellaron in their body for an unknown reason. The Antimatter Legion and Nanook the Destruction may have a connection to Stellarons, due to the frequent appearance of new Stellarons shortly after these destroyers of universes appear on worlds. It is currently unknown if these occurrences are related or just coincidence. Known Stellarons. Herta Space Station. At some point in the past, Herta obtained a Stellaron and hid it within the Herta Space Station. Kafka and Silver Wolf, two Stellaron Hunters, are dispatched by Elio to uncover it and implant it within the Trailblazer for the foreseeable future. They succeed in their task by luring the Antimatter Legion into attacking the space station as a distraction, and depart before the Astral Express' crew can find them, leaving the Trailblazer behind. While battling against the Doomsday Beast, the Trailblazer blocks an attack directed at March 7th, which causes the Stellaron inside them to lose control. However, Welt seals the Stellaron before they are entirely consumed by its energy. Jarilo-VI. Long ago, the Antimatter Legion invaded Jarilo-VI and caused great devastation. The first Supreme Guardian, Alisa Rand, asked the Stellaron for help. The Stellaron fulfilled her wishes by causing a phenomenon that came to be known as the Eternal Freeze: a sudden massive drop in the world's temperature that caused the entire world to freeze over, with the exception of Belobog, which remains humanity's last bastion due to the efforts of The Architects and the Aeon they worship, Qlipoth the Preservation. When the Astral Express arrived on Jarilo-VI, they discovered that the Stellaron was responsible for the Eternal Freeze and had corrupted the current Supreme Guardian, Cocolia Rand. After defeating Cocolia, Welt sealed the Stellaron, though its ecological effects would still remain due to the Stellaron's long duration on the planet. The Xianzhou Luofu. Lord Ravager Phantylia masterminded a plot to smuggle a Stellaron aboard the Xianzhou Luofu with the help of Luocha and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Phantylia's goal was to bring about the self-destruction of the Xianzhou, while Luocha's involvement is implied to be related to his opposition against Yaoshi. The Stellaron Hunters detected this Stellaron and manipulated the Astral Express crew into helping the Luofu with the Stellaron crisis, with the intention of making the Xianzhou indebted to the crew in preparation for a great conflict with Nanook in the future. Phantylia used the revived Ambrosial Arbor to create a physical body for herself, and fought the Astral Express crew and General Jing Yuan with her new body at the Ambrosial Arbor's roots. After Phantylia was defeated, the Stellaron was sealed. Penacony. A Stellaron entered Penacony when it was still a prison planet under the ownership of the Interastral Peace Corporation, during the War of Independence. Its ensuing eruption and the chaos of the war led to the IPC losing control of Penacony. After the war ended, \"people in the shadow with ulterior motives\" had the idea of using the Stellaron's power to help build Penacony's Dreamscape. By the time a representative from The Family arrived at The Watchmaker's call, the Stellaron had already been activated and was seeping into the Primordial Dreamscape. The Family, possessing extensive knowledge of Stellarons, helped the Watchmaker subdue the Stellaron. However, traitors within the Family ensured that the Stellaron was not fully sealed, so its influence would linger within the Dreamscape and tempt people with indulgence and pleasure, using their minds as nourishment for the sweet dream. By the time the Watchmaker realized this, the Family already had a firm grip on Penacony and swiftly quelled any opposition that arose. At the Watchmaker's behest, Gallagher sent Charmony Festival invitations to various factions in the hopes of finding people capable of resolving the Stellaron disaster. It is later revealed that the Stellaron is housed within Penacony Grand Theater. The traitors planned to use the Stellaron's power and the Harmony's song, broadcast through the Charmony Festival, to brainwash everyone on Penacony into following the Path of Order. Though they nearly succeed, their plans are foiled and the Stellaron is sealed by the Astral Express crew. Others. The Jepella Brotherhood accused Kafka of 46 crimes, likely all linked to obtaining a Stellaron. Some of these are: A Stellaron was also present in Kafka's home planet, and while the extent of damage is unknown, she remarks on how she was unable to see how far it fell at the time."}

A Study on the \"Everyday\" Lives of StowawaysThis book aims to shift the public perception of stowaways from mere condemnation to a brief and focused look at their daily lives. The author seeks to foster cross-group communication in order to find new solutions to the enduring issue of stowaways spanning several Amber Eras. Note: This report solely investigates organic beings and Intellitrons who entered the Synesthesia Dreamscape through neighboring starships without proper authorization from the Reverie Hotel. Chapter I: Even Stowaways Have to Work Stowaways from impoverished galaxies often exhaust their savings to board ships that can conduct interstellar warps. They rest in barebones rudimentary cabins, evading The Family's oversight to sneak into the Dreamscape. Contrary to popular perception, unemployed stowaways represent only a tiny proportion in the starships. Faced with the pressures of survival, most stowaways strive to find employment in Penacony. While the job-seeking process is typically difficult for these marginalized individuals, sustaining a daily existence in the thriving Dreamscape can be achieved through simple labor. Meanwhile, unemployed stowaways have their own alternative means of survival, often teaching others in their smaller group something akin to begging. They employ a variety of techniques to beg for Alfalfa credits from visitors in the Penacony Dreamscapes and use the money earned to cover their expenses in reality.Rumors suggest that a revered stowaway, known as the \"Great Sage,\" befriended the legendary Watchmaker through the simple means of begging, thus ascending the social ladder. However, this is likely a sales pitch used by human smugglers to attract potential stowaways. Some stowaways struggle to adapt to the Dreamscape society and continue working in reality, such as in interstellar deliveries or repair services for passing starships. However, the meager income from low-paying reality often falls short of supporting their indulgence in Penacony. Consequently, these stowaways occasionally resort to criminal activities, such as extortion or blackmailing guests. According to the laws established by the Oak Family, stowaways are strictly prohibited in Penacony, as they often face dire consequences when apprehended by the Hounds.However, compared to The Family's pursuit, the damage caused to their brain and psyche by counterfeit Dreampools is even more alarming. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of unprocessed memoria can result in severe physical and mental degradation, with many stowaways succumbing to debilitating psychological disorders in their later years. I have covertly inspected the stowaway ships, but unfortunately, by the time I arrived, a prominent special guest had already left the ship. Rumors suggest that these enigmatic stowaways possess substantial financial resources, using Dreampools no less opulent than those in the Platinum Suite. Some may choose to stow away to conceal their identities from The Family, as even the most notorious criminals in the cosmos can easily alter their appearances and find refuge within the Dreamscape in Penacony. Some stowaways go to great lengths just to catch a glimpse of the Dreamscape in Penacony and then depart on a small vessel afterward. During a private conversation, the captain of a stowaway starship informed me that these stowaways comprise the majority of their clients, as diving into the Dreamscape in this manner proves much more cost-effective than covering the exorbitant rates charged by the Reverie Hotel. As I pen down these words, I find myself marveling at the allure of Penacony. For several Amber Eras, people have been willing to give up everything, just to visit this splendorous dream of Harmony. Part II. Chapter II: Living in a Two-Cubic-Meter Cabin While some stowaways choose to give up buying consumables in reality to extend their stay in the Dreamscape, a survey revealed that 85% of respondents still chose to pay for the robot cleaning services on the ship to keep their rooms clean \u2014 As the putrid scent in the room in reality would otherwise severely degrade their experience in the dream.The cleaning robot on the ship is an outdated IPC model from 2152 AE, with a history longer than the stowaway ship itself. Despite its age, the robot remains functional and diligently attends to the sanitation of 107 compartments in one half of the ship, emitting a melodic hum that praises Qlipoth as it moves. The affordability of its services has even led some stowaways to develop a sense of faith in Preservation. Naturally, it also handles the task of \"cleaning up\" deceased tenants or those who could no longer pay, but stowaways have long grown accustomed to this. The most popular food among stowaways is the \"Instant Vita Serum,\" which solely relies on the IPC's shipping routes for transportation. Originally created by a \"botanical botanist\" (an intelligent plant from the Cexkal system) during the Borderstar Trade War when resources were scarce, the IPC has since acquired the rights for this product. This nutrient fluid has the advantages of affordability and the fact that \"drinking it probably won't kill you, I guess\" and was extensively used during relief efforts in wars. However, it was eventually banned due to potential safety concerns regarding physiological harm, leading to the closure of the production factory. Merchants that had stockpiled large amounts of the nutrient fluid during the war were forced to leave in disappointment, taking with them enough nutrient fluids that could last two planets for three Amber Eras. That was when an affordable life-support product emerged throughout the cosmos. In certain star systems, a bottle of nutrient fluid may be worth less than the excrement of a local creature.Experienced stowaways collect empty cans to sell the alloy to the captain at discounted prices. However, they discreetly keep this knowledge from rookies, as that would lead to receiving hush money from the captain. \"By the way, does this stuff have a shelf life?\"\"Well, drinking it probably won't kill you, I guess.\" Due to prolonged exposure to low-gravity environments, organic stowaways face additional health risks compared to inorganic ones. Common ailments include osteoporosis and endocrine disorders. The cost of daily cabin environmental conditioning, amounting to 10,000 credits a day, remains unaffordable for the majority of stowaways.In the face of these challenges, stowaways who have not yet had a mental collapse due to the effects of high concentrations of memoria ultimately resort to extensive body modifications to gain some extra hours of sleep each day. \"Look at me now. All I need to do is dive into the Dreamscape. If only I could never have to wake up.\" During an interview with a stowaway named \"Beta,\" it came to my attention that he only had one-tenth of his head left and an inorganic shell weighing about 29 kilograms. After learning about my identity, he kept cursing the captain for deducting the money earned from selling his organic body parts. He insisted on gifting me the last bottle of his much-cherished nutrient solution, as he can rely solely on sub-par batteries for his survival. \"Well, drinking it probably won't kill you, I guess.\" While writing this section at the Reverie Hotel, an inorganic guest approached me and requested the bottle of nutrient solution. He then invited me to his miniature garden, where he poured the nutrient solution on one of the flowers, causing it to come to life and greet me."}

In the third quarter of this fiscal year, the Studio's revenue amounted to \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Alfalfa credits, a year-to-year decrease of 19.2% and a quarter-to-quarter decrease of 10.2%. Net profit stood at \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Alfalfa credits, a year-to-year decrease of 17% and a quarter-to-quarter increase of 0.7%. Animation revenue for approximately 33% of the total, reaching \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Alfalfa credits, showing a 27% year-to-year decrease.During the first three quarters, two Clockie movies and 37 episodes of the Clockie animation series were released, of which the ninth season of the new Clockie series and \"Clockie's Big Adventure: Oceania\" accounted for 49% and 51% respectively.It is clear that animation remains a vital aspect of the Studio's business. However, the missing Chairman caused an impact on the production capacity for the \"Clockie\" series, resulting in a significant downturn in ticket sales and the growth of revenue. Image licensing revenue accounted for approximately 29%, reaching \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Alfalfa credits.Throughout the quarter, products such as Dressable Clockie, Origami Bird Drone, and Mini Brother Hanu Game Console, released in collaboration with Pikapi Toys Factory, achieved favorable results in the market. The Studio will continue investing in relevant products to facilitate the production of higher-quality merchandise.The Legal Department is actively seeking a solution to the upcoming risk of image copyright expiration and striving to reach a legal consensus with Interastral Peace Entertainment as soon as possible. Clock Studios Theme Park generated a revenue of \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Alfalfa credits, accounting for approximately 18% of the total. Due to the promotion of the Charmony Festival, the theme park's capability in attracting customers and revenue has significantly increased. Investments in iterating amusement programs yielded a positive response, with a 15% rate of return. Investments in visitor services achieved the highest rate of return at approximately 24%. It is expected that during Charmony Festival, the Clockie Celebration will break through the profit highpoint in the fourth quarter. Revenue from other investment projects accounted for approximately 9%, reaching \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Alfalfa credits.Notably, the investment and development of dream bubble movies emerged as a new growth driver for Penacony's entertainment industry. Market forecasts suggest that dream bubble movies may surpass traditional movies within half an Amber Era and become the new cornerstone of Dreamscape Media. The Clockie IP will remain the flagship product of Clock Studios for the foreseeable future. However, it is currently facing several challenges. Our inventory of \"Clockie\" animation content is nearly depleted and the highly-anticipated \"Dreamville Legend\" series, which has been in development for five years, must be released in theaters next quarter.The finance department emphasizes the urgency of establishing contact with the Chairman to make new strategic decisions. Failure to do so could pose a significant risk to the financial stability of Clock Studios' capital chain."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=20493","text":"Summary of the Luofu's Ambrosial Arbor Crisis Summary of the Luofu's Ambrosial Arbor Crisis is a readable found aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. ...&lt;br&gt; As we are well aware, following the destruction of the Ambrosial Arbor by the Arbiter's divine arrow and how it was discarded by the people, the Alchemy Commission and everything it stood for underwent a profound transformation. However, over time, we started neglecting the perils of the past, despite being long-life species who retain memories. The re-allocation of power from the Alchemy Commission to other organizations was never fully complete, and we have lacked in monitoring and correcting the behavior of Alchemy Commission's members. These oversights were the fundamental cause of the crisis surrounding the Arbor's resurrection. A significant portion of the apprehended Disciples of Sanctus Medicus in this operation were affiliated with the Alchemy Commission. Our inquiries among innocent members of the Commission revealed an atmosphere permeated by nostalgia for past authority and status, coupled with discontent with the current status quo, and a sympathy toward Sanctus Medicus and its mastermind, Dan Shu. The deep-rooted origins of the Sanctus Medicus scourge must not be underestimated. From the accounts of her accomplishments, Dan Shu appeared remarkably virtuous, even considered exemplary among healers on the Xianzhou. She authored medical texts, formulated prescriptions, and received numerous accolades. Following the banishment of the previous head of the Commission, Yunhua, amidst a dispute regarding the Vidyadhara, Dan Shu assumed practical leadership of the Alchemy Commission in the Luofu. If not for this incident, she might have become the head of the Commission. I am aware that the other Six Charioteers want to see a Luofu Alchemy Commission without a nominal head, perhaps believing it the only way to ensure the Commission stays harmless. However, it is precisely within the context of a leaderless Alchemy Commission that nefarious leaders like Dan Shu can emerge. My assistants and I have thoroughly examined all administrative documents of the Alchemy Commission spanning the past seventy years. The records of Dan Shu's inhumane experiments and her correspondence with suspected Vidyadhara Preceptors indicate that this incident was not an impulsive rebellion by individuals masquerading in the name of an ancient cult, as it may seem, but rather a meticulously organized conspiracy. To prevent further turmoil, I implore the Ten Lords to issue a decree for further dissolution and monitoring of the Alchemy Commission, to apprehend and interrogate the Vidyadhara Preceptors implicated in this incident, and recall the former head Yunhua for further investigations. ...&lt;br&gt; \"\"The Ten-Lords Commission does not have the authority to intervene in the appointment of government officials. Let the Six Charioteers decide on Yunhua on their own. As for the Vidyadhara... there is also very little we can do. As the situation is already turbulent enough, it would be unwise to escalate the conflict at this point. Besides, the suspects have already surfaced and have been identified, have they not?\" \u2014 Hanya, Judge of the Interrogation Division\""}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34453","text":"Supernatural Encounters in Paperfold Academy Supernatural Encounters in Paperfold Academy is a Readable found on Penacony. Text. I. A Memory Zone Meme originated from the Crisis Era is hidden beneath the library of Paperfold Academy. Unlike ordinary memes, this meme has gained a human-like appearance and intelligence due to prolonged exposure to humans and become extremely cunning. It was eventually imprisoned under the library with the combined efforts of the Bloodhound Family, Garden of Recollection, and the IPC. Paperfold Academy was constructed in the Moment of Sol specifically to suppress this meme though the collective subconscious of students. Many of the techniques employed in constructing dreams were actually extracted from this meme by The Family. During the silent hours of the night, you might hear the faint sounds of crying emanating from the basement of the library. That's indicating that The Family is once again interrogating the meme. \"HalovianBeauty: \"During the silent hours of the night?\" That's never happening in the Moment of Sol.\"\"SupersmartRoboball: I've been teaching in the academy for an Amber Era and never heard of anything like that. What's your student ID?\" II. The emergency exit of the Glaux Building that aligns with the Moment of Midnight is haunted. This rumor has persisted at Paperfold Academy for centuries. The spirit, wearing a purple dress and bearing a mirror, has long hair that sprawls across the ground like snakes. When you encounter that spirit, you will realize that everyone around you is missing. Some bolder students have tried to approach the spirit, only to find that the distance between them remains unchanged. In the end, the spirit will let out a sigh, and the unfortunate student will awaken from the dream. There are similar records within the fringe areas in other Moments. It is rumored that a Dreamchaser, who engaged in unsavory deeds during the Pioneering Era, was consumed by a meme in the desert, leading to her soul wandering within the Moment of Midnight ever since. Whenever gaps emerge, she will infiltrate into other Moments. \"SchoolSkipper: In our department's version, the spirit is a Dreamweaver student who didn't graduate on time.\"\"Don'tTouchMyFluffBall: That's scary! The Moment of Midnight, right? I'm not dreaming tonight.\"\"RedBucketHero: My mom has heard that story, too, but she said the spirit sacrificed herself to protect the Dreamchasers.\" III. The Watchmaker's Legacy is actually hidden within Paperfold Academy. The Watchmaker has generously made numerous donations to Paperfold Academy's dreamweaving project. Despite being the most successful entrepreneur in Penacony, he never asks for anything in return from the academy. This raises the question: Why? The most plausible explanation could be that he is an alumnus of the academy! In this case, it would make perfect sense for him to support and bestow his legacy upon his alma mater. Furthermore, when you talk about the Watchmaker, what places may come to your mind? The extravagant ball in the Blue Hour? The amusement park in the Moment of Stars? Or Clock Studios Theme Park? If we flip the question around, Paperfold Academy would be the least expected location for his hidden treasures! Secret treasures are typically found in the most unexpected of places. So, what are you still waiting for? We are now recruiting members for our treasure-hunting team to look for the treasure on campus. Once we discover the treasure, all the wealth will be divided equally among the team members. \"RobinFan099: I thought this section was about supernatural encounters? Where are the mods?\"\"ForgetHer: OP really should double check on the logic of this post. I for real thought a meme wrote this.\"\"GreatWisdom (OP): @ForgetHer, have you really forgotten her tho?\"\"ForgetHer: @GreatWisdom, **** you!\""}

He also assists Clara in battle. Profile. He is a robot and dormant relic from an ancient civilization who was inadvertently reactivated by Clara. Appearance. Svarog is a tall, dark blue mech with a glowing pink cyclopean eye. He wears black pants and shoes as well as a fur jacket with multiple openings that expose his shoulders. Personality. As a robot, Svarog does not convey emotions nor does he trust humans, believing them to be unpredictable and dangerous. The lone exception is Clara, who he treats as his daughter and protects her in battle. He's highly calculating, ensuring that all of his decisions are the right course of action to protect humanity, despising conflicts such ones that arise from Wildfire and the Vagrants. According to Clara, \"preservation\" is his responsibility, so he in turn longs for peace and coexistence. Story. Svarog is an ancient mech which was reactivated by Clara sometime before the events of the game. Seeing her cry caused Svarog to take her in as his adopted daughter, and he would try to locate her real family despite her insistence otherwise. He began playing a more active role in managing the Underworld after the Silvermane Guards sealed off the Underworld and took control of all the ownerless robots. Claiming to be a \"guardian of humanity,\" Svarog and his forces occupied the Furnace Core hub to stop any threats coming from the Overworld and the Underworlders from leaving, believing that the Underworlders were not strong enough to handle the threat of Fragmentum in the Overworld. He also notably refused to negotiate with Wildfire, deeming them to be a threat. After a large Geomarrow vein was discovered in the Underworld, the miners of Boulder Town and various vagrants began fighting over it. Svarog accompanied Clara to the vein in the Great Mine and had his forces scatter the groups. Seeing the Trailblazer, Dan Heng and March 7th prompted him to leave to protect the Furnace Core due to external variables. The Astral Express, who sought to save the world from the Stellaron disaster, needed Svarog's help in obtaining information regarding it. They were able to convince Clara to grant an audience with him, but during negotiations, the mention of the word caused him to consider them high-level threats and attack them. He was eventually defeated, and after being repaired, allowed them to access files relating to it after considering the outsiders' presence and Clara's request. Eventually, following Cocolia's death and Bronya succeeding her, Svarog considered his first mission \u2014 protecting the Underworld, complete. Luka would eventually challenge Svarog to a duel to see his standing as an Underworld fighter, which he accepted. Svarog held back during the fight, but was impressed by Luka's performance, stating that he would remember it and would re-evaluate his stance on humanity's limits. When an automaton named Pascal began stealing parts and other automatons began attacking it, Svarog deduced that because it had been repairing itself with Fragmentum-contaminated materials, the automatons in the base network had likewise considered it a threat. Due to this, Svarog suggested that he format and integrate Pascal's data into the base network, though it would remove its emotional intelligence. Clara instead suggested placing a \"lock\" on Pascal, clearing redundant data and making sure that it would not harm people. Regardless of the Trailblazer's decision, Svarog honors their request and follows their advice. When Topaz arrives to Jarilo-VI to claim it for the Interastral Peace Corporation, she meets Svarog and Clara in his base. Aware of her identity and motives, Svarog learns from her that she is looking for the automatons in the Old Weapon Testing Ground left behind by the organization 700 years ago. He agrees to help her as he calculates a high chance of compliance via force if he refused and could sense she wanted to help the planet. No conflict happens between Svarog and Topaz in the whole process. When they arrive at the Old Weapon Testing Ground, Svarog reveals that the Architects of Jarilo-VI have never activated the automatons made by the IPC 700 years ago, and that the overwhelming majority of the combatants against the Antimatter Legion were human. After Topaz decides to let the planet be, she gives Clara the Source Code, which Svarog believes was the right decision."}

Text. To the General Affairs Office, Under the wise guidance of the Six Charioteers and the Ten-Lords Commission, the Disciple of Sanctus Medicus' conspiracy, headed by Dan Shu, to take advantage of the Ambrosial Arbor to overturn the Luofu has been thwarted. All the culprits have been apprehended and their leader has been annihilated. All on the Xianzhou Luofu exerted their efforts together to snap this catastrophe in its bud. However, while Dan Shu's rebellion has been suppressed, its aftermath has caused severe effects on the lives of ordinary civilians. Here is a report on recent events. Firstly, due to the impact of Dan Shu's rebellion, a faction of unruly individuals instigated public unrest against the alchemists and healers of the Alchemy Commission. Last week, a group of ruffians defaced the temporary site of the Alchemy Commission, openly denounced all the commissions on the Xianzhou, and propagated the heresy that only the Ruin Author will bring an end to the plague. Some civilians even broke into the former Alchemy Commission site to plunder supplies, resulting in physical altercations with the Cloud Knights on guard there. Currently, all troublemakers have been apprehended by the Cloud Knights, and further investigations have shown that they are all outworlders hired by the Annihilation Gang. We are currently collaborating with the Cloud Knights to suppress these riots and have arrested all individuals responsible. This case is currently under trial. Secondly, the Realm-Keeping Commission, in recent collaboration with the Sky-Faring Commission, has apprehended a gang of criminals suspected of smuggling Xianzhou native creatures to the outworlds. This operation has led to the arrest of fifteen suspects and the shutdown of ten processing and warehousing facilities. The criminal group had been smuggling and stockpiling a significant number of biological samples from the Xianzhou under the guise of research activities, disguising the goods as trade commodities to be exported. We followed their trail and while destroying their headquarters, we also apprehended former Disciples of Sanctus Medicus on the run who are planning on smuggling themselves out of the Xianzhou. This case is currently under trial. Thirdly, various unaffiliated individuals on social media platforms have been making claims that the Ambrosial Arbor, after its resurrection, emits an ominous aura that accelerates the onset of mara. This rumor has spread widely among the residents and caused panic. Certain groups believing in the Firmamend Arbiter cited their myth as evidence and argued that a colossal wall must be built around the Arbor to completely ward off its potential effects for eternity. These outworld groups even proposed their plans and submitted them to the Realm-Keeping Commission. However, the feasibility of their plans are absurd, and the costs involved are enormous. After being rejected several times, these groups have resorted to soliciting donations from the public and promoting their view that the construction of a wall can ward off the demonic aura. They are currently facing legal consequences for engaging in illegal fundraising activities. Fourthly, following the Ambrosial Arbor's rebirth, certain merchants have deliberately spread false information for personal gain. They claim that the Lunarescent Depths possess the ability to suppress the ominous aura from the Arbor, and thus begun promoting the water from that sea as a medicinal remedy. Some more extreme cases have seen shops promoting ordinary salt as \"Lunarescent Depths Salt\" and sold it at exorbitant prices, inciting people to stockpile salt. Such actions have severely disrupted the market order and have wildly influenced commodity prices. Currently, the Realm-Keeping Commission is cracking down on a handful of prominent merchants involved in this deception, imposing fines and revoking their licenses. Fifthly, due to the lack of trust in the Alchemy Commission after the disaster, medical scams have proliferated. The primary victims of these scams are elderly Xianzhou natives who have sought treatment from the Alchemy Commission before, have suffered the loss of their children during the calamity, and are old enough to become mara-struck soon. Swindlers use hooks such as giving out free food to get these people, then employ various methods such as presenting themselves as health experts, miracle-working doctors, or anti-Alchemy-Commission progressives to offer health products that purportedly delay the effects of mara. They exploit the victims' trust, spread rumors, and capitalize on anxiety, while falsely advertising these health products as elixirs and selling them at incredibly high prices. The Realm-Keeping Commission has apprehended numerous suspects and dismantled their sales channels. Additionally, we have published anti-fraud notices in each residential community, making residents aware of frauds and suspicious individuals. Sixthly, at the beginning of this month, the Sky-Faring Commission and the Realm-Keeping Commission thwarted a case involving the illegal departure of a collective group at Cloudford. The organization, known as the \"Sunrise Traveling Group,\" primarily comprises elderly widows, widowers, and people who have lost their children but have not yet succumbed to mara. These members refer to each other as family, claiming to find solace in their spiritual companionship after losing their blood relatives. Based on their statements, they started exploring spiritual therapies such as meditation and spiritualism due to them feeling at a loss over the purpose of their lives. During their meditative sessions, many members experienced the shared vision of a black sun hanging in the sky, which they refer to as \"Obsidian of Desolation.\" The organizers of the group purchased books and coordinates related to the \"Obsidian of Desolation\" from the black market in Aurum Alley, subsequently organizing this pilgrimage for the group members. The Realm-Keeping Commission is highly concerned regarding this matter and has at the earliest opportunity dissuaded the group to return. Currently, we are investigating the organizers and have arranged for the rest of the group to return home or accept priority treatment from the Alchemy Commission. We plan to organize community workers who specialize in caring for seniors to monitor the mental status of the group members. Furthermore, we will intensify our monitoring of Aurum Alley's markets to eradicate illegal peddlers with dubious backgrounds. In summary, while Dan Shu's rebellion has been quelled, its repercussions have had a significant impact on various aspects within the community, including matters of faith, the business environment, and even the credibility of authority. While these issues may appear minor and isolated, a closer examination reveals their interconnections, as several of these cases involve organizations beyond the Xianzhou Alliance and other religious beliefs. For the next step, the Realm-Keeping Commission will prioritize its efforts to calm the people's minds and strengthen their spiritual and unity. I submit this report to you, Commissioner, and eagerly await your assessment of the public's general mood. Additionally, the Exalting Sanctum Chancery would like to hire more transferred over from other departments as we are currently severely understaffed. Yours Respectfully, Dahao, Official of the Realm-Keeping Commission"}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34593","text":"Excerpts from Dreamscape Crime Files Excerpts from \"Dreamscape Crime Files\" is a readable found on Penacony. Text. This file documents individuals who have caused significant social harm and posed a serious threat to the security of the Dreamscape.Following a verdict, the Bloodhound Family will archive this file. Name: DomandaCharges: Three counts, including illegal possession of prohibited weapons, false accusations, and terrorist attacks. Domanda arrived in Penacony as a Dreamchaser early in early 2155 AE. Initially employed by the Alfalfa Family to assist the Nightingale Family with the foundations of the dreamweaving project, Domanda encountered a meme attack during an operation, resulting in severe damage to his electronic components. Unable to continue his work, he was persuaded by the Alfalfa Family and voluntarily left during 2155 AE. Subsequently, due to the deterioration and malfunctioning of his logical and Intellitron parts, Domanda made multiple unsuccessful attempts to publicly harass and extort the Alfalfa Family by fabricating false accusations. Utilizing knowledge from his dreamweaving days, he intentionally caused several building collapses and meme-generation events in various locations, including the Golden Hour and Blue Hour, resulting in psychological damage of various degrees to a total of 1,958 individuals. Among them, 35 individuals require special memoria medication for the remainder of their lives. Once the culprit is apprehended, the annihilation process will commence immediately. Name: BarnosCharges: 7 counts, including unlawful possession of prohibited weapons, aiding and organizing illegal entry into Dreamscape, and assaulting law enforcement officers of the Bloodhound Family. Barnos arrived in Penacony as a Dreamchaser toward the end of 2155 AE and settled there. Later, due to his wife's illness, he attempted to auction a hundred years of his life's usage in the Moment of Dusk but to no avail. Subsequently, he engaged in a fight with a Pepeshi merchant who won the auction for \"lifetime\" in an unsuccessful attempt to snatch the auctioned item. As a result, Barnos was expelled and developed antisocial ideation. Between the late 2155 AE and early 2156 AE, Barnos repeatedly assisted stowaways in exchange for large sums of money. Consequently, over two thousand stowaways made it to Penacony, with more than two hundred remaining unaccounted for, despite several searches conducted by the Bloodhound Family. In his final years of criminal activities, Barnos incorporated some of the stowaways into his team. According to his subordinates, he mistreated his followers due to their lack of legal status. Eventually, his failure to distribute the spoils equally led his followers to report him to the Bloodhounds, resulting in his apprehension. Name: LamuinCharges: 7 counts, including illegal smuggling of prohibited drugs, market disruption, and distribution of dangerous substances. Lamuin arrived in Penacony in the middle of 2156 AE as a travelling merchant. However, a joint investigation by The Family and the IPC revealed that his merchant certificate was obtained through bribery. The individuals involved in the fraudulent activity have been investigated and punished accordingly. Initially, Lamuin sold illegal psychotropic drugs in Penacony and engaged in fraud to sustain himself. Later, he colluded with local criminals to smuggle a significant quantity of memoria products into Penacony via his merchant certificate, gaining market share through dumping practices. This posed a serious safety hazard, as his drugs had not been verified and approved by the Garden of Recollection and Penacony quality control authorities. After the Bloodhounds dismantled his illegal industrial chain, Lamuin disappeared for six months. Upon resurfacing, he poisoned guests at The Reverie Hotel in reality as an act of retaliation against The Family. This incident resulted in a total of 130 individuals being hospitalized, three of whom died. Subsequently, the Bloodhounds conducted a thorough search. Lamuin ingested poison in a bathroom in the hotel, committing suicide."}

This poetic name represents the two designers' understanding of Belobog's life and working style. \"Belobog is a place overloaded with orders. In this city, no matter who you are, if you express your thoughts, dress the way you like, or lead a life with individuality, you will be deemed a 'dissenter' by everyone. We sensed this conflict and wanted to use our design to fix it.\" Suburbia has been focused on creating unique outfits that also suit the taste of the young people: Whether it be an eye-catching leather jacket, colorful synthetic leather, phenomenal vest sets, goth long coat, or the famous Belobog-wide modified military uniform... Though all these styles incorporate the current mainstream street fashion, it still has a lot of original Suburbian elements in it. Though it's a very young brand, Suburbia confidently uses the core element of traditional culture. Other than that. we've also seen the two designers' greater ambitions: \"We're trying to create a space-time relationship with this world. Not only should we have Belobog's present, we must also contain everything in Belobog's past. To be honest. we prefer the period in history when the Eternal Freeze has not yet occurred. The world was separated into different regions, each with its own style. \"Suburbia\" doesn't exist just for Belobog, but also for the areas buried in wind and snow,\" explained Richard and Dyanna. Recently, this young brand cooperated with the Edelweiss Workshop for the first time, and began a collab fashion line including leather boots, outfits, and accessories. The two brands used the blue color of Belobog as the design base, together with retro patterns found in Belobog's picture books and in combination with fashionable styles preferred by the modern youth, such street punk and industrial. Edelweiss Workshop has also brought back both classical and new-age fashion concepts to young people."}

It was the Master of Destruction that set free the imprisoned Firesmith clan and bestowed upon them the mark of Destruction which in turn granted the Firesmiths unlimited power. Despite the inability to move around like an able-bodied man, the chief of Firesmith obtained true freedom, for he was no longer imprisoned just for his extraordinary skills and talents in the art of Firesmithing. The chief poured in all his resentment and humiliation into the forge and would never be tired, not even by days of non-stop hammering. Upon one hammering after another, the once stubborn and proud antimatter creatures had to eventually change their form and give in to the remolding by the Destroyer.

In this scorching world of lava, as long as the smelting and hammering never ceased, creation and destruction were no longer polar opposites of each other. Surtur was especially good at using the molten magma that erupted from active volcanoes to infuse the Legion's creatures with a violent aura of destruction. Neither the bubbling of toxic gases nor the gurgling of magma could interrupt Surtur's concentration at the forge. Though burning waves of molten rock would splash on Surtur's fireproof apron of giant firelizard skin, the leather never lost its luster when the flames faded. A massive proportion of the Legion's fighting forces were repeatedly hammered and smelted in the forge until their flesh and weaponry were fused together by the Firesmiths, becoming weapons of Destruction. \"This incomparable power of destruction...\" The Firesmiths who control the flames have never hidden the terrible aspirations they place in their weapons."}

The dazzling light of the furnace, the sparks of metal clashing, and the long-lasting forging process can turn the raw ore into a fine weapon, but can also gradually strip the firesmith of their eyesight. One day, at the bottom of a volcano, Foy found a deposit of rare obsidian flame crystal. From this, he carefully polished a pair of protective goggles, which transformed the fierce sparks of fire into pale-white silhouettes. However, the greedy smith was unable to fully escape his cursed fate either, burning everything he was into cinders in the ultimate fire. Foy deemed the Antimatter Legion in the Warforge as the raw materials for his creations, and himself as the rising flame. \"I wonder... is it possible to harness the power of a thermonuclear reaction in my furnace?\" Foy's pursuit of the ultimate fire came to an unfruitful end in an out-of-control thermonuclear fusion."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=18705","text":"Flint Emperor The Flint Emperor, also known as the Primordial Flame, is the leader of the Heliobi. After being defeated by the Xianzhou Alliance during the Heliobi Wars, it was imprisoned on the Xianzhou Zhuming as its plaguemark with many of their kind, sentenced to serve as a power source for the ship's engines and furnaces for the rest of its eternal life. Overview. It is said that a living flame slumbers in the engine of the Zhuming. It is a creature the Xianzhou regarded as a great enemy in the old days \u2014 the Flint Emperor, who was also called the Primordial Flame. The craftsmen of the Zhuming used every means available to imprison it in the furnace and used its power to forge various divine weapons. The Flint Emperor is currently imprisoned in the Flamedisk Forge Palace, also known to the Artisanship Commission craftsmen as the Pseudo Sun because of how bright it is. It is confined in an invisible cell to immobilize it and can also seal it's light. Special ingenia are placed in the prison to continuously deplete its energy. Anyone in contact with it must wear a talisman or reside in an isolated room to avoid its influence on the mind. General Huaiyan has unrestricted access to visit the Flint Emperor. History. The Xianzhou first came to contact with the heliobi during the Lone Voyage Era, before the Xianzhou Natives turned into a long-life species. The Heliobi penetrated the ships' vaults to appear before the Xianzhou aristocrats, declaring themselves a shapeless and rootless race, beseeching Xianzhou to give them a safe berth. The species were adept at creating mirages and illusions to tempt humans. Thus, the people of Xianzhou became addicted to these wondrous creatures of pure energy and indulged in frolicking with them. The Heliobi soon exposed their true colors as the they tried to take humans' bodies, drain their emotions, and control their will. This was known as the Possession Tragedy or 'Occupation Tragedy', from which the Xianzhou Zhuming suffered the greatest. During the Heliobi Wars, the Heliobi formed a red micro-star in an attempt to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad, led by the Reignbow, disassemble and weaponize the ship's auxiliary engines to fight the Heliobi. The Xianzhou's suicide squad send the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star formed by the Heliobi, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. The Xianzhou artisans ultimately bound the heliobi within shapeless prisons and sentenced them to provide energy for Xianzhou for all eternity. The defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, is imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life. During the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium \u2014 Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war breaks out as a result. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, the Xianzhou could not resist the invaders alone. All the prisoners in cryo-hibernation were released to counter the invasion \u2014 including the Reignbow. The Reignbow headed into the prison deep within the Xianzhou Zhuming to persuade the imprisoned Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, to help the Xianzhou fight off the Denizens of Abundance. They made a deal allowing the Flint Emperor to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents made the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xianzhou Xuling and the Xianzhou Fanghu. After the battle, the Reignbow Arbiter disappeared and the heliobi were imprisoned once again. The Flaming Emperor was gravely wounded and left behind part of their body. Since the hero and their followers perished, the deal made with the Flint Emperor for their bodies remained unfulfilled, and the heliobi hold this debt against the Xianzhou. In The Year 4800 of the Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Ardens Regia was bound to watch over the Primordial Flame on the Zhuming. Once, a delegation visited the Zhuming to to request arms and reinforcements for the Yaoqing's Crane Feather Orbit Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the Borisin. As they were escorted through the Flamedisk Forge Palace, they observed the Flint Emperor's light being sealed."}

The median age of natural death for Foxians is 307 years, making them relatively short-lived compared to the other species that inhabit the Xianzhou. Similar to canids, chocolate is toxic to Foxians and will make them sick should they consume it. During the vast majority of a Foxian's life, a large number of all-powerful stem cells are stored in numerous organs of their body. These all-powerful stem cells will continuously repair the physical body of Foxians, allowing aging and damage to be healed in a short period of time. Until a few years before their end of life, the number of these all-powerful stem cells gradually decreases, but still remains sufficient to maintain their ageless appearance. Between 250 to 450 years, the median age being 307 years, these all-powerful stem cells come to a complete halt and lose their ability to divide freely. What ensues is a death that comes with multiple organ failure. Natural death comes quickly, with patients often dying within 3 to 4 days after the all-powerful stem cells have lost their ability to divide. The good thing is that most Foxians are prepared for the various age-related diseases that begin to develop in their organs, so it is typically not too late to prepare for the aftermath. Although Foxians typically do not succumb to mara because of their shorter lifespans, they are still susceptible to it through unnatural means, such as the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus' medicinal pellets. Pheromones. Foxian pheromones can be used to create controllable illusions in Butterfly Immersia and is the base of Foxian magic, and Butterfly Immersia is even said to be a cultural relic of Xianzhou Foxians. Shapeshifting. The ability to shapeshift (known as \"Moon Madness\" by the borisin, whom they share a common ancestor with) has been observed very rarely in some Foxians, apart from the Foxians of the Yaoqing, who are said to be genetically similar to the borisin. Shapeshifting is accompanied by intense hyperplasia of the bone and muscle structure, such as a protruded snout and jawline, and the twisting in of the foot structure. Despite their phylogenetic relationship with borisins, when the entire liver of a Foxian is completely removed, there has never been a record of a Foxian turning into a \"cancerous mass\" as is the case with borisin. Foxian stem cells are not generated in the liver, but gather there for some reason, and their regeneration rate slows down if the liver is removed. The wingweaver Xili implied that the Zhuming Foxians look similar to borisin. A Foxian took pills from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and transformed into a werewolf before being apprehended by Xueyi. Culture. Customs. According to the Foxian \"birthfate\" custom of having babies \"picking\" their future, parents will put various objects and toys around an infant cub, and get them to choose their future career path by grabbing an item. If the child reaches for a jade abacus, it is said they will grow up to be a diviner. If they reach for a sword, they will grow up to be a famous warrior, and if they reach for a toy starskiff, they'll become a starskiff pilot. After completing a custom known as the Hairpin Ceremony, Foxians may be considered adults. People tend to hold a common belief that Foxians are naturals when it comes to business, though some people like Mengming say that business success results from practice rather than inborn talent. Most Foxian traders learn their skills by having their parents or superior leaving the business to them for a period of time as a test. They may ask someone they know to help out from behind the scenes and offer guidance. Foxians have antique folk statuette that are said to bring wealth if placed correctly. This may be similar to the real-life practice of . The Foxians of the Xianzhou Yaoqing are known for their adventuring flying families. The most renowned of these families was that of Baiheng's. Foxians from the Sky-Faring Commission have a tendency to refer to guests and clients as \"benefactors.\" Even though Foxians are also considered a long-life species, their lives span only around three centuries. Therefore, many of them are more passionate about enjoying the fun in life and chasing the best moments in life with all their heart and soul. Foxian soldiers have a ceremony where they place their dead in Starskiffs and then let them drift out into the stars, which is known as \"the Returning.\" This rite is similar to the soul-soothing ceremony for other Xianzhou inhabitants. Given their limited lifespans, the only ones who place value on such funerary ceremonies are Foxians. Paper kites are often gifted to children, but as a symbol of spreading one's wings and soaring high up into the sky, they are also a comfort to Foxian pilots. Foxians have an old tradition where paper kites are used to comfort the souls of pilots who can no longer fly, which is still carried on to this day. Music &amp; Entertainment. Foxian drum chanting is the youngest out of all the Xianzhou regional folk arts. Its origins can be traced back to the first Foxian merchants banging on pots and hawking goods out on the street, when Foxians first joined the Xianzhou Alliance. Performers strike drums while singing with the rhythm. It is almost exclusively a singing art, with almost no spoken word. Foxian drum chanting themes closely align with the ethnic characteristics of the Foxians, who praise heroes and romance while singing of passionate battles and ardent emotion. However, compared with the simplicity of Xianzhou Chordophone, Foxian drum chanters usually adopt serenely beautiful and boundlessly evocative lyrics. One of the earliest Foxian drum chanting songs is the Foxian traditional \"Epic of the Old Verdant Home.\" In recent years, two Foxian drum chants have become quite popular: The \"Cloud Knights Against the Borisin\" with its depiction of historical heroes, and the soft, joyful romance of \"Foxian Bewitched.\" Another one is \"Lament of the Six Follies\". Foxian epics tell how the Foxian and Borisin races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. Despite their common origin, later historical developments saw the borisin treat the Foxians as slaves or cannon fodder, fueling their desire to conquer the stars. Pacify Play is a traditional theater performance of the Yaoqing Foxians. The theater's stage is described as vast and circular. The most authentic and traditional \"Pacify Play\" on Baiheng Street is available at Red Fox Theater. They need a large stage to be able to showcase all elements of the play, as the Red Fox Theater is one of the few that rejects the use of special effects to preserve their millennium-old traditions. This type of traditional opera uses different types of facial makeup to differentiate the characters and their personalities, so it requires some prior knowledge to be able to understand the story. Still, it is said that most people should have no problem experiencing the charm of the play, as it boasts super-realistic stage combat scenes where dozens of actors will find themselves moving around in midair, or acting out gunfights and physical struggles. Politics. After the Foxians joined the Xianzhou Alliance, many of them who wished to rebuild their homeland, forming the Verdant Sect, which merged with the Homeward Sect. Till this day, they remain a political force to be reckoned with. From the merging of the two sects, it is observed that their style of faith stands as something akin to a slogan for the Homeward Sect, as well as the Verdant Sect. All they want is to be back in their homeland."}

Text. Amidst the cosmos' glittering stars, there lay a prosperous realm, the Old Verdant Home. Its lands were lush and the seasons fair, a scene beyond mortal ken and ordinary flair. Unexpected war struck with conquerors' greed, the borisin storm roiling the Old Verdant Home greatly indeed. Oceans of blood flew where'er canine barbarians went, Foxians wallowed and wailed, their homes buried and rent. Our people lamented midst bitter wind's chills, as they looked on their homes, tears covering the hills. Suppressing their sighs they mourned for this change, beseeching the gods to stop the borisin's rampage. The Foxians hid from the world, fleeting from war. And among them six brothers, wandering from day till nightfall. But cold and starved in the end they fell sick, twisted their fates, fortunes catastrophic. O'ercome by anguish they fell to their knees, wailing out lamentations that shook the mountains and sea. Their weeping echoes soared up to the skies, a celestial descended, heeding their cries. The brothers asked the celestial's name, and so the master with their staff did proclaim. The Master of Immortality am I, and asked: why, oh six, do you whimper and cry? Eldest brother cried for he feared the borisin's sharp blades, how their weapons could pierce and slaughter with rage. Second brother sobbed due to pain of disease, illness deep-rooted, a pain none could ease. Third brother lamented out of cowardice and fear, driven near witless by the too savage curs. Fourth brother weak and powerless was born, unable to run and with all hope forlorn. Fifth brother witnessed the slaughter of family and friends, the living enslaved, his heart torn a-rent. Sixth brother longed for peace to descend, that the war might conclude and all hatreds be spent. Master of Immortality with a compassionate gaze, heard out the six brothers as they laid out their pains. Brothers' cries ceaseless till all concerns vented, beseeching the Master for miracles granted. To dread not the blade, the brute, nor disease. To fear not the thief, the invader, nor fiend. To pass vales and crags as if t'were flat plains. To finally know peace, reft of anxiety or pain. To eldest brother, regeneration was granted. Second brother, to be free of disease, was enchanted. Third brother, gifted endless courage, confidence unmatched. Fourth brother, wings to grow on his back, to lift him away from threat of attack. Fifth brother, freed from all concerns, all anguish, all grief, and mortal yearns. Sixth brother only, for reasons unknown, no power was gifted, no revelation shown. Having bestowed many gifts of power and skill, the Master then left, and in their wake all was still. Leaving five brothers who all blessings had gained, and a sixth with no obvious gift to his name. Yet the Master did not forget the sixth's reward, for in time all would know he had not been ignored. As the borisin army attacked Foxian hills, and the five brothers unveiled divine power and skills. Using miraculous powers they drove back the foe, the great martial heroes bringing the borisin great woe. For their crushing victories, legends, the brothers became. As the dogs ceased their attacks, fearing even their names. But one day fate turned, with no forewarning given. In the blink of an eye, was hope killed, a plague risen. Eldest brother's wounds festered, rotting within. Second brother, free of ill health, spread disease to his kin. Third brother's mind, twisted and poisoned with hate. Fourth brother body co'ered with feathers like leaves coming awake. Fifth brother, all consciousness lost, sat immobile as stone. But the sixth was untouched, for no reason known. Alone the sixth brother raided the borisin bands, all elder brothers lost to the Plague Author's hands. With no hope of salvation and no gift of grace, the powerless brother only sought death's embrace. The borisin Warmuhtar smiled slyly at sixth brother's words, then waved and called for his personal guards. Sixth brother was untied, made to sit among erstwhile foes, as the Warmuhtar in plain speech explained to his woe. \"Granted the Merciful One's blessings were your brothers like we, champions of the Master of Immortality.\" \"In savage nature and cunning and even in form, you are like us, as a mirror informs.\" Shocked to his core in the words' revelation, he looked to the glass with much hesitation. The face that looked back was by cruelty twisted, blessed with canine ears and a snout that the Master had gifted. Lamentable. O how lamentable. For this is how... The six gained miracles against their wishes, living dreamlike away from calamity and strife. Obtaining the Merciful One's immortality by a chance meeting, only to be possessed by the Plague and losing much worse than a life. Do not dream of peace with Abominations of Abundance. Do not harbor any delusion of possible co-existence. Only when the Skybow has eliminated all demons and monsters, shall we ever see the arrival of eternal peace."}

Text. \"*These three pages alone do not form a coherent story, but it looks like these are pages that fell out of someone's diary.*\" Page 1 November 23, Tuesday The boys and I have been walking around in this underground place for a few days now. Every night before bed, I would think to myself that a vagrant's life is not easy. I always had a bad attitude towards the vagrants in town, but who would have thought that I would have started vagabonding about? Alas, such is the winds of change. That darned Fragmentum. Without it, I wouldn't have needed to move away from home. I hope I can have a shelter to sleep tonight. It's really cold away from town. November 24, Wednesday We arrived at the mining area of Boulder Town. The supervisor here didn't like us initially and wanted to chase us away, but eventually acquiesced to letting us stay in the mine shaft on the edge. There were people here when we moved in. I think they're another group of vagrants? Is this what pitying each other feels like? This is their shelter, but it used to be a safe house for miners to escape from mining accidents. Eventually this mine shaft was abandoned, and so vagrants took it up. It's disquieting to stay somewhere I don't belong, but beggars can't be choosers. As long as I have a shelter to stay in, I guess. November 26, Friday Day two of staying with this group of strangers. I'm starving, I have no strength, and it'd be useless for me to mine with the mining team. Besides, those people tend to discriminate the vagrants, saying we're doing more harm than good. I have never done anything shady. At most, I pick up trash to exchange for something to eat. Why would they look down on me? There is one nice guy in that team, though. Some guy called Steve wearing the same battered blue shirt every day. He talks to me, so I talk to him. He said the team found the motherlode, but some punks went and harassed them, trying to claim the place for their own. Page 2 November 30, Tuesday I don't make much picking up trash, so I started helping the mining team with some odd jobs. I was a craftsman after all, so repairing the machine is not out of my league. Somehow or other, I fit in. That Steve guy is pretty swell. He kept me busy for a bit and started asking for me to join them in their drinking session. I think maybe I'll be joining the team next. It's all for survival anyway, and at least this is a step up. I had a look at the vein they found. It's quite something, no wonder people want it for their own. December 2, Thursday Steve asked me if I would like to join their mining team, specifically to help them maintain the machinery. I said yes, as long as there's food. I'm very grateful to Steve. Unlike the others, he really takes care of me. Maybe later I'll save up a little to bring him for a meal in a nearby town together with those guys I traveled with. I heard there is a Goethe Grand Hotel in Boulder Town, and the owner's wife is a pretty good cook. Rumor has it that a miner's private shield stash got stolen. I reckon it was the gang of punks who did it, which sucks. Because of them, the mining team's attitude towards us has gotten worse these past two days. Page 3 December 5, Sunday Holy mackarel! I woke up to the sound of fighting between the gang and the mining team. I'd better keep hiding in this shelter. Apparently Wildfire was here and tried to mediate, but even they couldn't get the two sides to stop. In the end, a bunch of machines popped out to separate the two groups. I hope everyone was okay. I haven't gotten a chance to buy Steve dinner yet. Maybe I'll look for him when all this is over. December 10, Friday I have been looking for Steve for two days and he's nowhere to be found. Not a single soul from the mining team saw him. Where did he disappear to? What happened that day? I hear those Robots are supposed to protect humans. Oh no, has something bad happened? December 13, Monday I reckon Steve might not have gone to work that day and went elsewhere. Alas, what a dramatic turn of events. Now I really have no one. I finally made a new friend, and he's now missing. There's nothing else here for me. Might as well pack up and leave tomorrow. I wonder if I'll ever be able to meet Steve again."}

It causes the typical spawning of corrupted creatures and enemies, appearing as crystal like substances forming off the corrupted matter. Overview. The Fragmentum is the corrosion of Stellarons, causing the corruption of living beings, as seen in Cloud Knights on The Xianzhou Luofu, and the spawning of enemies. They also create the existence of things like the Caverns of Corrosion and the Calyx. The Fragmentum started spreading in 2147 AE and is still spreading presently in 2158 AE. Chunks of Fragmentum accumulated on a surface (such as walls and buildings) is called Fragmentum Corrosion, and is easily discerned by its black and gold colors. Fragmentum-created monsters generally have a habit of destroying human-made objects, though some Fragmentum monsters can be seen guarding them, and some have higher intellect than others. Monsters created by the Fragmentum tend to model themselves after the Stellaron's surroundings. While it is possible to use Fragmentum-contaminated items, doing so is ill-advised and can cause severe side effects. Those who die in Fragmentum-affected areas with particularly strong emotions can remain as Echoes, retaining some of the traits they had while living. These are generally more intelligent and can lead other Fragmentum monsters into battle. Story. Herta Space Station. Before the Trailblazer is revived by the power of a Stellaron, the Astral Express had already come to the conclusion that they want to deal with the Stellarons and their Fragmentum corruption. In the name of Akivili the nameless passengers of the express welcome aboard The Trailblazer and start their journey at Jarilo-VI, although not intentional they come to understand the situation on the frozen planet and work to contain the Stellaron on Jarilo-VI, and stop the subsequent Fragmentum corrosion. Parts of Fragmentum were found across the station during the Antimatter Legion invasion. Jarilo-VI. The presence of the Stellaron on Jarilo-VI caused the Eternal Freeze, resulting in Fragmentum spreading across the planet. To protect the Overworld, the Supreme Guardian and Architects sent civilians underground and sealed it off in order to protect them, leaving behind various automatons for their protection. Despite this, the Fragmentum was able to seep underground, resulting in several towns becoming abandoned due to the danger of the monsters. The people of Belobog have been fighting the Fragmentum for roughly 700 years on a losing scale. When The Nameless arrived on the planet, they were able to seal the Stellaron, stopping the Eternal Freeze and the Fragmentum from spreading as aggressively, though the Stellaron's long duration on the planet means that the Fragmentum is unlikely to disappear in the short-term. The Xianzhou Luofu. The presence of a Stellaron on the Xianzhou Luofu has caused the corruption of the ship, leading to the conclusion that a Stellaron does not need to be on a planet to cause corruption, turning Cloud Knights into mara-struck entities.

On the way there, she and her companion stopped on the planet Orkron, where they toasted marshmallows together. When preparing for her dive into IX, Frebass modified a compass her mother gave her on her fourteenth birthday. She removed its needle so that it might detect the energy of the Imaginary Tree instead of a magnetic field, such that she might be able to orient herself inside IX. She also soldered together a diving suit made of abandoned metal, used oxygen tanks, discarded gyroscopic devices, a self-circulating life support system, and other discarded materials. She also wore the diving helmet her father left behind, and a medallion she made for herself. The suit had lead boots designed to weigh her down and pull her further into the depths of IX. After 30 days of journeying with her companion, Frebass finally entered IX, fully prepared to never return. Inside of IX, Frebass relived her memories of her journey with her companion.

Description. Biology. While Clayforms can take on humanoid form and walk on two feet, their bodies can actually stretch and take on any shape. For example, while up in the air, they can stretch themselves into a pancake-like form to catch more air and eventually safely land on the ground. They can use mimicry to imitate the form of other species and even somewhat replicate their physiology and tactile sensations. For example, when mimicking a Pepeshi, they are able to feel the pleasant and intimate sensation of touching the \"fluff ball\" on their head. The Clayforms' greatest weakness is that they dissolve upon contact with water. Culture. The Clayforms on Kalsas are ruled by a monarchy under a Clay King and Clay Queen. Audiences are held in the Royal Council Chamber of the Claymen. According to the King, on Kalsas, anyone can speak their mind. Wet weather rainy season is considered a hazard and calamity among the Claymen as they dissolve upon contact with water. The Interastral Peace Corporation introduced a variety of technologies to the Clayforms such as rain shelters and the Disposable Kinetic Cannon. Clayforms rely on IPC services for interstellar travel, and it costs them a significant amount of credits just to clean the decks. History. Sometime in the past, a rare-earth management consultant from the IPC, along with a Synesthesia Interpreter, was invited to speak on the stage at the Royal Council Chamber of the Claymen. Their true goal was to obtain precious minerals from the Claymen and have them join the IPC. The Synesthesia Interpreter assured the Claymen that they would defend Kalsas from the calamity that was the wet season. Bored and frustrated, the consultant mocked the Claymen language and claimed that the planet didn't have a shred of hope, because the Claymen wouldn't make it past the wet season. The Synesthesia Interpreter smoothed things over by interpreting that there was so much hope for Kalsas and by joining the IPC, there would be no communication barriers. Afterward, the IPC constructed rain shelters on the planet. As a result, disappearances during rainfall became few and far between."}

The chances of getting a Relic with a particular Main Stat appears to vary. (For example, there are four possible Main Stat possibilities for feet Relics.

Once there are 4 sub-stats, every 3 levels will instead enhance a random, already existing, sub-stat. This means that a 5-star relic with 4 initial sub-stats will be able to enhance its sub-stats up to 5 times, due to its max level being +15 and it enhancing a sub-stat every 3 levels. Likewise, a 3-star relic with 1 initial sub-stat will be unable to enhance any of its sub-stats, due to its max level being +9 and it adding a sub-stat every 3 levels. Furthermore, a Relic cannot generate duplicate sub-stats or ones which are the same type as the Main Stat.

Monday, March 20th Objectively speaking, people like me are novelists in the purest sense. I don't write for money. I write whatever comes to mind. Everything I've seen and all my experiences from traveling are reflected in my novels. If it wasn't for family, I really wouldn't be helping out at the cafe. Tuesday, March 21st The customers today were basically all young couples. There was one curious pair. The man was yakking on to the woman about his history of \"starting a business from scratch.\" It was so awkward, but the lady seemed to enjoy it. I stood in front of the counter and listened in for a long time until my back hurt. I was trying to look for some inspiration, but there was laughably none to be found. Friday, March 24th Two times in a row, it was the lady who paid the bill. And judging from their clothes, she was rich, and he wasn't. While the nature of love does not discriminate based on wealth, the \"rich girl, poor guy\" trope is excellent writing material. A rich but innocent girl meets a poor loaf with an ulterior motive. Love takes root from the seed of lies. \"She was immersed in this fantasy, completely ignoring the falsehood it concealed. This may be the first time in her youth that someone is willing to talk to her so patiently. Her fantasy and thirst for love, and the shackles of her family that bind her have now come so closely together. Even though they have only met twice in the cafe, she is already at a loss, completely absorbed this great white bliss. So much so that she would not doubt that this was all an elaborate ruse. Because up till now, no one else has even had the thought of deceiving her. Not to mention, deception also costs precious time.\" Sunday, March 26th The couple came to the cafe for the third time, and the man named \"Bill\" brought the girl some papers \u2014 documents to invest her family's wealth in. The poor girl, who has never seen the dark side of the human heart, does not know how to refuse, and is played like a fiddle by the cunning loaf. \"The investment document incessantly tugs at her shame, a constant reminder that the love she longs so dearly for can never overcome a certain line. Faced with such a sudden advancement, she is struck to the bone with nervousness. All she could muster were a few shy nods, unable to refuse anything. Even though she grew up in a generous environment, she never expected the tolerance and goodwill of society.\" The novel's outline is complete and I estimate that I should be able to finish it in a month or two. Monday, April 3rd Some Silvermane Guards came and said that the Fragmentum's corrosion will soon spread to Backwater Pass, and that I should tell the cafe owner to prepare to move. It's a pity that I've only recently started to like the life at the cafe. I love the feeling of carefully grinding coffee beans and meticulously brewing, only to come up with a bitter lump of paste. Ironic and helpless, just like most people's lives. Tuesday, April 4th The couple hasn't been here for almost a week. Maybe it's because the transport hub has been closed to traffic. That \"Love is tragedy\" is something everyone knows. So, let's end the new book with a tragedy. Wednesday, April 5th The couple actually came today. They didn't order coffee, just a cup of hot water. The woman cried a lot. It seemed that her father had cut her off after knowing about them, and now she can't even afford to eat. Bill gave her some money to stay at a hotel for a few days before going back to make amends with her father. This Bill is no novice. He's playing the long game. Friday, April 7th The surrounding shops are almost all done moving. After cleaning up, I had to go to the Plaza's Management Office to go through the procedures of ending the rent. I didn't expect to see Bill there. The guy was crying to the people at the Management Office about how he was cheated by the young lady of the developer's house. But the people at the Management Office said that the girl named \"Lavonne\" was just a real estate agent. She wasn't the boss's daughter. Ha? Wouldn't you know? Truth really is stranger than fiction. Sunday, April 9th There is still a box of candy, and four boxes of outdoor furniture that have not been removed. Despite all his tiredness, my uncle can still be so stingy. Why didn't he ask for help? He just had to come by himself. Oops, I realized I haven't bound my manuscripts yet. Hopefully nothing gets left behind."}

It was written by Pela. Text. \"*The date on the letter is too blurry to read*\" Dear Captain: I, Silvermane Guards Intelligence Officer, Pelageya Sergeyevna, hereby report on the situation within the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone in the last thirty days and offer any recommendations where appropriate. Thirty-five soldiers from the troops stationed in the restricted zones had died and fourteen became MIA in the past thirty days. An additional 178 soldiers were assigned to reserve squads away from the front lines due to various degrees of injury and have been sent to the field hospital in the restricted zone for treatment, unable to return to the front lines in the near future. As of now, both the Direwolf Battalion and the Snowmole Battalion under the Amber Brigade are unable to maintain formations. The relevant units have been re-organized as follows: The Snowmole Battalion has been dissolved and all former Snowmole Battalion members have been absorbed into the Direwolf Battalion. The former lieutenant colonel of the Snowmole Battalion had voluntarily resigned from their position and now acts as the logistics manager of the Direwolf Battalion. The Direwolf Battalion will retain its current designation and remain within the Amber Brigade. Due to the aforementioned reasons, our defense lines now have insufficient troops in the northeast and need reinforcements. As we do not have enough human soldiers at the present, I recommend each battalion of the automaton brigade to send over some units to compensate for this lack of fighters. Moreover, the morale of our troops has slipped significantly due to continuous losses and severe injury. Multiple battalions have voiced their displeasure \u2014 Not towards you as the captain, but towards Supreme Guardian Cocolia. Looking back over the previous engagements, it is evident that we only suffered severe losses whenever the Supreme Guardian overstepped her role and gave out direct commands. With all due respect, I understand that the Supreme Guardian is desirous of victory, but we must never leave our defensive lines and directly engage with the Fragmentum creatures. Not only does this go against the calculated outcomes of the Ovtchaporov Dynamic Combat Formula, it is also a denial to the army's years of combat experience. In order to quell the complaints within the army, reduce our losses, and preserve our strength as much as possible, please negotiate with the Supreme Guardian and reclaim the command of the Silvermane Guards. At the very minimum, please don't let her issue ludicrous commands such as \"Silvermane Gunners, move forward by 20 meters.\" Pelageya Sergeyevna"}

Text. 39, 51, 2157 AE, Lyrid Meteor Shower Ha, this may sound strange, but imagine a Herta Space Station researcher who's spent a lot of time in space being fearful of zero-gravity. It's been five hours and I can still clearly feel the sensation of the traction cable tightly wrapped around my upper body. Even though I am aware that the cable is made from a rare lithium fluoride that can't be damaged by even the sharpest blade, I still imagine myself being unbound and slowly floating into space. After all, the universe is vast and there is definitely a place for everyone. What's the point of staying on the space station and being constantly humiliated? Maybe I would be lucky enough to be intercepted by the Celestial Comet Wall while floating through the darkness and board the jingling mine cart of the shepherds to travel amongst the stars. But it is also possible that I would fall right through the cracks of the cosmos into the great abyss of the Leviathan like a mayfly into the mouth of a giant whale. Are their insides warm, dark, and moist? Or is it like the gentle starry night sky as the Nameless describes it to be? If it's the latter, I would at least be able to witness such magnificent sight before my death. It'd be better than staying here and being treated like garbage. Anyways, it really doesn't matter where I die. No one would care anyway. \"Beep \u2014 beep \u2014 balance confirmation complete.\" Red lights flash inside the Balance Cabin. The noises notify me that the inspection mission has been completed and that the power balance of the protective field is intact. Dying in the mouth of the great abyss is just my blabbering. Right now, I need to lean on the control station and make some formal recordings, I'm sure the terrible handwriting wouldn't be an issue. Perhaps I shouldn't waste the firsthand information and try to complete the anti-gravity protective field research report as soon as I can to make up for the undesired results of the previous research and regain some of my self-evaluation points. Or maybe I should go and find Wen Tianweng in the repair room for a beverage to relax my nerves. I can then be honest with myself and admit my distaste for writing research reports. Through the porthole, I can see the faint blue-violet lights of the anti-gravity protective field dispersed across the universe. It has been around for a total of eight Amber Eras... It is hard to imagine anyone other than the IPC being able to put together something with the ability to withstand such a long period of time. Was its original conception praise for Madam Herta or was it a prophecy against an unknown danger? Or was it both? It didn't matter, because soon the monsters will be arriving, and they will throw themselves at the space station more frequently than they have in the past. The mutations they will send will also be more horrifying. They've been kept in the Research Cabin for the past era and living as phantoms in the rumors that spread across the space station. But now, being in the frontlines, it is very likely I will encounter them eventually. This isn't exactly bad news. In fact, it makes me excited. Information regarding the Legion has always been monopolized by the elite researchers. It would be much more interesting to observe the space station's most prominent enemy up close than inspecting and repairing ionization balance, and researching for ways to upgrade the defenses. Why would upgrading defenses be something a researcher like me should be worrying about? Does the IPC only make the defenses and offer no after-sales services? Leaving the task of ultimate survival to the researcher with the lowest evaluation score in an era doesn't make sense at all. I suspect that this is just a trap and that there is a subtext to it: Once a researcher fails, he should go and do some physical labor to prove what value they have remaining. Although I have no interest in this topic, I have to produce a decent research report or I'll have to continue my stare down with it in the next era. It's a spectacular form of cyclical punishment. I actually don't really understand why everything has a score. Obviously, someone's say only a bottom-feeder and failure like me would question the logical nature of a point system. All the researchers line up to enter the Scoring Room on the same day of every Amber Era, allowing the space station to inspect us in the name of Erudition. Like pigs for the slaughter on an assembly line, we are branded with elite, average, or inferior scores. For the purpose of receiving a higher score, topics that are less popular, more esoteric, or have a longer reporting period are deserted by the researchers, while the number of research topics that are for flattery and show increase by the day. I understood something when I look at the researchers pursuing that artificial score: We are not being blessed by the Erudition, but exploited by it. It can easily control this crowd of intelligent minds, placing their unrestrained ingenuity in one specific location, thus annihilating all possibilities for them to think freely. I can't help but think about the situation on my home planet, the one marked Xin-41 on the Hosea Star Map. Back then, I was such a genius, and with so much energy. When I first showed the potential to take the test, my childhood companions were no different from the shallow researchers at the space station. They had surrounded and cheered for me, just like how the researchers are now celebrating the \"heroes\" researching the Legion. They had prayed that I would one day take them away from Xin-41, that one day I would show the residents of Xin-41 what life is like in cosmic regions outside of the colonized area. They've once dreamed of a different life, one that doesn't include wasting their entire lives harvesting hallucinogenic spices to sustain the Slinkan species' supposed dreams of immortality. I, too, only found out after arriving at the space station that the Slinkans aren't the rulers of the cosmos. On the contrary, compared to the supreme existences in this cosmos, the Slinkans are really not that different from the residents of Xin-41. If the residents of Xin-41 were brave enough, they should revolt at all costs against the weak social control the Slinkans have over them. But they can't, because they lack both knowledge and courage. Although I've overcome my lack of knowledge regarding these oppressive situations, the cowardice bred from the impoverished soil on Xin-41 has been etched deep into my bones. That is why I remained silent when I received my single-digit score due to those unpredictable spiritual organisms. I received the gaze of the \"Skynet\" in the Scoring Room to just as I had bathed under the acid rain of my home planet. I was burning up, I was humiliated, I was full of hatred \u2014 and I was silent. However, it's proven that even the feeling of awkwardness is excess. There is only one benefit in splitting people into different grades outside of the space station, the convenience of feeling superior over others. It is worse here, however. The researchers have no need for something like a sense of superiority. All their hard work is for the purpose of gaining Madam Herta's attention and acknowledgment. They walk past me as if I'm just a harmless ghost. That's right, there have always been harmless ghosts wandering around aimlessly in silence here. It's just that by the time I became able and willing to notice them, I too have become one of them. I still haven't found the courage to tell my real situation to my family in the distant homeland. I don't want them to know that the genius of Xin-41, whom they had such high hopes for, is nothing but an inferior-grade pig in the space station they gaze upon day and night. Eikura Shuu"}

Director Martin's Latest Work \"Roadside Picnic\" Raises Heated Discussion With Its Convoluted Plot at the Theater Media Night Author: Olsen, Journalist for \"Belobog Weekly\" It has only been three days since the opening of \"Roadside Picnic\", the latest work of the Golden Theater Drama Department, and it already created heated discussion throughout Belobog. The Director of this play is Martin, the Silver-Haired Martin famous for directing \"The Belobog Wedding\" and \"Gone Guest\". As a five-times winner of the Goliards Award for Best Direction in a Play, he chose a brand-new genre to direct this time \u2014 the fantasy genre. Director Martin took the time to have an interview with us on the media premiere night for \"Roadside Picnic.\" \"I used to direct romance and intrigue stories, but those stories won't satisfy my ambitions anymore.\" Martin has a detailed plan for his future career. His latest work, the fantasy play \"Roadside Picnic,\" is twice as long as his prior works, giving him more than enough space to showcase his skills. Martin has his unique aesthetics in selecting stories. In the past, his award-winning works were all adapted from real-life events. However, his latest work, \"Roadside Picnic,\" is a completely imagined story. He is also no longer choosing playwrights with a background in media and journalism. Surprisingly, the playwright for \"Roadside Picnic\" is a \"newcomer\" who is writing for the stage for the first time \u2014 Marjorie, the literary master famous throughout Belobog. It is no coincidence that this literary master wrote the play \u2014 Marjorie is known for authoring sharp and bizarre stories, and Martin had always thought her stories are well-suited for the stage. However, Marjorie was initially busy finding materials for her new book and had refused Martin's first few invitations. With the help of Louise, the show's producer, director Martin finally moved Marjorie with his well-prepared concept design documents. Marjorie voluntarily delayed plans for her new book and left some free time specifically for this theater project. Although the show seems like a fantasy story fit for the whole family, the amount of twists it contains far exceed the audience's expectations due to the cross-disciplinary collaboration between two masters. On the surface, this is a story between the mole kingdoms and a human family. However, the show is very fast-paced and a large amount of detail is hidden on the stage. If the audience loses track of the pacing for even a moment, it becomes hard to grasp the mysteries and answers hidden in the stage backdrop, the spoken lines, and even in the lighting design. The plot of \"Roadside Picnic\" brings endless thinking for adults and acts as a brain-twister for children. The Belobog citizens hail this play as a \"Brain-Twister Masterpiece.\" The wise could extrapolate from the details and absorb the implications behind every little reference, while the innocent delight in the endless creativity behind the story. \"This story offers a brand-new view for us to examine our own lives.\" That was how Martin, the show's director and five-time winner of the Goliards Awards for Best Direction in a Play, replied to these praises and comments. Faced with eager journalists on the media night, Silver-Haired Martin only gave out a small amount of useful information. These vague snippets can only be completely understood after viewing \"Roadside Picnic\" in its entirety. All this is one big surprise that Martin and Marjorie had prepared for us this year.

Rye Bread Soda Iceberg At the beginning of the Eternal Freeze, many migrants thought there wouldn't be a need for cold snacks in Belobog. But soon, they couldn't resist the frozen delight. Belobog's central heating warmed every room of every household, and the heat made the air dry. Who wouldn't want to eat a frozen delight after a hearty steaming meal? Eating that frozen delight indoors will hit all the right spots. Eating it outdoors? Well, that's a whole other sensation! One of the traditional flavors from Belobog is rye bread soda. Rye bread soda is almost as old as Belobog itself. In 73 AF, the Belobog food committee, not wanting excess bread to go to waste, suggested an idea to several bakeries to create another product with them. First, the excess bread was turned to rusks, completely crushed, and soaked. Then, the bread liquid was extracted and fermented. The result was rye bread soda. It can be considered a product of Belobog's absolute resourcefulness. It's been proclaimed as an iconic drink that even children can enjoy. In recent years, there is a new rye bread soda on the market, called rye bread soda iceberg, based on the original rye bread soda formula. This new version is quite popular among young people. It is common to see young couples outside a dessert shop eating an iceberg with small spoons. Rye bread soda iceberg is easy to make and the ingredients are simple. Let's learn how to make it at home! Rye Bread Soda Iceberg Ingredients Rye Bread Soda: 800 ml Moo-Moo Yogurt: 330 ml (one bottle) Sugar: 10 g Steps to Make Rye Bread Soda Iceberg 1. Pour the rye bread soda into an airtight bag and leave it outside overnight to freeze completely. 2. Use tools such as an ice shaver to shave the iced soda onto the plate and form an iceberg. 3. Pour the Moo-Moo Yogurt into a bowl and stir with sugar. At this stage, you can add as much different jams of your liking to the mixture. 4. Pour the mixture from the top of your dark iceberg to form a sweet and sour silvery, silky layer, and you're done! Tips 1. Feel free to replace the rye bread soda with any other sweet beverage. It will taste the best with rye bread soda though! 2. Please finish the iceberg as soon as possible if you are indoors. If you're worried about it melting too fast, you can add small amounts of well-cooked animal collagen to the mixture. You won't have this problem if you eat it outdoors!"}

Text. \"*This is a page cut out from the \"Voyager\" magazine.*\" Keeping up with fishing partiesHow about some juicy frostweave salmon bread Author: Lila The lake in the Belobog suburbs may be frozen solid, but hidden beneath the surface is a powerful undercurrent. That's right! It's the undercurrent caused by a large amount of frostweave salmon in search of a spawning ground! It is also the time of year that they are the fattest, because they stock up the energy and nutrients to prepare for the swim upstream, during which they are unable to feed. The Belobog fishing teams head out to prepare for the seasonal hunts. Through efficient and large-scale hunting, the city's frostweave salmon reserves are plentiful. Of course, the proximity of the hunting ground to Belobog means the cruel and extreme temperature and climate have their risks. Such a grand scale of fishing can only be read through the articles. But, starting this year, you can also be a part of the fishing parties! Three years ago, Belobog approved the \"Fishing and Hunting Co-Op Program.\" After a two-year trial run, they're finally ready to open up registrations. As one of the members who participated in the trial run, I will be starting a new column, \"Fishing and Hunting Co-Op,\" in the \"Voyager\". The column will cover travel preparation, delicious foods, and various activities, as well as aspects of the co-op program that may require special attention. As the saying goes, \"the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.\" For the first issue, we will be focusing on the unique delicacy, frostweave salmon bread. Everyone knows that the frostweave salmon we get in the city has been processed to prolong preservation. After the head and guts are removed, the salmon is salted and dried. This process brings out the flavor that we are so familiar with. However, the salmon at the reserves taste even better. The frostweave salmon will freeze quickly out of the water. It can be said that you can't get salmon any fresher than this. The most traditional frostweave salmon dish, which is highly recommended by the head chef of the fishing parties, is the frostweave salmon bread. It is simple to make, so here are the steps: \u2022 You will need to have sliced your bread beforehand. It will take a lot of effort to cut it in this cold climate.\u2022 You will also need to prepare the redsunset jam beforehand. Cut the redsunset into pieces along with various berries, then stir with seasoning. Be sure to store it in a thermal container, or you will have to melt the jam with hot water, which will be difficult.\u2022 Cut the frostweave salmon into slices. You can ask the chefs from the fishing team to help with this step. Next, you will need to peel off the skin, then place the fish meat and jam onto the bread. And there you have it, an authentic serving of frostweave salmon bread. As you may have noticed, the most troublesome ingredient of the recipe is the fresh frostweave salmon, which may be hard to come by in Belobog. You'll find plenty of it at the fishing reserves though. The salmon's freshness and the jam's acidity produce a smooth texture that will have you salivating within seconds. The tenderness of the fish, with a lighter fish stench and more fatty meat, is different from the dry salmon that we're used to. It is truly unforgettable and definitely worth a trip to the reserves. Of course, the fishing parties have a minimum amount of salmon that they must catch before tourist activities can begin. Rest assured, there's plenty of frostweave salmon to go around. The co-op program will only require a one-time fee. In other words, tourists who participate are free to eat as much as they want within the fishing reserves. Next time, we'll be taking a look at how to stay warm in the frigid cold. Stay tuned, avid travelers. This is Lila and I'll see you in the next issue."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6678","text":"Salsotto Salsotto is a ruined and abandoned planet devoid of life, mentioned several times in \"\". Its history is mentioned in the Planar Ornament set Inert Salsotto and the Relic Set Eagle of Twilight Line. Description. Planet Salsotto as a whole, due to its vast seas of sand, was said to have shined in the most dazzling shade of gold, with its giant meteorite craters clearly visible. This was due to the impact caused by the Meteoric Starfall relentlessly hitting the planet at such a particular angle which caused the planet's rotation to gradually come to a halt. This caused Salsotto's days and nights to last half a year each, causing daytime to be scorching hot and nights to be extremely cold. The Salsottians boarded two floating mobile cities, one of which was named Tumbleweed, which had to move constantly along the terminator line between dawn and dusk in order to survive. Salsottians developed winged suits and many became skyfishers, where they would hunt the phlogiston jellyfish for their livelihood, as it was an essential component to the Phase Flame that powered and moved the city. Skyfishers had to take care to not get attacked by giant birds though. Culture. The pursuit of \"Tumbleweed\" was not only for survival but also for a dignified life. When it moved faster than the terminator line, then the early morning light would march into the afternoon; when slower than the terminator line, then the dusk light would fade into the late night. In this way, the naturally optimistic Salsottian managed to restore every day to its original state. The romance in their bloodline blessed them with the easygoing spirit to sing leisurely in peaceful afternoons and sleep soundly on starry nights. In the morning, skyfishers departed from the port and dove right for the sand, where they would hunt the phlogiston jellyfish. They would only return to the city after dusk. By the power of mysterious creatures, the city barely managed to voyage ahead. Even though their entire survival relied squarely on those two fragile wings, the Salsottians were optimistic by nature and would never let the heavy burden of fate lower their spirit or bend their spine. They would find time to spend with their family playing glass musical instruments, with such an attitude that it was almost as if they could carve the musical notes right into the glass. They also enjoyed making pen pals and would often place their written messages in the Dandelion Letterbox, meant for the moving city on the other end of the terminator line. It was no easy feat for Salsotto's skyfishers to entrap and hunt phlogiston jellyfish that flew out of the sand. During turbulent flights, the seemingly tender and soft safety harness was the thread of life for a skyfisher. Hunting phlogiston jellyfish was never easy. From trick moves to intense chasing, from precise blocking to the final capturing act, one wrong move in any one of these links in the chain could mean mortal danger. It was customary for a young skyfisher to get one strand of hair from each parent and weave them into the harness with metal supports, while a married one should get one from their spouse. In this manner, the harness would be blessed by the power of \"home\" and ensure that the skyfisher always returned safely. In this cruel world where all fought hard for survival, \"home\" was the only place that could offer comfort and support for a skyfisher. Hunting phlogiston jellyfish was a long survival game for skyfishers from Salsotto. Legs, being far from the heart, can only maintain their temperature when tightly strapped in fluffy feather puttees. Only at the end of the long and highly stressful hunt would an exhausted skyfisher begin to feel pain and fatigue. For those unprepared, it would be too late to discover their partial necrosis caused by severe frostbite. Therefore, skyfishers would check if they had tightened their puttees many times before taking off. After all, they wouldn't get another chance to do so in high-speed flight. They knew what the wind would take away as they stepped into the sky. Traces of lime powder and aluminum powder were found in the metal shell embedded in the puttee, which seemed to be a means of emergency heating. If any skyfishers died from exhaustion or were attacked by giant birds, Salsottians would spare no effort in bringing back their remains and would bury their winged suits and eagle helmets with them in the dark land. According to the traditional Salsottian rituals, \"landing\" equals death and is a symbol of eternal rest. The flight must never stop, just like how the city must never stop moving. Only the most skilled, respected, and reliable skyfisher captains would receive a Soaring Ring. They blew their fishing whistles in the sky and seamlessly coordinated with one another, like they were the most sharp-eyed hunting eagles. For the duration of each flight, each team member was lonely and vulnerable. All they could rely on were the 124 types of whistles that could be performed by their team captain. Hence, there had long been a saying in Salsotto \u2014 \"Skyfishers entrusted one-third of their lives to the rigorously developed technology, one-third to their ingeniously refined equipment, and one-third to their reliable lead skyfisher captain.\" History. Past. At some point in the past, waves upon waves of strange meteorites ceaselessly fell onto Planet Salsotto. The long-lasting impact caused by the Meteoric Starfall relentlessly hitting the planet at such a particular angle caused the planet's rotation to gradually come to a halt. Salsotto's days and nights became longer and longer, until every sunrise and sunset would last for a seeming eternity, and the whole planet's rotation was finally brought to a standstill. The day night cycle lasted for half a year each, causing daytime to be scorching hot and nights to be extremely cold. This was why the Salsottian people, barely surviving at the time, boarded two floating mobile cities and began their chase with dawn and dusk, moving along Salsotto's Terminator line, which was the Salsottians' lifeline for habitability. However, this voyage of tenacity and perseverance would, at last, come to its final downfall. Gradually, the planet's magnetic field weakened and the atmosphere thinned and years later, the two moving cities that had never met each other would fought against each other in an unknown conflict, with their respective turrets among the wreckage still aimed in opposition. One of the two cities must have crossed half of the planet to the other one and started the initial incursion. Traces of brutal warfare between the two cities were still occasionally discernible under the sand dunes, which together, became practically the same ruins. Ever since a certain unknown time, the duration of each of its rotation cycles had somehow gradually decreased, but the ruins of the once mobile city still lie silently on the planet, no longer following the ever-shifting terminator line. Recent History. Many years ago, Himeko and Pom-Pom received a mission from Herta to seek out Cadence Glass, a material found on Salsotto. When they arrived before the planet, they found a shipwrecked vessel containing Welt and his unnamed blonde companion.

If viewed from a cosmic perspective, Planet Salsotto as a whole, due to its vast seas of sand, shined in the most dazzling shade of gold, with its giant meteorite craters clearly visible. At a certain fateful moment, waves upon waves of strange meteorites ceaselessly fell onto Planet Salsotto. The long-lasting impact caused by the Meteoric Starfall relentlessly hitting the planet at such a particular angle caused the planet's rotation to gradually come to a halt. It was like pushing a world-deactivate button. Salsotto's days and nights became longer and longer, until every sunrise and sunset would last for a seeming eternity, until nobody could take it any longer, until the whole planet's rotation was finally brought to a standstill... It had become a fact of life that sizzling summers under the scorching sun and dark nights of bitter coldness would last for half a year. What was left of the whole Salsotto were the last two remaining cities that were moving non-stop, always running right after the terminator line. The colossal fortress was floating in the air like a gargantuan raincloud, slowly hovering across the sky above the golden desert with thundering noise. Wherever it went, overwhelming storms of sand were cascading down and over. In the giant moving city, the Salsottians in winged suits were flying up and down among the city's buildings. These flying folks who had survived the calamity by sheer luck now belonged to the sky and were bound to it at the same time. In the morning, skyfishers departed from the port and dove right for the sand, where they would hunt the phlogiston jellyfish. They would only return to the city after dusk. By the power of mysterious creatures, the city barely managed to voyage ahead. Even though their entire survival relied squarely on those two fragile wings, the Salsottians were optimistic by nature and would never let the heavy burden of fate lower their spirit or bend their spine. They would find time to spend with their family playing glass musical instruments, with such an attitude that it was almost as if they could carve the musical notes right into the glass. They also enjoyed making pen pals and would often place their written messages in the Dandelion Letterbox, meant for the moving city on the other end of the terminator line. Gradually, the planet's magnetic field weakened and the atmosphere thinned. In the face of a fated doom, the sparkles of life were not yet snuffed out, and the eagles would never cease to fly."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2180","text":"Salsotto's Terminator Line Salsotto's Terminator Line is a Relic piece in the set Inert Salsotto. Description. Ever since the stagnation caused by the Meteoric Starfall, the terminator line had become the lifeline of the Salsottians. When it all started, people still took the shifting of day and night for granted. The line of dawn and dusk swept across the earth, climbed over mountains and ravines, brought dawn to those still awake, and sent sunset to those who would soon sleep... But when the rhythm of light and darkness slowed down, day and night were no longer familiar, and the seemingly eternal heat and coldness were like the quagmire of hell, slowly burying all lives entrapped within. This was why the Salsottian people, barely surviving at the time, boarded the floating mobile city and began their chase with dawn and dusk. Climbing atop the observation deck of the mobile city of Tumbleweed and looking in the direction that they were moving, daylight lies ahead and dark night behind. The pursuit of \"Tumbleweed\" is not only for survival but also for a dignified life. When it moved faster than the terminator line, then the early morning light would march into the afternoon; when slower than the terminator line, then the dusk light would fade into the late night. In this way, the naturally optimistic Salsottian managed to restore every day to its original state. The romance in their bloodline blessed them with the easygoing spirit to sing leisurely in peaceful afternoons and sleep soundly on starry nights. However, this voyage of tenacity and perseverance would, at last, come to its final downfall, and the ruins of the once mobile city were eventually left far behind by the ever-shifting terminator line. Years later, the two moving cities that had never met each other would finally stand against each other, with their respective turrets among the wreckage still aimed in opposition. One of the two cities must have crossed half of the planet to the other one and started the initial incursion. Traces of brutal warfare between the two cities were still occasionally discernible under the sand dunes, which merged with unnameable hatred and morphed together into the same ruins. Planet Salsotto kept its silence. And ever since a certain unknown time, the duration of each of its rotation cycles had somehow gradually decreased, ushering in its own self-healing in an unpopulated future."}

Text. Your Excellency, I have been tasked by the Seat of Divine Foresight and the Ten-Lords Commission to re-compile and re-organize the archives of the Alchemy Commission, specifically focusing on the remaining records regarding the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus after Dan Shu's rebellion. During the tenure of the traitor, Master Primus Dan Shu, numerous covert biological experiments were already carried out within the Alchemy Commission. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus aimed to replicate fantastic creatures made by the celestials in previous millenia. These experimental creations closely resembled the military war beast documented in ancient records, both in terms of nomenclature and physical characteristics. However, there is one particular experiment that took place during the tenure of Dan Shu's predecessor, whose current whereabouts are unknown. All names of individuals involved have been erased due to the disappearance of the previous chief alchemist. Given the current uncertainties, and being unable to inquire the people involved regarding the purpose of the experiments, I have prepared a concise summary. The experiment involved the injection of Vidyadhara blood and marrow fluid into various species, including those with scales, feathers, fur, long-life volunteers already exhibiting signs of being mara-struck, some short-life species, and outworlder volunteers. The objective was to observe the reactions of these organisms in both their normal state and mara-struck state. The supplementary data is outlined here (For further details, kindly refer to the attached document.) \"Subject No. 4. Class Scaled, Genus Osteichthyes. On the day of injection, the subject exhibited molting of its existing scales, with the growth of a cuticle observed on the head. Secondary bone development occurred in the head, and noticeable enlargement of the mouthparts was observed. Hair growth was also observed near the dorsal fin and gills of the test subject...\" \"Subject No. 8. Class Furred, Subspecies Canis... On the following day, the subject displayed signs of mania, with gradual shedding of nails and teeth. However, the corresponding organs grew back even sharper on the subsequent day. Keratosis developed on the subject's neck and tail. The subject was killed and its body destroyed after attacking and wounding two alchemists...\" \"Subject No. 1-E. Class Feathered, berrypheasant. After being injected with \u2588 drops of marrow fluid, the subject experienced the shedding of feathers and its symbiotic berries within half a day. The subject's entire torso underwent stretching and elongation, while its head acquired characteristics resembling those of other creatures. An organ resembling a forelimb emerged from its chest. The subject was subsequently terminated...\" \"Subject No. 1-F. Class Furred species, yellow boulder oxen... Two days later, the subject's skin exhibited signs of mutation that resembled scales, joint reflexes were observed, a sarcoma developed on the forehead, and accelerated growth of horns and hooves took place. The subject was subsequently terminated...\" \"Subject No. 2-C. Xianzhou human. Long-life species. The subject already displayed early signs of being mara-struck, and both the family and the volunteer consented to participate in this experiment. Following the injection of marrow fluid, no significant relief from the mara was observed. However, it is worth noting that after the subject became fully mara-struck, the subject's self-consciousness remained with remarkable clarity compared to other mara-struck individuals. Their level of sanity was comparable to that of a normal person. Subsequently, the subject unilaterally believed themselves to have been cured and refused further \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and the Commission had to undertake necessary measures to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 the subject.\" \"Subject No. 4-B. Outworlder. Short-life species. The subject, in a short-life species' middle\/old age, willingly participated in the experiment after learning its purpose. After being injected with marrow fluid, the subject's cellular activity was activated, resulting in significant improvements in bodily functions. The original deteriorating body experienced revitalization, with restored vision, liver and kidney functions, and alleviation of pain caused by certain joint diseases. The subject exhibited no adverse reactions, except for localized scaling of the skin... ...However, an accident occurred during the experiment. After \u2588 weeks, the subject's body displayed reverse growth, regressing from a middle-aged state to a childlike form. The subject's mental faculties deteriorated significantly. Eventually, after \u2588\u2588, their body \u2588\u2588 liquified, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 temporarily recorded the conclusion of the experiment as 'having disappeared due to unknown reasons' in the report.\" \"Subject No. \u2588-\u2588. Short-life species, race \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The subject was deceased when delivered, and the body was donated posthumously for experimentation. We administered marrow fluid into the subject's body with the assistance of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The marrow fluid even exhibited a revitalizing effect on the deceased body, resulting in profuse hair growth and skin molting. Horn-like cuticula emerged on the head, indicating \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. However, the subject did not revive as anticipated. Instead, it seemed as though the physical body was unaware of the brain's demise and continued to proliferate in a disorderly manner. The presence of Vidyadhara bone marrow was so mighty even in a the deceased body... The test did not achieve \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 desired expectations. As a precaution, the subject was promptly terminated before \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\" Due to the content being damaged and space constraints, I will refrain from providing further elaboration on reports of a similar nature to the ones mentioned above. The remaining information primarily concerns dosage, injection timing, cycles, variations among experimental subjects, and related details. The aforementioned original reports have been enclosed with this letter. Furthermore, I would like to inquire whether it is the intention to investigate the original objectives of these experiments in order to conduct a comprehensive assessment of their risks? \u2588\u2588 of the Alchemy Commission"}

I watched this season's broadcast of the \"Interastral Tournament Festival\" on the Interastral Peace Network. Please do not misunderstand me, I have very little interest in the Aetherium Wars game itself. If it weren't for an old Stellaron Hunter friend of mine's persistence, I would not waste my precious time watching the festival.

Within a large number of civilizations, silicon-based structures exist solely as tools: I believe that this view is supported by the locals of your world also.

The society aims to repay Clara for her angelic deeds such as helping with the entire vagrant camp's food and lodgings, and healing our exhausted hearts and minds. Therefore, as adults, we should \u2014 not bring trouble to Clara; help Clara whenever we can; let Clara grow up happily; become Clara's true family; protect Clara's innocent smile; protect Clara's angelic voice; and protect Clara's heart of gold. Though Clara is not good at receiving any strong displays of gratitude and always lowered her head in embarrassment, we are not going to stop! What can you get out of joining this society? By joining this society, you can: 1. Enter the vagrant camp and share Clara's gentle smile that can melt snow with the society's millions of members (there is no completed member headcount, but trust me, that's how many people are protecting Clara). 2. After Clara had greeted you, hide in a corner and vocalize your praises at a volume that does not disturb her. 3.

Question Clara on matters aside from daily life in the vagrant camp (it should be basic manners not to pry into other people's privacy). 3.

SoulGlad BombSource: Auslotte of Bloodhound, Golden HourClassification: A terrorist attack with a fantasy overtoneSummary:There are rumors about a Dreamchaser who depleted their family's fortune in the Dreamscape but refused to leave peacefully. They then devised a potent popping candy using Pika White Grape Soda and \"Sour Dreams\" Soft Candy. By storing this special candy in SoulGlad bottles, they produced a large quantity of SoulGlad bombs.Their intention was to trigger explosions when Bubble Hounds jostled the bottles and mixed the two during transportation, causing widespread chaos in the city.However, their plan ultimately backfired due to the Dreamchaser's proximity and closeness with the Bubble Hounds. It is said the volatile explosion from dozens of SoulGlad bombs caused a severe concussion, leaving the Dreamchaser in a coma to this day. Memes in DreamscapeSource: Dreamweaver Colleen, Dream's EdgeClassification: Memetic monsters within DreamscapeSummary:Penacony has recently experienced a series of disappearances. Investigations have revealed that the bodies of the missing individuals remain intact in the dreampools of the hotel, but their consciousness is lost and cannot be awakened by any external means in reality.According to the informant, these individuals were abducted by a monster known as \"memes,\" which appeared seemingly out of nowhere. The victims were taken from various Dreamscape Moments, were of diverse races, and exhibited a variety of different behavioral patterns before their disappearance. The monster's motives and modus operandi remain shrouded in mystery.Moreover, all witnesses' memories have been erased by The Family, impeding further investigation. Corrupted Dream TickerSource: Woolsey of Bloodhound, hotel in the DreamscapeClassification: Corrupted objects in the DreamscapeSummary:The Sweet Dreams Troupe in Penacony has recently suffered a series of attacks. The attacked Dreamscape creations not only suffered significant physical damage to their shells but also underwent a profound corruption of their consciousness.At each crime scene, a bizarre tape was discovered, believed to be the source of the corruption. Exposure to the tape is believed to induce excessive irritability, fear, and even hallucinations. Prolonged exposure can lead to a complete mental disintegration. Additionally, the presence of the tape has the ability to distort the Dreamscape itself. Devil's GateSource: Dreamchaser \"W,\" hotel in the DreamscapeClassification: Unidentified mysterious powerSummary:According to the informant, there is an impassable pathway within the collapsed section of the hotel in the DreamscapeThe space and time in that section exhibits an eerie state. It cannot be described but can be sensed.\"I looked at the end... but there was no end... and I saw an entity that couldn't be seen...\"\"...I can only hear inaudible chants in the absolute silence...\" Claudia's Gathered Clues (II). Haunted CorridorSource: Anderson, a Drinksmith at the hotel in realityClassification: A corridor where ancient ghosts appearSummary:I obtained this rumor from Anderson, the Drinksmith, in exchange for a special drink.In Penaconian history, there was once a lineage called the Blackplum Family that met their demise in a war with the Alfalfas. According to records, a fierce frontal battle took place in the connecting corridor of the ring-shaped prison area, resulting in devastating casualties due to the small size of the area. The battlefield is now named the Corridor of Eternal Rest.According to Anderson, as the prison was transformed into a hotel, fragments of the corridor became scattered throughout the Dreamscape during the process of dreamweaving. Even today, under specific conditions, visitors can still \"sense\" the bloodshed when they approach those fragmented corridors.*Note: I heard a similar ghost story from a friend of mine from Xianzhou. In their culture, such phenomena are referred to as \"Netherworld Soldiers.\" Memetic HunterSource: Adelyn, a journalist from the Moment of ScorchsandClassification: Dreamchasers that transformed into monstersSummary:Historical records reveal that during the initial Pioneering Era, the Primordial Dreamscape was plagued by numerous dangers, including soul-devouring dream rifts and countless meme monsters.Back then, dreamchasers from distant planets ventured into the desolate plains to hunt and destroy the formidable monsters. However, even with the support and protection of the power of Harmony, many dreamchasers succumbed to memetic contamination, gradually transforming into gruesome monsters and remaining forever in the Dreamscape.Some accounts suggest that the Bloodhound Family once captured a peculiar memetic creature that exhibited a non-aggressive and even friendly demeanor towards humans. Over time, the captured creature weakened and eventually perished, potentially supporting this rumor. The Wrath of HarmonySource: Brina, an usher of the Dewlight PavilionClassification: The Descent of the Eternal CenturionSummary:Legend has it that when The Family first arrived at Penacony, the notorious Antimatter Legion once coveted the planet.In response, The Family held a special Charmony Festival, summoning not the Harmonious Choir, but the wrathful Eternal Centurion.Their Sword of Bounded Lives, unsheathed from the scabbard of 4,630,000 Hounds, formed an infinite rainbow. By the time the people in Penacony raised their heads from their shelter, the countless Voidrangers had been swallowed up into the iridescent colors.Since then, the forces of Destruction have never dared to step onto the Planet of Festivities. Dream BorderSource: George, a Dreamweaver at Penacony Grand TheaterClassification: Composition of the DreamscapeSummary: According to George, the sweet dream known as the Twelve Hours represents only a fraction of Penacony's Dreamscape. \"...It's merely the tip of the iceberg. In the depths of the Dreamscape, there remains a vast unexplored wilderness... rough and rustic, closer to the true essence of dreams...\"Furthermore, the construction of those \"artificial sweet dreams\" has given rise to \"concentrated mini-nightmares\" that attach themselves to the edges of sweet dreams. The Family uses them as \"dumping stations\" to collect and eradicate negative emotions.These nightmares can inflict irreversible damage on human minds. However, The Family has been taking meticulous measures to isolate those areas beyond the ranges of human activity."}

Chapter 1As the first light of dawn breaks through, Clockie is awakened by the sound of clanging metal. Groggily, he opens his eyes and draws the curtains, his mind still heavy with sleep. Outside, a flurry of origami birds scrambles in the air as a shower of stones cascades down from the sky like rain. \"Chirp, Clockie, Clockie! You're finally awake! Come out, come out. We need your help with something important.\"\"Tick-tock, but if I step outside, those stones will definitely smash my head.\"\" Nope, you silly! Those stones are us repairing the houses. You're my dear friend, Clockie, and my stones will only smash Boss Stone's head.\" Boss Stone. The very mention of the name brings a sudden clarity to Clockie's sleepy mind.The stones used to construct Dreamville are actually the most precious gems in the world. Origami birds carefully collected them from the desert and forest to construct the town, the home of their friends, piece by piece. That's why Boss Stone constantly brings lots of baddies here to rob the birds of their precious gems and wreak havoc in the town. Clockie steps out of the door cautiously. Just as the origami bird said, all the stones fall around the house, avoiding his dial. \"Tick-tock, the clever and brave Clockie is coming, my friends! I can resolve any trouble that comes our way.\"\"Oh, clever Clockie, the stones in Dreamville have almost run out.\"\"And if we don't find more stones soon, we'll have to live in dilapidated houses.\" Clockie realizes the gravity of the situation. Living in crumbling dwellings would mean rain can soak into his dial, and he would definitely rust! But the birds are struggling to find more stones when they are flying so high already. How is Clockie supposed to find these stones? \"I know of a place, Clockie.\" The one who speaks is Captain Revolver, Clockie's dear friend and an old crew member of The Compass. This courageous and formidable hero has helped Clockie out of trouble countless times. With a head shaped like a giant revolver with an old cowboy hat sitting on it, he always instilled fear into the hearts of baddies. \"Remember the caves in the forest? Those dark tunnels connect countless towns and forests.\"\"Tick-tock. I get you, Captain.\" The caves hold countless treasures and innumerable dangers, but with Captain Revolver leading the way, Clockie feels no fear. The Captain's aim is always true, and with a single shot, he can vanquish any foe. Together, they will find a new forest, bring back stones, and Dreamville will become even more beautiful. However, a new challenge soon emerges, causing Clockie's hour hand to twitch in frustration. \"Tick-tock, but the caves are too dark. How are we supposed to find our way through?\"\"Don't worry, Clockie. The tunnels are home to many luminous butterflies. They're all my friends. Time waits for no one. Let's embark on this adventure right now, just like the old days.\"\"Yeah, let's go!\" Captain Revolver, known for his fiery temperament, leads the way with brisk strides. That's why he's always leading the group, with a few origami birds trailing behind him. These clever helpers know exactly which stones will be suitable for the town. The still-drowsy Clockie walks at a leisurely pace, bringing up the rear of the group. This is how our intrepid band of adventurers embark on their journey. Part 2. Chapter 2\"Hey, long time no see, Captain Revolver! Tell me more tales about your adventures on the sea!\"\"Whoa! You must be Clockie, right? Glad to meet you!\"\"Origami birds! I heard you've eaten up all the fruits belonging to Missy Fruit Tree. You won't eat us, right?\" Just as they step into the tunnel, the butterflies start to chat incessantly. Their delicate wings flutter and flap, illuminating the path ahead in blinking lights. Clockie cannot help but marvel at how lovely these new friends are. The complicated tunnels resemble a giant labyrinth. Even the butterflies only dare to live near the entrance. But, with Captain Revolver taking the lead, they have found the courage to venture deeper. \"Tick-tock, how spacious it is here! If only Dreamville could be as grand.\"\"Once we discover a new forest, not even a hundred tunnels like this can compare to our town.\" \"A town as large as a hundred tunnels like this? That would be massive.\" Clockie cannot even imagine what it would look like. \"Tick-tock. Captain, aren't you afraid when exploring such tunnels?\"\"Haha! This kind of danger is just a walk in the park. It doesn't hold a candle to our adventure in the Amethyst Forest. Back then, you jumped into Piano Spider's web, and Mirror Princess was so scared.\"\"Tick-tock. Piano Spider is a true gentleman. I still remember the cake he gave us before we left.\" The mention of a new story from Clockie piques the origami birds' curiosity, and they clamor for Clockie to tell them more stories. Clockie promises to share his stories one by one once they return to Dreamville, as he has too many to recount at the moment. Even with the assistance of their butterfly friends, traversing such treacherous tunnels required immense bravery. However, as everyone witnesses Captain Revolver and Clockie's banters, their fears subside. That is precisely what Captain Revolver intended. He is more than just a hot-tempered pistol: His mind is sharp and resourceful. Whenever his companions feel uneasy or encounter difficulties, he will somehow find a way to cheer them up. Under his leadership, the silent tunnel has turned into a place filled with laughter and joy, going from a place of terror to a locale full of fun. However, the perils within the tunnels remain, undeterred by their bravery. Soon, a sense of unease begins to creep up on the butterflies. \"Captain, we just heard a buzzing sound. It wasn't like the fluttering of butterflies or the chirping of birds.\" The tunnels are home to a myriad of creatures, some friendly, but most are not. Since their friends often make sounds like \"whoa,\" \"chirp,\" or \"tick-tock\", Captain Revolver realizes that the creatures lurking in the darkness are definitively fearsome villains. \"Keep it down, everyone. We need to make haste.\" Captain Revolver's words carry authority, and even the mischievous Clockie covers his clock hands on his nose to minimize the noise. As the team advances deeper and deeper, the tunnels grow quieter. Everyone tries to be as silent as possible and focus on the road ahead, their ears hearing only the faint sound of butterfly wings fluttering. Captain Revolver, shielding his friends, leads the way with extreme caution. However, in the lightless dark, the horrors eventually quietly close in. Silently, greedily, swiftly. Part 3. Chapter 3Just as the group advances with caution, a pitch-dark figure is already hiding deep in the channel. It hid in the soil, preparing to ambush and devour Clockie as he passed by. However, the ever-vigilant Captain Revolver is one step ahead. Before the creature can even strike, one of his bullets already pierces through its nose. \"It's an Old Buzzfly! Watch out!\" Without giving the Old Buzzfly a chance to react, another fiery blast erupts from Captain Revolver's head. A mournful cry follows from ahead. Soon, a deathly silence falls over the entire tunnel once more. \"Tick-tock. Thank you, Captain. Without you, I'd have become its meal.\"\"Don't get relaxed yet. Old Buzzflies never hunt alone. There must be more of its companions lurking inside the tunnels.\" As if on cue, soon, the tunnel is filled with a cacophony of buzzing sounds. Old Buzzflies are a bunch of non-vocal monsters, but far more terrifying than any ordinary foes. They will devour everything in their path. Soon, everyone realizes the terrifying truth \u2014 these Old Buzzflies have already devoured the forest on the other side of the tunnel, and are now headed towards Dreamville itself! \"We've got to stop them passing through here!\" However, the tunnel is so dark that not even a glimpse of the Old Buzzflies can be seen. How are they supposed to defeat those monsters? Just as Clockie's gears are about to get stuck in exasperation, brilliance suddenly illuminates the tunnel. \"We've come to help you, Captain.\" The butterflies flutter their wings vigorously, the shining dust of the scales shimmering like stars as they fall into the tunnel, exposing the repulsive Old Buzzflies and giving them no shade to hide. Captain Revolver expertly pulls the trigger with this light, the muzzle on his head almost spitting flame. One after another, butterflies who have exhausted their phosphoric dust fall to the ground, only to be replaced by fresh reinforcements. \"We can't keep up like this. Clockie, my friends, leave now. I'll manage those Old Buzzflies myself.\"\"But...\"\"No 'but.' I'm Captain Revolver. I won't lose to the likes of them.\" Seizing an opportunity while Captain Revolver is momentarily distracted, an Old Buzzfly lunges toward him, aiming to vanquish the most valiant opponent present. However, the butterflies form a delicate barrier, their wings breaking in the clash as the phosphorus powder blinds the Old Buzzflies. Amidst the unceasing sound of gunfire, Clockie and the origami birds flee desperately until exhaustion overtakes them. They could not take one more step or make one more wing flip. Finally, the familiar sight of the forest and Dreamville re-emerges before them. When Clockie leads his companions back to the tunnel, the battle has long concluded. Scattered phosphoric scales adorn every corner, illuminating the tunnel even brighter than daylight. The radiant glow guides them forward through the corpses of one Old Buzzfly after another and out of the cave. The Old Buzzflies have devoured everything \u2014 except the stones here. \"Tick-tock. Captain? Butterflies? Are you there?\" There is no reply. With the stones, the shattered town is repaired. However, Captain Revolver and the butterflies never return. Sometimes, sunlight filters through the cracks in the tunnel, illuminating the fading phosphorus powders. Those sparkling colors always make Clockie feel as though someone is trying to talk to him. \"Hey, Clockie! Let's go on another adventure!\""}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34612","text":"Clockie and Mirror Princess Clockie and Mirror Princess is a readable series found on Penacony. Text. Part 1. Chapter 1A sharp knock resounded outside Clockie's abode. He dressed himself as usual and bounced in his steps as he went to open the door. Five Origami Birds chirped and flapped their wings outside, piquing Clockie's curiosity. \"Tick-tock, good morning, everyone! Oh, but what's that mist?\"\"Chirp, Clockie, Clockie, the mist from the desert has swallowed our home.\" That was terrible! It was the dreaded mist from the Nightmare Desert, concealing an invisible monster that has devoured many unfortunate souls, although whether the monster eats clocks remains unknown. The birds bravely ventured into the Nightmare Desert to get stones to construct Dreamville. The most remarkable stones lay deep within the desert's heart, yet no bird dared to venture there. Clockie's hands anxiously spinned in a circular motion. Tick-tock, he heard the monster's mocking laughter. \"Tell me your name, monster!\"\"Haha, Clockie, my name is 'Unknown.' With my two pairs of eyes and two mouths, I shall swallow all of Dreamville, and none shall escape my clutches.\" The monster soared through the mists happily, toppling roofs one moment and causing sandstorms the next. Nobody could stand against it. Indeed, this monster was so fearsome that even a cactus would shed its needles in horror at the mere mention of its name. Once again, Dreamville was in the throes of a dire crisis. \"Ka-ching! If this continues, Dreamville will become Nightmareville!\" Captain Revolver exclaimed. However, as the town's guardian, he also had no idea as to how to defeat Unknown, an intangible monster.\"Tick-tock, indeed, we must find a way to defeat it.\"\"But how, Clockie? That Unknown is so powerful that it fears neither my bullets nor your clockwork!\" ...\"I know what it fears most.\"A melodious voice resonated, reminiscent of a song even more beautiful than the birds' a capella. The voice was gentle and exquisite, akin to that of a princess. Adorned with an elegant gown, the lady, with her head being a delicate mirror, gracefully bowed before everyone.She was Miss Mirror, Clockie's good friend once upon a time \u2014 She was once the princess of the Mirror Kingdom, and everyone called her the Mirror Princess. \"Tick-tock, are you not afraid of that monster, Mirror Princess?\"\"Of course not, my friend. That monster is called 'Unknown,' and its greatest fear lies in being known. Once my mirror reflects its hideous visage, it will no longer remain 'Unknown.'\" With those words, Mirror Princess confidently approached the laughing mist. Her mirror emitted a faint light akin to a sword piercing the monster's eyes. Gradually, the mist dissipated, and the arrogant monster let out a wail. \"No, no, no! Don't let me see that! Mark my words, you nuisances! I shall return again and devour you all!\" The monster let out a shriek and fled, and the town was restored. Clockie and Captain Revolver threw a grand celebration in honor of Mirror Princess. The townspeople danced with joy, singing songs and praising her courage, and baking the most tasty cakes for her. \"Even if that monster will return, don't worry, Clockie! Let's keep the momentum and get rid of that villain once and for all!\" A wonderful idea! Once they defeat the villain, the birds will be able to find stones and branches from the heart of the desert, making Dreamville even more splendid! In the meantime, Unknown was hiding in its lair, making malicious whirring cries. Realizing that the princess of the Mirror Kingdom was its nemesis, it was trying to figure out a way to take her down...Since Unknown was a nefarious villain, it soon came up with an idea, and it was the most malicious plan imaginable. Part 2. Chapter 2Clockie and his party followed closely behind Mirror Princess. Wherever the mirror shone, the dreadful mist would dissipate. As they advanced, Clockie spoke with Mirror Princess about their shared past, of how they got to know each other during a journey.\"Tick-tock, do you remember your Mirror Kingdom, princess? It's so fun there! Everyone is a mirror!\"\"Yeah, mirrors of all shapes \u2014 round, square, star-shaped, and others. And I happen to be the most esteemed kind, the round-shaped mirror. That's why when you arrived there, I mistook you for the 'Mirror Prince'!\" Amidst laughter, Clockie thought back to the beauty of the Mirror Kingdom, and the days he spent traveling alongside Mirror Princess and Captain Revolver. They had explored countless enchanting places, but none could compare to Dreamville as it is now. Clockie believed that with the aid of his friends, together they could turn Dreamville into the best place in the world. ...Suddenly, sinister laughter pierced through the silence of the desert. \"Hahaha! This isn't Dreamville, but the Nightmare Desert! And I'm the king of all nightmares!\" Clockie was certain that he had never heard a voice so malevolent before. Even a notorious arch-villain like Boss Stone paled in comparison to such vileness. The voice seemed to be both distant and near, but whenever Mirror Princess's radiance illuminated their surroundings, the voice would shriek and retreat in haste. They continued moving forward, their steps echoing endlessly, until it seemed as if the desert-enveloping mists had dissipated. A whole new world was revealed to them. However, Clockie soon realized that the vast expanse of the desert managed to deceive his senses. It was not until dusk that they finally arrived at a place engulfed by dense fog. \"This must be that monster's lair.\" Mirror Princess stepped forward bravely, and with each stride, the mist receded in reluctance. But then a sudden alarm echoed in Clockie's mind. \"Tick-tock! Stop there, Mirror Princess! It's a trap!\" Too late! His warning was in vain. Beneath the mist, the Unknown laid a long rope on the ground concealed by the mist and tripped Mirror Princess's foot. With a resounding crash, she tumbled to the ground, shattering into countless shards. At that moment, the mist resurged, and the malevolent and satisfied laughter from the Unknown once again swallowed the entire desert. \"Ka-ching! What should we do, Clockie? Mirror Princess has been shattered!\"\"Chirp, what should we do, Clockie? The monster will devour us all!\" \"Fear not, my friends. It's not the time to cry. Please gather my shattered pieces.\" The desert resonated with a gentle, familiar voice. As everyone collected the scattered shards of the princess, they cascaded vibrant auroras amidst the golden sands. The shattered mirror pieces were everywhere, and each reflected the visage of the monster \u2014 a short, clownish, and craven ghost. The \"Unknown\" was deprived of its power and vanished forever, its final curtain accompanied by a wail of anguish. However, having fulfilled her purpose, Mirror Princess could not even utter her final words. The Origami Birds discarded all their stones and Captain Revolver spat out all his bullets. Together with Clockie, they meticulously gathered the shards of the princess \u2014 the sole remaining treasure she left behind. Despite her shattered form, Mirror Princess continued to guard Dreamville with her radiant glow. Whenever the mist returned bringing new monsters with it, the mirror would show their forms, continuing on to this day. With the arrival of a new day, Clockie swung open the door to his house, revealing the mirror they had meticulously reconstructed, peacefully resting in the garden of Dreamville. \"Tick-tock. Good morning, Mirror Princess. Today's another beautiful day.\""}

Having been corrupted by the Stellaron on Jarilo-VI, Cocolia plotted to destroy Belobog in the belief that doing so would allow her to create a new world, but was defeated by the Trailblazer and died after the Fragmentum energy of the Stellaron overwhelmed her. Cocolia is the antagonist of the Belobog Trailblaze Missions. Profile. History. Cocolia was born in Belobog, the artificial city created by Alisa Rand, her ancestor. She grew up in the Underworld, and after being selected as heir to the guardianship and moving to the Overworld, she would often visit the florist to see flowers she couldn't see in the Underworld. As a teenager, Cocolia studied at Belobog Military Academy with a major in military history, where she met and befriended a young Serval. She graduated top of her class and was said to be the most brilliant mind in all of Belobog. After becoming the Supreme Guardian, she also adopted a young Bronya from an orphanage in the Underworld. During her term in office, young Cocolia was tormented by the calls of the Stellaron in her planet, Jarilo-VI, which gave her premonitions of destruction and devastation that would come to pass unless she cooperated with its wishes to destroy the planet in order to rebuild it in her image. At least 10 years before the Astral Express crew arrive on Jarilo-VI, Cocolia decided to block off all access to the Underworld, leaving only the Geomarrow transport line as a means of connection. The mental damage Cocolia suffered from the Stellaron constantly tormenting her with promises of a better future became too much for her to handle, shaking her will and faith in the Preservation. This made her lose hope that Belobog would ever become prosperous, which led her to worship the Stellaron instead. Cocolia became disillusioned, distant, and very far from what Serval described her young self as, a person who was passionate about what she did and loved her home to the point that she'd sacrifice her own dreams for the sake of making it better.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5734","text":"Codex of Apocrypha Codex of Apocrypha is a readable that can be purchased aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. Beasts: Yellow Boulder. Yellow Boulder [Other Names] Also known as Stone Calf, Sleepstone, and Eight-Hundred-Miles. [Appearance] Has ossicones, with a short tail, lustrous fur, and stony texture. [Behavior] The animal has a mild temperament and hibernates in the mountains during cold seasons. It consumes large amounts of wild grass and fruits before winter, and its meat is the most tender and plump at that season. It then turns into rock and hibernates in mountainous valleys, during which its meat has absolutely no taste. It is therefore a precious food ingredient dependent on the seasons. [Legend] There was once a Xianzhou man who raised cattle in a faraway delve. Calm and peaceful, he spent years away from home. His brother went looking for him, and they had an emotional reunion. He told his brother that a sumptuous banquet was prepared, but there was no food \u2014 only a valley strewn with stones. The brother was surprised, and the herdsman yelled, \"Rise, cattle!\" And all the yellow boulders within miles transformed into herds of plump cattle. [Flavor] Beef: Sweet, warming, and non-toxic. Milk: Sweet, cooling, and non-toxic. Horn: Bitter, warming, and non-toxic. [Effects] Beef: Nourishes the spleen and stomach, strengthens muscle and bone. Milk: Calms the mind, nourishes the stomach and lungs. Horn: Stops bleeding and treats diarrhea. [Recommended Recipe] Three Rocky Delicacies: Also known as Stone Soup. Remove skin and sinew from a few pieces of yellow boulder neck meat and ribs, place into a copper pot, then immerse with a few dozen liters of morning dew from Scalegorge Waterscape. Wash and slice black forest mushroom and rocky bamboo shoots, add to the pot, then bring to a boil on medium heat. This dish dispels cold and dampness, and warms the digestive organs. \"Note:\" \"Investigations show the person raising cattle in that distant delve should have been one of the Alchemy Commission masters. They are skilled at transmigrating animals, so the legend should represent a demonstration of biological transmigration.\" Beasts: Tuskpir. Tuskpir [Other Names] Also known as Dreaming Noble, Eternal Peace, and Sacred Branch. [Appearance] Elongated proboscis, no horns, speckled fur like the sky dotted with stars. [Behavior] A migratory beast, it lives in hot springs, valleys, and other places with geothermal heat. It is a timid animal by nature. Its proboscis is used to filter feed on aquatic insects and small fish like a whale would. [Legend] Spring waters where the tuskpirs live often have a soothing and meditative effect. The water breaths and creates a spiritual aura. In the olden days, the Luofu people used to grind down the animal's horns into medicine, calling it Spirit-Soothe Powder. It is often used to treat insomnia due to anxiety or depression. [Flavor] Meat: Spicy, warming, and non-toxic. Horn: Bitter, cooling, and non-toxic. [Effects] Meat: Quenches thirst, replenishes blood, and soothes the organs. Horn: Relieves pain by activating qi. Relieves asthma by soothing qi. [Recommended Recipes] Sacred Branch: Taskpir horn is actually a clump of feces. Poachers nowadays deliberately classify it into grades, making ridiculous assessments for different feces patterns and types just to pump up prices. In my opinion, the sacred branch could be used as ornaments or burnt as incense. Once burned, they calm the mind. Do not ingest orally. Spirit-Soothe Powder: Made from pulverized tuskpir horn, plus other ingredients. Rich in minerals but toxic if overdosed. \"Note:\" \"The Realm-Keeping Commission has verified that the tuskpir horn is no longer in any modern medicine, and its hallucinatory effect appears identical to that of intoxication.\" Beasts: Gentle Halcyon. Gentle Halcyon [Other Names] Also known as Puffergoat, Floating Ram, and Heaven's Mutton [Appearance] Curled horns, no tail, soft and fluffy coat. [Behavior] A species that lives in flocks and has a gentle demeanor. Shaped like a fluff ball, this animal inhales air into an internal air sac when in danger, inflating its whole body to float upward away from predators. They fly up in large groups, as if they are sightseers. [Legend] The Xianzhou people raised this animal for its wool. As they live in flocks, keepers usually lasso the head sheep. We now know that leather from their skin is very elastic, and their air sac is strong and durable, making all parts of the animal useful for starskiff production. Gentle halcyons raised at the sky farms regulated by the Sky-Faring Commission live carefree lives. [Flavor] Mutton: Sweet, very warm, and non-toxic. Milk: Sweet, warming, and non-toxic. Horn: Salty, warming, and non-toxic. [Effects] Mutton: Good for the spleen, warming and cooling the internal organs. Milk: Warms the liver and lungs, nourishes weaker constitutions, and replenishes blood. Horn: Relieves fevers, clears the liver, and brightens the eyes. [Recommended Recipes] Lingering Sauce: Wash and carve the Puffergoat into small cubes and place into a casserole. Mash star leek, taro peppers, and ambrosial apricots together into a marinade for the mutton. Simmer over an open fire until the meat disintegrates. Add sliced sturgeon, then grind into a paste for a delicious condiment. Divinely Gifted Crimson Lamb: Use the Crimson Melodies wine from the Dragon Spring Brew distillery to cook the mutton. Marinate the mutton and roll it up tightly, then immerse it into the wine, using a Scalegorge stone to weigh it down. Allow the mutton to soak until the liquor has permeated into the bones, then cut the meat into slices as thin as paper. \"Note:\" \"The flock management techniques recorded are rather old-fashioned, and the lasso method has now been lost to the ages.\" Beasts: Downy Antler. Downy Antler [Other Names] Also known as Lady Antlers, Wandering Velvet, and Startled Deer. [Appearance] Their antlers appear as tree branches, blooming flowers in spring. They have a short tail, and a soft and fluffy coat. [Behavior] Downy antlers have a symbiotic relationship with a certain species of flowers, with said flowers growing out of their antlers and particularly dense clusters at the intersection of several branches. When chased by predators or otherwise startled, these clusters will burst apart, with flower petals scattering everywhere to confuse nearby enemies. [Legend] The Xianzhou people of the past sought flower petals for pouches carried closely on their persons. In the old days, scholars would set up spring banquets on skiffs, seeking downy antlers and chasing them in delves. The people would compose poetry and play music as they watch petals raining down. [Flavor] Venison: Sweet, warming, and non-toxic. Antlers: Sweet, warming, and non-toxic. Flowers: Bitter, cooling, and slightly toxic. [Effects] Venison: Good for the spleen, warms the kidneys and stomach. Antlers: Warms both liver and lungs, nourishes weak constitutions, and replenishes blood. Flowers: Clears excessive internal heat and moisture by inducing sweating. [Recommended Recipes] Golden Velvet Rice: Pluck blooming flower clusters from young downy antlers in early spring, selecting blooms with the most richly colored petals. Blanch in diviner grass soup with a pinch of salt. Add day-old purple rice, then steam together. Consuming this dish regularly can calm the mind and grant better eyesight, with the effects enhanced if cooked using waters from Scalegorge Waterscape. Blooming Pistil Soup: Cut flower buds from the clusters using a knife, dip them in wax and soak them in a pot of honey. Immerse the pot in the thermal springs of Scalegorge Waterscape in summer and watch the flowers bloom. Enjoy the wondrous aroma and sight! \"Note:\" \"Despite being an endangered species, its population remains stable under the tenure of the Realm-Keeping Commission.\""}

Given that numerous violations occur during every audition, we have compiled a list of prohibited behaviors that are considered severely inappropriate. This serves as a warning to emphasize the importance of adhering to the rules. 1. The Issah Brawl Incident. During the 20th Festivity Auditions, a participant named Issah experienced verbal attacks from the judges during his performance. Consequently, he abruptly left the stage and initiated a brawl with the judges. Furthermore, utilizing his talent for voice mimicry, Issah imitated the voices of the judges, provoking other participants and leading to a chaotic brawl involving almost 10 other infuriated contestants. They all showed their capacities and the disruption even extended into neighboring competition areas. The turmoil persisted for around half a system hour, during which three security personnel from the Bloodhound Family intervened to restore order but sustained injuries of varying degrees. Please note that if the judges display any inappropriate behaviors during the competition, it is crucial to promptly report it to the organizers instead of attempting to resolve the issue independently. 2. The Irksome Family Incident. During the 6th Festivity Auditions, an unidentified participant impersonated Fowler, the head of the Iris Family at the time. This individual made derogatory remarks during a live broadcast of the audition, including statements such as \"We shall rename ourselves the Irksome Family,\" \"Anyone who dislikes the Irksome Family lacks taste,\" and \"I'm the most irksome of all.\" These actions significantly damaged the reputation of the Iris Family. The impersonator left the scene before security Hounds arrived. The broadcast triggered a wave of parody among the Penaconian youth, with young people taking to the streets and chanting \"Irksome Family is the best of all!\" as a means of criticizing Fowler's conservative cultural beliefs. Please note that any form of role-playing, particularly parodies involving official members of The Family, IPC, and Xianzhou Alliance, is strictly prohibited. 3. The Airbag Cannonball Incident. During the 11th Festivity Auditions, a participant named Angus concealed eight highly compressed airbags within his clown suit as a promotional stunt for his company's fast food products. His plan was to leap into the air and release the safety valves to display the product's advertising slogan as the bags expand and fly off. However, during the performance, five of the airbags malfunctioned due to poor quality, and one of the remaining three leaked due to a sharp accessory on his clown suit. When the safety valves were activated, Angus was propelled into the SoulGlad bottle on site like a cannonball and became stuck in the bottleneck. By the time Agnus was freed, he was foaming at the mouth. Please note that unconventional attire is not encouraged. Any attire that violates the dress code must undergo inspection by the organizers before the wearer is allowed to enter the venue. 80. The Man-Eating Meme Incident. During the 32nd Festivity Auditions, a participant named Buzzy brought a meme disguised as a human onto the stage and announced a \"man-eating show\" to the audience during the live broadcast. Before the judges could intervene, the scene of the meme seemingly consuming Buzzy alive spread throughout Penacony via the live broadcast, leaving a lasting psychological impact on an entire generation of adolescents. Although Buzzy managed to escape from the meme's grasp by the end of the show, the incident had a significantly negative impact. The intense fear sparked by the man-eating show attracted an extremely dangerous Memory Zone Meme, and it was only through the intervention of Don Wyatt, the head of the Bloodhound Family, that the lethal entity was destroyed. Please note that it is strictly prohibited to bring Memory Zone Memes onto the stage. Neither wild nor domesticated memes are allowed to enter the venue."}

Text. \"The following is a review of the initial draft of the script for the movie\" Clockie: Scorchsand Adventure, \"themed around the Pioneering Era.\" In this script, the story revolves around Clockie and the inhabitants of Dreamville as they embark on a perilous journey to reclaim the paradise from the monster known as \"Dread King\" in order to pioneer in Dreamville's Scorchsand Wonderland. The script effectively blends elements from the Pioneering Era and the Clockie series, resulting in a captivating narrative and showcasing a high level of artistic quality. Particularly noteworthy is the impressive final scene where Clockie and the Pioneerist simultaneously hit the Dread King. It is highly recommended to retain this scene in the official version. However, this administration must remind Clock Studios that there are both virtuous companions and evil villains among the Dreamchasers. During the Pioneering Era, armed conflicts among Dreamchasers often jeopardized the safety of the town's residents, and the Bloodhound Family was devoted to maintaining law and order through their patrols. Regrettably, in this movie, the Dreamchasers are excessively glorified, incorrectly attributing some of The Family's accomplishments to them. This portrayal may be misleading. Furthermore, the depiction of the Dog Sheriff potentially alludes to the Bloodhound Family and raises concerns. Dog Sheriff is portrayed as a thuggish security officer, perpetuating a discriminatory stereotype. However, records available in the Moment of Sol suggest that the Bloodhound Family made substantial contributions during the pioneering effort in the barren dreamscapes, on par with the Dreamchasers. Frequent attribution of villainous roles to the Bloodhound Family could lead to audience resentment, tarnishing the Bloodhound Family's image and contradicting The Family's philosophy of Harmony. Therefore, it is recommended to revise the script accordingly. We suggest incorporating romantic scenes between the Dog Sheriff and the Pioneerist, replacing their conflicting stances with elements of romance. Recent market surveys indicate that audiences are highly interested in stories of relationships between characters. This approach not only enhances the commercial value of the movie but also conveys Penacony's shared values of harmonious tolerance and friendship. Lastly, we would like to bring to Clock Studios' attention that the role of Clockie has been diminished in recent \"Clockie\" movies, and in this script is even overshadowed by the Pioneerist. While we understand the strategic direction of Clock Studios in attempting to establish a new series, it is crucial to note that Clockie has always been the iconic image of your studio and even Penacony. Therefore, we recommend maintaining a balanced share of screen time between each character in your future productions. I look forward to your future creations. \u2014 The Iris Family, Dreamscape Film Regulation Administration"}

History This is an ancient prescription aimed at soothing excessive teeth growth in Xianzhou natives. In year 6652 of the Star Calendar, Baize, Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission, altered the two components of draconic liquorice and steadfast teeth, replacing them with extracts of cloud poria grown on the Yaoqing and rock salt crystals from Insumousu respectively. This medicine can effectively cure obstructed teeth growth (or approximately twenty years).

Once emotionally stable, the patient no longer needs to ingest this medicine. History: This prescription had existed before the formation of the Alliance. After signing a trade agreement for the first time with the IPC, the Alchemy Commission welcomed an academic exchange visit from the Intelligentsia Guild's Troops of the Learned, and the two parties exchanged information. The alchemist Muyan transplanted into medical herbs the chemical compounds that reduced psychological arousal in the original prescription, breeding this brand-new medical plant called \"calming-valerian.\" Clear-head flowing-meridian infusion is a must-have when warring against the borisin. After ingestion, this medicine helps the Cloud Knights to suppress the fear incited by the borisin's pheromones. From \"The Comprehensive Handbook of Exotic Knowledge \u2014 The IPC Volume\" Salvation and Rebirth Pellet Classification: Transfiguration Main indication: Increased wound healing speed and decreased pain during wound closing. Prescription: Sprout combination remedy 2 mace, Fallow Earth infusion 3 candareen, Slumbering Anesthetic 3 candareen. Dosage: Form into pellet and swallow once a day. Stop when the wound has healed. History: This prescription was developed during the era when the Ambrosial Arbor first started to grow. Its main ingredient is the sprouts of the Ambrosial Arbor. After the Reignbow destroyed the Ambrosial Arbor, the Alchemy Commission never stopped investigating the Arbor's remains and innovated to produce components that can be used as medicine. This medication is a must-have for the Cloud Knights during warfare. From \"Achievements in Alchemy\" Wind-Walking Arts Classification: Transfiguration Main indication: None. Prescription: Wingweaver bone marrow (the amount has been erased). Dosage: The user must possess altered flesh. Inject the wingweaver bone marrow using golden needles, wait for six hours for the conversion, the user will gain characteristics of wingweavers.

Prescription: Tian dong 1 mace, Bigger-Faster 6 mace, paradise di huang extracts 1 mace. Dosage: Make into a pellet and swallow. One pellet twice a day after food. History: This medication is still under clinical trial. If no results emerge after a year, consider this prescription invalid and abandoned. (Note: Bigger-Faster is a combination medication from various different plants. Though there are no toxic side effects, it is strictly forbidden to widely apply this medication before Lady Bailu confirms its efficacy. From Lady Bailu's words Injection of Past Life in Dreams Classification: Hatching Rebirth Main indication: Vidyadhara that ingest this after their hatching rebirth can remember their past life. Prescription: Powdered dragon scale coral 1 mace, extracts from dream-speaker flower fruits 1 mace 3 candareen, calming-valerian extracts 3 candareen, white-hair ivy extracts 2 candareen. Dosage: Inject using golden needle after concocting the infusion. Clinical evidence shows this prescription should be used within five years after hatching rebirth. The patient will be able to regain memories of their previous life via dreams. However, the quantity and level of clarity of these memories are unable to be controlled. History: According to Vidyadhara legends, this prescription was made by the alchemist Qinglu for their lover. Qinglu did not want their relationship to be over and wanted to continue it in their next reincarnation. This prescription goes against the cultural traditions and laws of the Vidyadhara. It should not be used except when the very survival of the Vidyadhara race is at risk. It is an offense against the laws of the Vidyadhara to use the injection of past life in dreams on a Vidyadhara against their will, through coercion, or by force. The offender will suffer the punishment of rebirth.

Written by Gunn Konolev Several significant things contributed to my unwavering motivation as a researcher in the early years of my career: my inherent curiosity, my view of justice untainted by reality, and the agony of being powerless in the face of the loss of my youth and my motherland. Because of these conflicting emotions, I've written lots of books about galactic justice, planetary history, and malevolent factions. In my works, I investigated the order of chaos and the future of the universe, and I once thought the past, present, and future of the galaxy were already within my grasp, until... that incident happened and revealed that I was only a researcher after all. When reality hit, I couldn't stop the powerful from destroying people's lives, nor could I save the helpless people who were dying. As a result, in the final years of my career, I ceased investigating justice. For people without power, justice is an overly lofty concept. I intend to undertake a secret experiment inside the space station at the end of my life. Lead Researcher Asta has agreed to my request. I'll try not to bother anyone with this experiment \u2014 I realize it's an unreasonable request, so here's my confession\u2014this experiment is only a minor substitute for my abandonment of justice, just to fulfill a small wish of mine."}

Text. Revered General, I am filled with awe upon hearing of your courageous exploits, risking life and conquering the giant demonic enemy. You, general, are the unwavering pillar of Luofu and the backbone of the Alliance. Any misfortune that befalls you would have dire consequences. Therefore, I implore you to prioritize your well-being and seek solace for recuperation. With the growth of the Ambrosial Arbor now halted, the Realm-Keeping Commission is committed to eradicating any remaining disturbances as per our duty. The recent calamity has affected various delves, including the Starskiff Haven, the Divination Commission, and the Artisanship Commission. Once we have thoroughly assessed the extent of the damage, we will collaborate with the Artisanship Commission to commence reconstruction work. Madam Yukong, the Sky-Faring Helm Master, has diligently enforced blockades and inspected our airspace for hidden dangers in the aftermath of the calamity, and I need not elaborate on her splendid efforts here. However, it is disconcerting to note that Tingyun has been replaced by an imposter, leading to unsettling rumors within the Commission. Moreover, rumors about the growth of the Ambrosial Arbor are bound to spread beyond the confines of Xianzhou with departing merchants, and we can anticipate an influx of Elixir Seekers in the near future, perhaps reaching another historical height. How many of them would be covert agents serving the Plagues Author? And how many would be ignorant individuals consumed by their blind desire for immortality? Their insatiable demands will undoubtedly sow the seeds of hidden turmoil. Master Diviner Fu Xuan of the Divination Commission has ventured to the frontline, leading troops to apprehend the Stellaron Hunters and accomplished great feats. However, it must be noted that Fu Xuan's temporary assumption of command over the Cloud Knights surpasses the bounds of propriety, as dictated by the regulations of the Six Charioteers. Once you, general, have regained your strength, I beseech you to resume your rightful position. During the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis, Lord Zhu Lun, the head of the Artisanship Commission, was absent on a visit to the Xianzhou Zhuming. Consequently, all matters pertaining to the Commission were overseen by the esteemed Master Artisan Gongshu. While he possesses great skill in craftsmanship, he lacks practicality and management acumen. Nonetheless, his unwavering dedication and courage in maintaining his post during the calamity are commendable. The situation within the Alchemy Commission is exceedingly complex. Due to reasons known to all, the position of the commission's head has remained vacant for an extended period. Currently, Chief Alchemist Yuluo is serving as the acting head. However, perceptive as you are, I believe you have already foreseen that once the situation stabilizes, the Alliance will appoint a new head for the Luofu, inevitably stirring up another storm. If we can make preparations in advance, we will be better equipped to navigate the impending tempest. Since the rebirth of the Arbor, the Alchemy Commission has lost the trust of the citizenry, with outworlders even developing a sarcastic proverb \"just like the Alchemy Commission\" to laugh at how Xianzhou has been blind to such treason. The Realm-Keeping Commission has issued numerous circulars emphasizing the expected conduct and hospitality of officials and ordinary members. At this critical moment, the Realm-Keeping Commission must focus on calming the situation and preventing any further escalation of tensions with visitors. Medicine is the cornerstone of people's livelihoods, and employing medical practices aligned with Reignbow's revelations to aid outworlders in overcoming their ailments is a crucial aspect of combating the Plagues Author. In my humble opinion, rebuilding trust in the Alchemy Commission among civilians must be our foremost priority. To this end, I shall actively seek assistance from all other commissions. Please accept my apologies for any disturbance caused by my letter. I sincerely wish you a swift recovery, general. Huifu, Realm-Keeping Commissioner"}

After answering a total of 50 questions, players unlock a test report corresponding to an Astral Express Navigator based on the player's responses. Explorer of the Stars. &lt;br&gt; You are an idealist who is responsible and focused on self-improvement.You believe that everything should be regulated, and you adhere to your own standards.Because nothing in the world seems satisfactory, individuals aspire to improve themselves. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, Himeko, AKA the \"Explorer of the Stars,\" and you belong to the same category. Himeko was only a teenager when she encountered the stranded Astral Express.At that time, the Astral Express that once roamed the Cosmos had been missing for a very long time.The Express presented her a scenery of the magnificent universe \u2014 a space with dazzling stars and endless worlds...After years of hard work, Himeko finally repaired the Express and began her journey.Along the way, she witnessed countless wonders and traveled in the company of many travelers she met unexpectedly, building the Crew that we see today.Perhaps the Cosmos isn't perfect, but she's willing to lend a helping hand to every kindred spirit out there and set out on the road to the dream\u2026 Light-Chasing Guileless. &lt;br&gt; You are a generous person who is empathetic and affable.You are always passionate about addressing the needs of others, and people find it easy to confide in you about their thoughts and concerns.Selflessness is your duty, companionship represents your ideal, and offering aid to others serves as the motivation to begin your journey. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, Granholm, AKA the \"Youngster,\" and you belong to the same category. Granholm was only 17 years old when he became the Navigator, but he spent his whole life leading the Astral Express.As the Astral Express traversed world after world, new faces arrived and the old ones departed... Whoever they might be, Granholm always welcomed them with open arms.He took on everything personally and assumed the responsibility of connecting with unfamiliar worlds. In a time marred by disasters and fractured worlds, it was Granholm who transformed the Nameless into heroes from beyond the sky.In the worlds rescued by Granholm, many were inspired by him and became new Nameless. There were also many old friends who chose to stay on these worlds in the hope of bringing a better tomorrow to these lands.Granholm dedicated his life to the Astral Express, and at the end of his journey, he rested peacefully in his favorite armchair forever.Shortly after that, the tale of the Astral Express quietly slipped into obscurity, vanishing into the sea of stars. Herald of the Sea of Stars. &lt;br&gt; You are a person who aims for a thriving career and holds the belief that nothing is beyond reach.You love challenges because things that are validated through difficulty are more likely to demonstrate the existence of value.You are focused on pursuing higher goals and never cease your efforts. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, Sam-3000, AKA the \"Guide,\" and you belong to the same category. Sam-3000, who became known as the \"Guide,\" was the Navigator of many navigators.During her active period, the Astral Express wasn't a specific entity, but rather a fleet of trains that traveled in unison along the silver rail.Being an Intellitron, she was forthright, vivacious, and loved to compete, while her hearty mechanical laughter always resonated throughout the cars. The Express took note of her arm-wrestling victories and defeats with all the passengers, even the ones without arms.She resided in an era of enterprise, where the Express ventured into numerous worlds previously unexplored by any before her. Fuli's Eden of Blessed Insight was one such place, where the Nameless claimed to have seen the Enigmata manifesting in the world's reflection.Sam-3000 only resigned as a Navigator when her body's machinery completely deteriorated and its parts could no longer be replaced, and she did so with expectation of a \"Great Trailblazing Era.\" Starry Cape Dancer. &lt;br&gt; You are an extraordinary person rich in emotions and have a remarkable imagination.You are good at understanding and empathizing with the feelings of others, displaying an interest in novel experiences while cherishing nostalgia equally.You value individuality, freedom, and romance, which serve as the foundation for your profound artistic expression. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, Dolly, AKA the \"Crystal,\" and you belong to the same category. According to the Express records, Dolly was a musician from Tiafoe.After hearing about the exploits of Akivili, she gladly boarded the Express, hoping to travel across the starry seas to write a ballad for the \"Trailblaze.\"Many passengers loved Dolly's crystal-clear and elegant voice and boarded the Express just to listen to her ballad.It was said that Akivili had also returned to the Express and stopped to listen to her ballad. They had a long talk with Dolly after that.One day, while the Express was moving, the Nameless all sensed the fall of the Trailblaze. It was also from that moment that Dolly started her irreversible anomalous crystallization.After three days of continuous singing, she handed over the Navigator's role and remained under the stars forever. Long Night Walker. &lt;br&gt; You are a rational thinker who enjoys pondering and excels at it.You possess strong observational skills, a thirst for knowledge, and a deep interest in unraveling the essence of phenomena.You value knowledge, seek independence, and thrive in exploring the unknowns. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, Capy Baba, AKA the \"Three-Eyed,\" and you belong to the same category. Capy Baba was a highly intelligent rodent from the Hydrochoeridae family, and often the passengers were curious about its appearance.At the end of the Swarm Disaster, Capy Baba became the Express' Navigator due to its precise \"predictive ability.\" It preferred sitting in the Express cab, engrossed in reading the logbook, charting star trails, and rarely meeting the passengers... typically deferring all responsibilities, significant or trivial, to its human handler.Its knack for choosing the routes resembled the watchful eye of heaven, deftly steering clear of the encroaching Swarm and safeguarding the Astral Express' safety on numerous occasions.Before the popularization of Synesthesia Beacons, very few knew that Capy Baba was also an astral geographer. Its human handler possessed the ability to interpret the language of most of the Hydrochoeridae members and mentioned that Capy Baba communicated with directness and lacked refinement.Thanks to Capy Baba, the Astral Express revised the star rail map, which is constantly maintained and used today.Having completed its mission, Capy Baba stepped down as Navigator and returned home with honor. Messenger of the Cosmos. &lt;br&gt; You are a trustworthy and reliable partner in the team.You possess a strong sense of responsibility, demonstrate genuine concern for others, and excel in collaborating as part of a team to achieve shared goals.You are good at planning and preparation, finding comfort in navigating uncertainty with a sense of security. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, you are most alike to Oakley, AKA the \"Musketeer.\" According to the Express records, Oakley held the record for being the shortest serving Nameless Navigator \u2014 approximately six months and two days.Initially, Oakley was only an Interastral Peace Corporation bounty hunter with her own destination in mind, harboring no intention of joining the Crew.While the Astral Express was journeying close to the border planet of Frati (only revealed through later investigations), the former Navigator and passengers all vanished mysteriously due to an anomaly. At the request of the conductor, Oakley temporarily assumed the position of Navigator.She single-handedly thwarted numerous attacks from the savage star beasts, bringing the Express back to the safety of the Borderstar Trade Zone.When the Express finally reached safety, she did not immediately step down from her duties. Instead, she assisted in finding more members and searched for the missing individuals.Oakley was reserved, with only a handful of passengers recalling glimpses of her sitting alone at the front of the Express, where she occasionally played the harmonica. And after gathering a sufficient number of new passengers, Oakley quietly left the Express. Bird of Passage. &lt;br&gt; You are a free spirit who focuses on the good and opportunities in life.You possess quick thinking, energy, and confidence, believing that even greater opportunities lie ahead.Life inherently presents itself as an adventurous leap, one that you consistently adapt to and find enjoyment in. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, you are most alike to Bob, aka the \"Touslehead.\" Bob was once a member of the Tarantula, a crime syndicate wanted by the IPC, and claimed to be dead after leaving the organization.Initially, he assumed the role of Express Guard using a false identity, until his true identity was uncovered, leading to his subsequent assignment as the next Navigator.Bob was tall, charming, and consistently messy in his appearance. In his spare time, he loved sleeping, engaging in IPC entertainment programs, and embarking on trailblazing expeditions to explore unfamiliar worlds. Despite claiming to hate silicon-based lives, he invited peaceful mechanical lifeforms aboard the Express in times of war.Throughout Bob's tenure as Navigator, many passengers boarded the Express with unanswered questions, only to have them all resolved accurately before disembarking \u2014 it is said that Bob became the prototype for the character who would later evolve into the \"Tousled Detective\".Bob frequently discussed his retirement plans with his fellow crew members, but he met his demise heroically during a defensive battle. Enlightenment Beacon. &lt;br&gt; You are a strong-willed person who is straightforward and righteous.You are decisive, pragmatic, and energetic, often taking swift and assertive action.You demonstrate exceptional ability in inspiring and safeguarding those around you, leading as a guiding light. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, you are most alike to Falcon Amundsen, aka the \"Morning Star.\" Falcon Amundsen served as the Navigator in the early days of the Cancer of All Worlds, like a beacon of enlightenment amidst the darkness of the night.Under his leadership, the Astral Express regained its former glory, with up to one hundred of passengers at one point.He continued to seek out other Nameless who departed after the fall of the Trailblaze, reclaiming the obstructed silver rail alongside many heroic figures. Many people in the worlds he passed through were inspired by Falcon and volunteered to join the cause of Trailblazing as a new generation of the Nameless.Unfortunately, Falcon Amundsen himself passed away prematurely at the outset of his voyage. Sentinel of Time. &lt;br&gt; You prefer stability, exhibit gentleness toward others, and embrace life as it unfolds.You have the ability to be tolerant and empathize with the perspectives and emotions of others.You have faith and see the best in others, serving as the cornerstone of a harmonious environment. Navigator Profile. Among all the past Navigators in the Astral Express, you are most alike to Isee, aka the \"Starseer.\" He is a mysterious Navigator, whose accounts in the data bank have been frequently manipulated by History Fictionologists.It is now widely believed that Isee boarded the Astral Express toward the end of the Second Prosperity. His journey led him through the successive events of the fall of Akivili and the birth of Nanook, enduring some of the most challenging times, yet he remained steadfast in his commitment to duty.During that period, a number of the Nameless left the Express, and different groups following Trailblaze were also embroiled in internal conflicts. Isee was barely maintaining the connections between the worlds. It is rumored that at one juncture during this extensive and solitary voyage, the Crew dwindled to just two members. However, this was closely followed by the heroic years of Falcon Amundsen.Isee left the Astral Express after stepping down from the Navigator position. During the same period, the Omen Vanguards began to appear in the universe."}

Text. Good News at Sunrise for the Solwarm Festival A Decisive Victory at the Snow Plains War Front There are now more things to celebrate for the people of Belobog this new year. News of victory from the Snow Plains war front outside of the forts reached us by dawn of the Solwarm Festival. The city of Belobog is jubilant and cheers can be heard throughout the day. It has been more than a score of years since the cruel and cunning aliens invaded, and the Solwarm Festival celebrations are held every year through the war to maintain morale. The celebration this year must be the most elated in more than twenty years. The Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand gave a personal command before the Solwarm Festival that all Silvermane Guards would march outside and take formation on the Snow Plains, combating the main forces of the alien army. Rhonda Landau, the hero of our army, protected the gate together with the Amber and Torch Brigades. They fought for four days and nights in the blizzard, never retreating even one step. For the first four days of the battle, the fighting was severe and our army had suffered from not having the main troops on site. However, the enemy's relentless assault never shook our morale, and we continued to defend the pass. On the next day, Jaeger firmly carried out the battle plans previously set out by the Supreme Guardian and formed a vanguard division with the guerrilla fighters, launching a surprise attack on the enemy's right flank and creating an important opening for us. The Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand also attacked behind enemy lines with the Royal Guard and surrounded the enemy. On the dawn of the Solwarm Festival, our armies successfully joined up and formally launched our counter attack. The Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand took to the front lines herself, spear in hand as she led the troops onward. Flames torched the sky everywhere she went. The amber tip of her spear stirred up the very blizzard, and it roared and boomed like thunder from the heavens. According to the Royal Guard members who survived the battlefield, the giant lance of the Supreme Guardian could even tear open the clouds and temporarily show the blue sky that we had not seen for decades. Other soldiers returning from the battlefield said they could feel an unstoppable force with them as they fought alongside Alisa Rand. Under the protection of such majestic powers, the soldiers could even block the enemy's blade strikes with their bare hands and suffer no injuries as a result. The Silvermane Guards attacked with all their might and fought until dawn yesterday and finished off all the enemies. The remains of the enemy forces fled northward over the Snow Plains, and the Supreme Guardian sent troops after them in pursuit. This engagement was an unprecedented battle at the Snow Plains, as well as an unprecedented victory. After this battle, the remaining troops of the aliens were on the brink of utter defeat. Belobog will certainly remain standing in the blizzard, and walk towards total victory with her people in the war of preservation! Silvermane Guards Review Comments: No objections, but it would be better to remove my battalion number. Supreme Guardian Review Comments: Publication permitted."}

They are some of Herta's prized possessions, and are valuable subjects of research for the space station staff, as seen in the Curio Management Log readable. Known Curios. Most Curios can be found in Herta's galleries on Storage Zone F1. The only exceptions are the Door to A New World and certain Curios only mentioned in readables. Astro Rod. Originally created by Herta researchers, the Astro Rod, profile no. 021, allows the user to analyze geological structures with ease. When observed: Broken Blade (\"Unofficial Name\"). A broken blade can be found to the right of the Wing Glider. When observed by all characters besides Himeko: When observed by Himeko: Crackup Conch. When someone holds the Crackup Conch, no. 148, to their ear, they can hear jokes and other funny sounds. The being within may bestow their power to one who can hold back laughter, though said individual runs the risk of dying from an intense depression as a result. Nowadays, this Curio's research is considered outdated. This Curio is involved in the Adventure Mission \"Sensitive Beings (I)\". When observed: Dark Matches. Dark Matches are the antithesis to normal matches; when ignited, they snuff out light and usher in darkness. When seen under bright light, there appear to be green, odorless aerosols emanating from them. Legion abominations are quite fond of them, and have stolen every last one from the space station. Door to A New World. Discovered by the Department of Implement Arts, the Door to A New World, no. 1984, takes the shape of a common toilet, with a functional flushing system included. On a certain planet, there is a rumor that burying one's head in a toilet and flushing will transport them to a new world, and this Curio gives credence to the claim. Unlike the other Curios, this one can be found in the Supply Zone F1 Maintenance Room. Interacting with it will transport the player to another section of the station. Investigating it for the first time will reward the player with the Achievement \"Door to A New World\". Energy Black Hole. The Energy Black Hole, no. 2691, is a heater incapable of actually heating anything. Instead, it absorbs any surrounding heat energy, including that of homeothermic organisms. Due to patterns on its surface, it is suspected of having some relation to the Landau family. When observed: House of Cards (\"Unofficial Name\"). When observed: Joy Filtration Set. The Joy Filtration Set, no. 269, is a collection of 21 individually-packed items that are capable of collecting joy and joy-adjacent emotions. When observed: Light of the Stars. The Light of the Stars, no. 056, is described as a \"tiny, pristine, well-decorated box,\" which has 36 drawers that each contain a crystal that \"corresponds to a color on the starlight spectrum.\" However, due to the invasion of the Antimatter Legion, it was damaged and is currently awaiting repair. As such, the player is unable to interact with it. Rating Pistol. The Rating Pistol, no. 752, looks like a normal forehead thermometer, albeit with a single swirling, disdainful eye. It \"rates\" various items and creatures using an unknown system, making it the topic of many theories among the space station researchers. When the player interacts with it, different scores are given depending on the active character. Investigating it for the first time will reward the player with the Achievement \"Just A Number\". Reject Silence. Reject Silence is a miniature orchestra set that plays exotic music when ambient noise is at 0 decibels, and remains silent when not. However, due to damage sustained from the Legion invasion, it has the inverse function; the noisier the surrounding area is, the noisier the Curio becomes. Total Eclipse of the Heart. The Total Eclipse of the Heart, no. 1381, is a conical device that is able to corrode and disintegrate objects into basic particles. Once the number of disintegrated items exceeds a certain point, the corrosion area expands, adversely affecting living organisms. Despite this, it sees much use on the space station, though permission is required to utilize it. When observed: Unbearable Weight. The Unbearable Weight, no. 458, is actually the royal crown of the extinct Tottonid race. When Tottonid emperors die, their silicon-based bodies become pure mineral; their crystalline logic centers would then be embedded into the crown. It is believed that through this, future rulers may inherit the wisdom of their ancestors. Using this Curio to decipher a mysterious sound awards the player the Achievement \"No King Rules Forever\" When observed: Wind Glider. When observed: Various Observations. Some Curios have no specific dialogue or backstory, and can simply be observed: Mentioned Curios. The following are a list of mentioned curios that cannot be found in the space station."}

When the cones are parallel, the device is activated. When activated, any object that crosses the outer ring will be corroded and disintegrated into basic particles. The device is usually used to disintegrate waste products on the space station and transmute them into usable materials for the different departments.

Activate the heating mode of the space station's thermostat system before utilizing the Curio. Curio Profile: A heater fueled by some kind of clean energy, it was once used as an electric pancake pan by an IPC trade commissioner (note: attempted). After being spotted by a Department of Implement Arts researcher, it was brought to the space station. The patterns on the surface of the heater was ascertained by the Department of Insight to be the crest of an anonymous family and the name of a person suspected of being \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Landau. The heating function of the heater is non-functional and non-responsive to any fuel inserted. According to the current observation record, the heater will actively absorb heat energy from surrounding objects, and excessive exposure to it can cause hypothermic reactions to homeothermic animals. P.S. A joint experiment from the Departments of Implement Arts and Service has shown that the energy that the heater can absorb does not, in fact, include caloric energy from food items.Related Studies: 1.

It can be obtained by speaking to Balaway for the first time. Text. To all vagrants who dig for ancient relics, Regrettably, I will be stopping my appraisal services at the end of this tax period. The consulting location at the market will also be closed. In other words, from this day forward, if you stumble over something in the mines, or if your mining team happens upon an ancient weapon, don't think it's a gift from the gods. And don't bother carrying all that junk over to me. As mentioned above, it's done. I'm done. I'm sure some of you will be pondering the reason behind my quitting when work is going well. I suppose I should make the effort to give everyone a proper response. First of all, it's a thankless job. When I started this business, I wanted to use the Old World manuals I tirelessly collected to help everyone analyze and appraise their ancient relics. That way, everyone would at least have a sense of the items they found, and can have a better sense of value when selling their items. It's pretty clear for those who know. These days, no one understands how people from the Old World built these machines, much less the knowledge they had in their heads. Some ancient relics explode when exposed to the air, making it more dangerous than a mine filled with gas. Some were as plain as a metal rod, not unlike the one your wife uses to poke the stove. But push the button somewhere on it, it'll be as scary as one of your wife's temper tantrums. Let me give you an example. During the last tax period, I received an egg-shaped object. (That's right, the kind of egg sold at Belobog Meat Factory.) Anyway, I went through all the manuscripts, including Old World magazines, and finally concluded that it was some kind of jewelry, known as the \"Ramlea Egg.\" Let's start with a question: What is jewelry? After asking old Uther, we learned that jewelry was a type of decoration you can wear. It seems that Old World people really had nothing better to do. The old man banged the egg a few times on the table, then removed the pin on the top, which might have been used to hang something on it. Suddenly, the egg started heating up and glowing. It produced a light stronger than hundreds of mine lamps stacked together (Uther might have exaggerated this). The old man could already barely see anything, and now he definitely can't. You can say that I was lucky. When the incident happened, I was in the other room making tea. My eyes were fine but the old man's threatened to take out my eyes until I offered him sixty canned goods. Do you understand now? I'm putting my life on the line for you guys, but the money you're paying me won't even cover my medical fees. Right, here's the second point: Miner's Lamp's standards were called into question. The area outside Boulder Town is getting more and more dangerous and more and more vagrants are coming here. But with more people, comes more gossip. I've heard enough of foolish things like \"Balaway is a blind appraiser,\" or \"Any vagrant from Rivet Town is better than him.\" I don't know what game they're playing with this slander, but I'm not interested. Better to simply pack my bags and leave. After all, it should be easy to find a better appraiser, right? I have been faithfully serving you lucky dogs in the past and never thought of coveting the ancient goods you dug up. The very reason is that I am an honest person and have never done anything to cheat. But what about those outsiders? Can you trust them? They are nothing but a bunch of self-serving scoundrels who only care for themselves. They will denigrate those goods you value, but if you believe their nonsense and sold you goods to them as if you were selling scraps, then they will happily take them to flip for a high price elsewhere. But, Miner's Lamp Balaway is not a heartless person. I can make exceptions. If the treasure you have is of great value, I might still be able to help you check it out. Think of me as being so fervently compassionate about no one getting cheated out of their fortune that I'll break my hiatus for these exceptional cases. But if it's just a piece of scrap, I suggest you find someone else. Balaway has henceforth ended his appraisal services."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5336","text":"Cyrille (Readable) Cyrille is a three-part readable found in Jarilo-VI, obtained from completing, and . It sheds light on the fates of Cyrille, her sister Cyrilla, and Stefan Marquez. An Old Diary. Mr. Stefan came to chat once again today, and I'm happy. Mr. Stefan first came to our home about six months ago. I thought he was just like those adults who call themselves Architects, and was here to see my sister. But he was different, and didn't ignore me. He always smiles, and gives me lots and lots of candy. He also asked me some questions and I got nervous because I didn't know how to answer, but he didn't get angry. He said I was a quiet and good kid. I started keeping a diary because of Mr. Stefan. He said that keeping a diary is a good habit for a lady to keep. He also said that keeping a diary is a very lonely affair, and that if I'm scared of being alone, I can just read aloud the diary to him. To be honest, it's really hard to keep a diary because nothing interesting happens to me \u2014 I won't read this part to Mr. Stefan as he'll get sad, and I don't want him to be sad. I wish I were my sister, because she knows everything. She always tells me fun stories and is always telling me about the interesting people she meets. It was only later that I realized most of my diary was about Mr. Stefan. Sometimes it's recounting our conversations, sometimes it's recording what I've learned from him, sometimes it's simply recording my mood while I wait for him to visit again. Today, Mr. Stefan and I talked a lot, mostly trying to comfort me as I'd heard some bad news from another kid. I heard that the adults want to take my sister to some place far away, and that I might never be able to see her again. I'm scared because my sister always looks after me and protects me. If she goes, I might get hurt \u2014 and I might get even more lonely than I already am now. Mr. Stefan told me that he wouldn't let that happen. He said, \"Cyrille is no less than her sister,\" and \"Cyrille deserves her own wonderful life.\" I know he's just saying that to comfort me, but it still feels nice to hear that from him. Before he left, Mr. Stefan gave me a blue stone which, despite its small size, is shiny and smooth. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Mr. Stefan said this present represents our agreement \u2014 that he will take me out of here to a more spacious and comfortable place. A place without prison, a place with freedom. I trust Mr. Stefan. He's a man of his word, unlike all the others. Today's entry is very long \u2014 longer than the whole of the previous week combined \u2014 and I'm a little tired. It's late, and I should go to bed. My sister didn't come home today, and it's just me home tonight. I'm going to sleep with the gift that Mr. Stefan gave me, so that I won't be afraid of the dark. An Old Letter. Cyrille: I've been caught up in some complications, and I can't be there with you. I beg your forgiveness, and hope that you always remember that the distance between us in space will not shake my loyalty one bit. No matter what difficulties you face, you can always turn to me for help. I know you must be nervous right now, Cyrille, but I hope you can remember what I warned you before: Don't be intimidated by loud and empty threats. As long as you stand firm and follow my advice at all times, any pushback or complaint is just temporary white noise \u2014 something that will fade away as we draw closer to the end of the plan and ultimately become a picture painted together by us. I sometimes still think of when I met you, more than ten years ago. You were a timid little girl back then, too shy to talk and lacking confidence in yourself. But I found something special in you \u2014 a one-of-a-kind temperament that even a genius like Cyrilla doesn't have. And it's precisely because of this unique talent of yours that I decided to stay with you, and help you build up the beautiful future that you deserve. As for your sister, Cyrilla \u2014 unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any clues about her whereabouts. I understand how important she is to you, so I'll keep sparing no effort in my search operation. Even without the slightest progress over more than ten years, I still don't want to give up hope \u2014 and I hope you don't give up, either. Finally, I'd like to offer my most sincere advice once more: don't trust those opportunists in your ear telling you black is white and vice versa. They'll definitely use my absence to try and get close to you and control your mind. You have to build a solid barrier and resist their scheming noises. Remember, Cyrille \u2014 you just have to trust me. I would never lie to you. Your sincerest friend,Stefan Cyrille \"The Fool\". Cyrille \u2014 often called Cyrille the Fool by later generations \u2014 is the eighth Supreme Guardian of Belobog. Cyrille was born in a remote suburb of the Belobog Overworld. Orphaned as a young girl, she lived with her sister Cyrilla who's one year older than her. Cyrille's childhood was rather uneventful; however, her sister Cyrilla was a child prodigy, displaying amazing proficiency at an early age for language, math, and logic. Cyrilla passed the public service test when she was eleven, and was officially selected as an heir to the Supreme Guardian. However, just on the eve as the Architects were about to relocate her residence to Qlipoth Fort, she mysteriously disappeared. After days of searching without luck, most Architects wanted to give up the search and start the heir selection process anew. But the Minister of Internal Affairs, Stefan Marquez was firmly opposed, and strongly pushed for Cyrilla's sister Cyrille to take over as heir to the Supreme Guardian. Stefan Marquez claimed that during his long-term contact with the two sisters, he'd discovered that Cyrille was as talented as her sister. Moreover, delaying the heir selection process any longer would impact Belobog's political stability due to the recency of the Supreme Guardian's untimely death. After heated internal debate, the Architects finally approved Stefan's proposal allowing Cyrille to become the new heir. History has shown us that Cyrille's appointment was a carefully-planned hoax by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Stefan Marquez. The Architects quickly realized that Cyrille was extremely mediocre compared to her sister Cyrilla, and was clumsy in social situations. Minister Marquez's power grew stronger by the day during Cyrille's tenure, and his thugs soon retained absolute discretion throughout the Qlipoth Fort as they issued their draconian decrees. The nickname Cyrille the Fool spread throughout the people, and they grew more and more dissatisfied with this puppet Supreme Guardian and her ministerial allies. In the 14th year of her tenure, rebels among the Architects hatched a secret plot to overthrow Stefan and his cronies. The rebels won over the Silvermane Guards' Captain and planned on luring Cyrille and Stefan to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone where they could launch a coup. That day, the Supreme Guardian Cyrille attended the military exercise as expected, but the rebels never found any trace of Stefan Marquez. The captain played them at their own game, dispatching a fake patrol of Silvermane Guards into the restricted zone with Cyrille, and pushing her into an arsenal chest. The guards then rushed to the far north of Belobog and, under cover of darkness, shoved the unconscious Supreme Guardian in the arsenal chest over the edge of the cliff. The rebels carried out a search operation for three days and three nights in Belobog, but never found any trace of Minister Stefan Marquez. To this day, people still attribute the death of the seventh Supreme Guardian and the disappearance of Cyrilla to Marquez's political conspiracy \u2014 a claim that, according to Belobog historians, to this day remains inconclusive and unproven."}

The church both feared and craved for the devils' powers, which was how the conflicted result came to be... The church captured a newborn devil, trained her to become a valiant Solemn Knight, yet forbid her to ever reveal her true appearance, molded her to always obey the pontiff's order, and eventually made her the Maiden's silent knight. Maiden Vanira was of a similar age to Safina, and she was the one who guided Safina to learn the scriptures.

The Maiden of the Church of Purity Palace carefully washed the sins from the armor, recited reverent prayers to god, and sealed an ancient miracle on a point on the breastplate right above the heart. The Church did not believe in the loyalty of devils, but they were convinced that their doctrines could purify everything.

THEY tirelessly hunt them down, driven by the devastation the Abundance caused on THEIR homeworld. In contrast with the other Aeons, Lan pays close attention to mortals. THEY often appear before them, but move too fast to be seen, the only portents of THEIR presence being vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky. THEIR first appearance was around Year 3400 of the Star Calendar with THEIR Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow severing the Abundance's Ambrosial Arbor. Appearance. Lan is described as a tall, valiant prince with a crown in the Simulated Universe. THEY possess centaur like features, taking form of a man combined with an equine below the waist, while the hind legs are replaced by wheels of a chariot. History. Origin Myth. A Xianzhou origin myth found in the \"Ode to Reignbow Path\" describes the pre-ascended Reignbow Arbiter as an anonymous Xianzhou hero. This is believed to be historical truth by a minority of academics. However, there is no factual evidence to show that the hero is Lan. Although the Xianzhou Alliance has never outright denied the myth's authenticity, their unclear stance on the subject has been taken as an implicit denial. The Reignbow Arbiter was originally not a god, but a mortal before the Three Sufferings era, leading the Xianzhou army against the Heliobi, who formed a red micro-star to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad led by the Reignbow disassembled and weaponized the auxiliary engine of the Xianzhou Yaoqing. It was sent straight into the the red star, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. After their victory, the Xianzhou army locked up the defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, sentencing them to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life. The planting of the Ambrosial Arbor on the Xianzhou Luofu brought celebration and joy for the immortality it promised. However, the Reignbow foresaw the devastation it would cause to Xianzhou, possibly with the help of the Wisdomwalker. When they tried to warn the others of this future, they were mocked and labeled as insane. To show their resolve, they shot the Ambrosial Arbor\u2014leading to their conviction. The aristocrats who had eaten the fruit were enraged, but awed by the Reignbow's heroic exploits and prestige, could only sentence them to continual hibernation in cryo-sleep pods. Fatigued and overwhelmed from the previous battles and the invasion of the Denizens of Abundance, the Xianzhou decided to raise all prisoners of the cryo-hibernation from their slumber, including Reignbow. Once awakened, they descended into the prison deep within the Xianzhou Zhuming and made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing them to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of Heliobi. Inspired by Reignbow\u2019s sacrifice, many Xianzhou residents made the same deal and formed suicide squads that marched alongside the Heliobi. The Reignbow's arrow\u2014borrowing the power of The Flint Emperor\u2014destroyed the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrated the almighty beast and severed the connection between the Luofu and the giant tree Muldrasil of the Wingweavers. This ripped open a fissure into the void and a monstrous wave of imaginary force spewed from it, affecting every ship of the Xianzhou Alliance. After the battle, the Reignbow disappeared and rose to Aeonhood, becoming Lan, The Hunt. Star Calendar. In Year 3400, the Reignbow Arbiter appeared for the first time and severed the Ambrosial Arbor with THEIR Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow, saving the Xianzhou Luofu from the Muldrasil and the wingweavers. In Year 4100, the Reignbow Arbiter became the undisputed main Aeon of the Xianzhou Alliance, displacing the Xianzhou's previous worship of Qlipoth. In Year 7900, the Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect Reignbow's manifestation. Trace elements pointed to three coordinates in the Consternation Starzone: The Yadav variable star; the Cerulean Nightmare; and the Knucklebone. Using the Matrix of Prescience, the master diviner predicted that it must have been plagued. In Year 7954, the Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect traces of Reignbow's Lux Arrow nearby Laevateinn-XVI. When the Cloud Knights' Thunderclap Orbit Fleet arrived at the coordinates, the planet had been destroyed without any survivors remaining. It was categorized as a \"deadworld,\" and deleted from the astral charts. In Year 8072, Fu Xuan and the Xianzhou sent out an SOS signal to the Reignbow as they were facing defeat in the Third Abundance War. The Reignbow attacked the Denizens of Abundance besieging the Xianzhou Fanghu. A Lux Arrow cut through the enemy and in the process, nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the bombardment. Amber Era.

Shortly thereafter, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky, leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces. Half a unit of system time later, the entirety of the planet Xuange imploded. Xuange's inhabitants were affected by the molting disease and the planet's destruction was attributed to the Hunt. Abilities. Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow. The Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow is a projectile weapon shot by Lan that can shatter stars light-years away. Shards of the Lux Arrow can be reforged by the Furnace Master, chief of the Xianzhou artisans, for those who are worthy. At the end of the Third Denizens of Abundance War, Reignbow Arbiter's Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow wiped out everything along the way. The Xianzhou people used the burning embers of the arrow to create many divine objects. The Lux Arrow is the only known material that can harm the Ambrosial Arbor. The arrows are made with stars and shot with gravity. Although the Simulated Universe Index says that Lan often appears before mortals, Fu Xuan says that THEY rarely appear before mortals and \"the only portents of THEIR presence are vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky.\" The Record of Reignbow's Road says that \"Reignbow would never speak to any mortal... THEY only let their Lux Arrow do all the talking.\" According to Welt, Lan does not rank among the more powerful Aeons as THEIR path is very narrow, but THEY pay close attention to mortals. THEY grant strength to the Xianzhou Alliance without reservation, allowing their marshal and six generals to stand on par with the Lord Ravagers, Emanators of Nanook the Destruction. Lightning Lord.

However, THEY move too fast, and very few observations have been made about THEIR actual form. Most of the reliable information is kept by the Xianzhou Alliance and it took me a great amount of effort to get. As one of the rare factions in the universe that is completely blessed by an Aeon, the Alliance stands on equal grounds with the IPC, which meant the IPC couldn't help me at all. In the end, Ruan Mei had to step up to help. In the ancient Xianzhou language, \"Lan\" means \"an unpredictable fog,\" and the Aeon's formal name in Xianzhou is Reignbow Arbiter. According to Xianzhou natives, the Lux Arrow of The Hunt showed them the way as their civilization was about to fall... Dev Log2. Related Entry \u2014 The Hunt ...How would you describe the Aeon of The Hunt? We can get an impression from the Xuange Observation Station's report in AE 2131. The astronomical observation system detected a gravitational wave, a spatial disturbance left by an entity traveling too fast to be measured and covering astronomical distances. Shortly thereafter, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky, leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces. Half a unit of system time later, the entirety of the planet Xuange imploded. The bad news was the IPC lost a planet in its business sphere. The good news was the IPC was out of ideas regarding the molting disease (undoubtedly the work of Yaoshi) spreading throughout Xuange. The light permanently \"healed\" that planet and the patients on it, a race of immortal half-human half-snake monsters. This is the action and creed of The Hunt, for whom salvation and destruction are nigh indistinguishable. Their perpetual enemy, the Abundance, is the same, for THEY bring healing and torment hand-in-hand..."}

Chapter 1: Calamity Ensnares Commission of Alchemy And the Alchemy Commission was plagued with threats internal and external \u2014 the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were wreaking havoc within, while Abominations and the Ambrosial Arbor loomed beyond. Seeing the crisis, (Trailblazer) yet laughed loudly at the companions behind them. The heroes were confused as to the reason of the laughter, and (Trailblazer) calmly explained \u2014 \"I laugh at the folly of these Abominations of Abundance, and at idiocy of the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.\" (Warrior 4) cupped their hands in praise \u2014 \", you couldn't have said it better! I have heard of your fierce battle against the Ruin Legion on \"Ya Li Luo-VI\" \u2014 even with the help of the Doomsday Beast, the Legion could not escape an overwhelming defeat. And now, these Abominations and demon have schemed and plotted, yet the best they could summon was an Ebon Deer that stands no chance against a mighty warrior such as you!\" The companions exchanged smiles, their morale renewed afresh. At this moment of high spirits, they heard a whooshing sound in the distance \u2014 the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus wielded colossal crossbows, firing a steady stream of projectiles in a play to catch the companions off guard. (Warrior 3) casually caught the flying arrows, and tossed them back to their owners! Screams and screeches rose in tandem, for these dishonorable scoundrels were now having a taste of their own medicine. (Warrior 1) and (Warrior 2) looked at each other and instantly shared the same thought: \"We must not let others look down on the two of us.\" Then, they worked their internal qi, made a double jump onto the air to fly up, and pounced on the enemy. Of course, the chaos that ensued is another story altogether! Chapter 2: Nameless Battles Author of Plagues It was said that the Ebon Deer had a hide of iron and hooves of bronze, impervious to sword and spear. Its eyes glowed like burning lamps, and its cry whistled through the air like the wailing of a terrible ghost. Any ordinary person who encounters such a monster will surely be scared out of their wits. (Trailblazer) and companions, however, were not fazed in the least. Esteemed audience, can you guess why? Because the four heroes in this story each have their own special abilities and unique skills, and the fighting spirit and endurance to match. Defeating the wicked beast of Abundance was but a moment's effort for our heroes! For it is said that (Warrior 1) stood eight feet tall and spanned eight feet across the waist. When they lowered their head to look down upon the Ebon Deer, it was akin to a giant looking at a child. They had cultivated their martial skills to perfection \u2014 the sharpest of blades are futile against such a person. Seeing that its antlers could not gore the hero, the Deer stomped its bronze hooves on the ground with a howl, and branches of the Ambrosial Arbor sprouted out in all directions, firmly wrapping around (Warrior 1)'s limbs. For a time, the two were at a standstill. It was at this moment that (Warrior 2) entered the melee. They raised their giant fists, the size of an aurumaton's hands, and pounded relentlessly. The monster's hide was thick, but a moment had not passed before the shock from (Warrior 2)'s heavy blows delivered grave internal injuries, and blood flowed from its nostrils. As most can guess, internal injuries don't always have external manifestations \u2014 though there was nary a scratch on the skin of the beast, its insides were already beaten to a rotten pulp. The Ebon Deer would not last more than a few years with such wounds. But (Trailblazer) knew well such a monstrosity, though mortally wounded, could not be allowed to roam freely and terrorize the citizenry. With a gesture from, (Warrior 3) sprung into action, the sword in their hand spinning as it dispatched the vines grappling (Warrior 1). With a flash of the sword and flick of the wrist, (Warrior 4) dashed straight towards the enemy, and sent the Ebon Deer to the ground with just one blow! As it turned out, the beast was susceptible to fire, and (Warrior 4) knew how to use it well. Quick as a lightning flash, this monster that had stricken fear in countless fell to the ground at the hands of our heroes, never to rise again! Chapter 3: Traveler Treasures Heart of Scions It was said the High Elder (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) was the living embodiment of nature's pinnacle and the breathing epitome of heaven's zenith, and was set by divine destiny to be born into this mortal world. (Trailblazer) reckons \"a diamond must be cut and polished before it can shine \u2014 without a wise teacher and good friends, (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) could well join the dark side and follow in the footsteps of the predecessor, Imbibitor Lunae.\" Though (Trailblazer) had no blood relation to the High Elder, they had the responsibility to raise the High Elder. And so, summoned their four companions to inquire about how to best educate the young (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe), desirous of giving him a bright future. (Warrior 1) said: \"This is the future leader of the Vidyadhara \u2014 if he has not mastered the art of warfare and combat, how can he live up to the mandate of heaven or claim earthly glory? How will he maintain his authority? It is known that General Jing Yuan excels in the art of war and is the Sword Champion's disciple. Why shouldn't the general be the teacher?\" (Warrior 2) said: \"That won't do! How can the cultivation of an outstanding talent be confined to violence? It's known that Master Diviner Fu Xuan's spares none. She is a genius at tactics and strategy and is also literate and eloquent to a fault. Besides, she enjoys all pedagogical endeavors. If Master Diviner Fu can be the teacher, (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) will become adept in the ways of the cosmos and of worldly affairs!\" (Warrior 3) shook their head heavily: \"It's said you need a famous teacher to train a great student \u2014 how can a hero be cultivated by such mediocre characters? If I may offer a better suggestion \u2014 There is a certain genius named Madam Herta, whose space station orbits The Blue. She has even gained the favor of Nous the Wisdomwalker and reached the level of becoming their Emanator. Her domain, the space station, is home to 72 sages, three thousand researchers, and more Curios than could ever be counted! (Trailblazer) could inform Herta that (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) is a Curio from far across the stars and ask for her audience this way. When you meet her, convince her with rarity and appeal to her with cuteness. That would surely pique Madam Herta's curiosity and make her eager to become (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s teacher.\" (Warrior 4) sat and pondered deeply with their eyes downcast, and after a few moments looked up and said: \"As the saying goes, 'You are the company you keep.' I heard that on \"Ya Li Luo-VI\" there is a child prodigy named Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, who is wise beyond her years \u2014 she even recruited persons of upstanding character to form a gallant group called The Moles. Being tutored by an adult would surely spoil (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s childlike innocence and simplicity \u2014 why not entrust him to The Moles and let him grow into his own person in a natural way, spending his childhood in careless play? So, what does (Trailblazer) think? When it comes to pre-school education, aren't the Moles the best? After all, the Moles are !\" After hearing everyone's eager contributions of balderdash, (Trailblazer) firmly believed that with the combined efforts of their companions and (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s innate talent, they would surely be able to raise (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) as an outstanding High Elder of the Vidyadhara. Chapter 4: Dragonlord Commands Wrath of Seas After (Trailblazer) completed the trial and found the dragon egg under the guidance of the wise Vidyadhara spirits, (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) descended and subsequently provided powerful support for the group. The people often saw a heroic and dashing carrying out justice together with an adorable child, who wielded a long lance and stood floating on fortuitous clouds. This hero also joined hands with many a valiant leader on the Luofu and beyond, determined to eradicate the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and the evil of the Ambrosial Arbor. One day (Trailblazer) and (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) came to Scalegorge Waterscape and gazed there upon the shimmering waters of the vast ancient sea, like a drop of empyreal jade, where all things that ever were are lost to the billowing waves. It should be known that the Vidyadhara are born from the ancient sea, and to the ancient sea they are destined to return. The sight of their old home filled (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) with elation, and they could hardly wait to put down the lance, untie their red silk sash at their waist, and go frolic at the water's edge. Being of the dragon race, visiting the water gives the Vidyadhara quietude, clarity, and even epiphany. The young High Elder began playing with their red silk sash in the sea, enjoying the water as if it were second nature. However, it unintentionally started to cast a, its magical notes stirring this into gloomy darkness and lifting giant waves into the air. The Abominations hiding nearby could not endure the relentless barrage, and they came out in droves expecting to face the wrath of an earth-shattering giant. Instead, they saw a small child, and they were filled with an indomitable rage: \"If this small child is already capable of such feats, how can we hope to survive when they are fully grown!?\" And then these fiends born from the Arbor showed their claws and approached (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe), vowing to exterminate the hatchling right there and then. (Trailblazer) rose up anxiously to protect the young one, shouting: \"Harm not my child!\" Yet (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe) remained calmed and composed, and simply shouted: \"Part!\" With the raising of (Dan Heng\/Cold Dragon Young\/High Elder MK2000\/John Doe)'s red sash, the tides of Scalegorge Waterscape moved as though they were alive, obeying the command to part and never to close back. The Abominations, with their murderous fury, were all pulled into the bottomless ravine between the waters \u2014 even their bones were torn out of existence! If any of you have the opportunity to visit Scalegorge Waterscape, the tide that parted and never closed back is a living testament to the unfathomable power of this little Vidyadhara! Chapter 5: Xianzhou Laments Woes of Age Ladies and gentlemen, it is important to know that when a divine weapon takes shape, it is often heralded by extraordinary signs. Mountains crumble, rivers run dry, and blood-soaked rain accompanies the wailing of ghosts. Without such phenomena, its divine nature would not be revealed. Through countless hardships, (Trailblazer) had forged (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth\/Big Sword\/Reaper of Nexus Modder\/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon). As it emerged into the world, the heavens and earth grew solemn, delves trembled, and the balance of the Meridian Pin faltered. Whether it be the of the Artisanship Commission or the plants and trees of the Alchemy Commission, all sentient beings with or without emotions rejoiced at the birth of this weapon capable of vanquishing Lord Ravagers. Yet, they also keenly sensed the profound death and destruction it will bring forth in the future. At this moment, sorrow filled the hearts of plants and trees, and tears flew from young and old alike. Even the renowned Master Gongshu, who was accustomed to witnessing the creation of exceptional weapons, couldn't help but exclaim when he sensed the murderous aura emanating from the divine weapon: \"In the current ranking of armaments on Xianzhou, (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth\/Big Sword\/Reaper of Nexus Modder\/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon) deserves to be at the forefront!\" (Trailblazer) was intrigued by his words and asked, \"I am but a simple and ignorant one. Pray tell, good sir, if there be talk of an armament ranking, surely there must be other marvels of weaponry aboard the Xianzhou that are worthy of my attention!\" \"When it comes to divine armament and marvels of weaponry, I am indeed the expert. Allow me to share some insights with the .\" \"In terms of sheer power, it is undoubtedly the Devastator Glaive wielded by General Jing Yuan. This weapon was crafted from the remnants of the Lux Arrow, which was shot by the Reignbow to extinguish the embers of fallen stars. It weighs a staggering 13,500 catties! When held in the general's hand, it may appear like an ordinary Cloud Knight's glaive of moderate length. But when unleashed in its full glory, held by the divine spirit summoned by the general, this weapon defies the heavens and the earth. A single strike has the power to sunder mountains and cleave peaks!\" \"When it comes to sapience, the foremost recommendation is the spherical astrolabe wielded by the esteemed master diviner. This wondrous artifact resembles a wheel, constantly rotating. Embedded within it are 108 jade abaci, attuned to the profound patterns of the Matrix of Prescience. It can divine fortunes and evil, discern auspicious and ominous signs, and unveil the most prudent courses of action. Truly, it is a brilliant beacon illuminating the nebulous mysteries of pasts and futures! A treasure, indeed!\" \"When it comes to precision, there is only one that stands out \u2014 the Bow of Spirit wielded by Madam Yukong, the Helm Master of the Sky-Faring Commission. When the bowstring is drawn, it becomes one with the archer, guiding the darting arrows unerringly to their targets, piercing hearts with every shot!\" Upon hearing this, (Trailblazer) was filled with joy. \"So many awe-inspiring marvels of weaponry are aboard the Xianzhou and yet none of them are put to good use. You see, they are a gift. A gift to the foes of evil. Why not use these weapons? One does not simply lock away their precious. Why not lend them to me and my friends to deal with the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and drive away the Ruin Legion? With these weapons of power in hand, it would just be a piece of cake, wouldn't it?\" \"(At this point of the story, I'm seriously finding it difficult to continue. If I boast too much about the weapons on Luofu, it would actually imply that their masters have been spectators and didn't want to do any work throughout the whole affair... How can I possibly make that narrative work and tie it all together? Well, forget it., I can't continue with this script, so I'll just put my signature on it and give it to you. Consider it a collector's item. Treasure it!)\" Chapter 6: Trailblazer Fails Sanctum of Exaltation Though Phantylia, the master primus of all evil, was eliminated, the Ambrosial Arbor it poisoned was on the verge of losing control. This towering plant sprouted rapidly, and the Abominations of Abundance hiding in its branches and veins poured into the human realm as they gained bodies of corporeal flesh and blood. (Trailblazer) knew that, should the Ambrosial Arbor be allowed to grow to its full, the Xianzhou Luofu shall be reduced to a ship of the dead. Faced with veritable tsunamis of Abominations of Abundance, (Trailblazer) signaled the band of heroes to retreat while providing cover for them. At that precipitous moment, yelled: \"(Will this blow pierce through the stars?\/I'll be back!\/Oops, was it my line?\/Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!)\" Like a lightning bolt that slammed into the ground, the light that exploded out of (Star-Shattering Blade of Truth\/Big Sword\/Reaper of Nexus Modder\/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon) engulfed all, stabbing toward and tearing apart the Ambrosial Arbor, destroying the very sky itself. For a moment, the ground toppled and the sky trembled in the Xianzhou's countless delves, as if the Reignbow had returned to shoot down stars, as if the death of the divine wood sent up a cataclysmic dust storm. After the clouds dissipated a few days later and the Xianzhou returned to peace, the Cloud Knights guarding the Arbor sought unceasingly for (Trailblazer) and yet could not find a single trace of them, just like the ephemeral theophany of the Reignbow. When General Jing Yuan heard the news, he could not help but lament and shed tears worthy for a hero. However, though the general is wise, he did not divine that legendary characters such as (Trailblazer) will never die in the company of demons and crowns. Blessed by the Cloudstrider, (Trailblazer) had already left the devastation and quietly started on a new hero's journey. The Ruin Legion still ravages the starry seas, and the worlds waiting for salvation are endless. The legend of the heroes of the Trailblaze continues on! As it is said:Serene was the Xianzhou, free from harm. Quiet was the palace, rich in charm.Until the demons breached the gate, leaving the palace bloodied by fate.Then comes a, tall and strong. Flesh and iron, seven feet long.Evil minions fall to might. Under staff, they bleed in flight.Mounting the clouds, pursues all foes. Riding the dragon, purges all woes.Towards the sky, splits through. Onto the arbor, strikes true."}

When Stories Become Truth: Re-Discovering Childhood in \"Leisha and Mrs. Trude\" Author: Olsen, journalist of \"Belobog Weekly\" Countless Belobog residents grew up with fairytales. However, while ordinary adults would gradually bid their childhood farewell with age, musical lovers got a chance to return to their childhood. On April 8, the musical \"Leisha and Mrs. Trude\" adopted from the classical fairytale will re-open at the Golden Theater. The special charm of musicals made every corner of the theater fill with supernatural fairy tale beauty the moment \"Leisha and Mrs. Trude\" started. The traditional sing-and-dance format of musicals were broken in this two-hour music extravaganza. To suit the tastes of younger audiences, the performers stood on stilts and had puppet shows. These adjustments were very effective \u2014 in \"Belobog Weekly\"'s annual Best Musical Award this year, \"Leisha and Mrs. Trude\" won the Young Adult's Choice by a wide margin. \"This is a unique experience merging stories together with reality. I have three children and they're not all around the same age. The oldest is fourteen and the youngest is only six, but they all think this show was amazing. Now they finally have something in common to talk about.\" A parent stated this excitedly when we found them sitting outside the theater in a foldable chair, waiting for tickets to go on sale. According to the education report released by the Ministry of Education of Belobog, \"Leisha and Mrs. Trude\" was the most popular children's story in Belobog in the past thirty years. Kyle, the show's director, told us that the musical contains many magnificent and creative backdrops and sets that are inspired by the children's story. At the same time, every song is longer than the average musical number. \"It's because we need to demonstrate the details of the fairytale forest during every song, and we need to make every animal character come to life.\" In the two-hour fairytale journey of \"Leisha and Mrs. Trude\", the audience can sing with the actors under the spotlight, and can also have unique interactions with the fantastic animals in the fairytale forest on stage.

However, it remains unclear which branches of the Swarm were responsible for reproduction during this era. When the \"uncivilized\" Lepismat system was first discovered by \"civilization,\" the planet's surface teemed with swarms of insects. The diverse ecology of Lepismat had attracted numerous bounty hunters from star systems spanning up to 10,000 light-years away. However, at some point, the ancient insects gradually drifted toward the brink of extinction. The only thing confirmed by the evidence is that there must have been something behind that cataclysmic massacre on Lepismat that lead to Tayzzyronth becoming the last member of the Coleoptera, causing him to ascend to Aeonhood and ignite the Path of Propagation out of a desire born from loneliness.

Letter From the Comet Hunter (I). To any Herta Space Station researcher who picks up this letter: Hi there! You still alive? Call it a bummer if you want, but the fact that the space station is surrounded by Antimatter Legion is hardly news to anyone. The entire universe knows about it except for the indifferent, head-in-the-sand bunch Preservation. Other folks would at least make a bet during their downtime on how much time the space station has left. If you ask me, I'd say the space station is done for. Didn't think the Legion would actually do their job this time. Bad news for the space station though. I, on the other hand, made a small fortune out of this. I wonder how livid your Madam Herta must be. My new boss has made it clear: if this \"genius\" really does need help, the Intelligentsia Guild is willing to put everything on the table, as long as she recognizes that the Genius Society is not any better than the Intelligentsia Guild. What say you? Tell her about this generous offer. If things do work out, send your reply to the tavern \"World's End.\" There's a seat if you walk in, turn left and walk five steps. You'll find it on the ninth row, the one with an iron bell and an Aster Falcifolius plant hanging over. Shove the letter under the four liter Kapo-Kali tankard. Ha! Obnoxious Former Researcher of YoursHosea Lazaro Letter From the Comet Hunter (II). To young researchers in the Department of Cosmic Geography: My young fellows, pals or whatever! Behold! A tapestry lies before you on which your former Department of Cosmic Geography colleague waved in his discovery and realization after he made a breakout from the Herta Space Station for the grand cosmos. The Interastral Peace Corporation won't sell you a word of what I'm about to say, even if you hand them a million worthless credits that you have to sell your homes to get! And do you know why? Because what I'm saying here is about freedom, rebellion and instability, things that evoke hatred from the IPC, which loathes risks and only cares about making employees mindless machines. The best the IPC can offer is to distract you with a thousand exotic wares and a thousand false choices from what truly matters. This is precisely why it attempts to please many factions. It's trying to hide the reality we live in under a facade of false prosperity and happiness. Now is the time to face the truth. When I was with the Herta Space Station, the Department of Cosmic Geography was looked down upon by all other departments. Those self-righteous biologists, politicians-to-be, fortune-telling conjurers and profiteers, all of them despised us, thinking that we were too incompetent to study anything else other than playing with stones and mud. But once you leave the Herta Space Station, you'll find that truth couldn't be further away from what they led you to believe. Our knowledge of the scale of the cosmos is on par with that of the Nameless who traverse the universe.Our desire to learn more about the geography of the universe was once blessed by the Trailblaze Aeon, who laid down star rails to connect the planets, linking the far corners of the universe, even the dark areas. The deity goes by the name of Akivili. On this coarse paper that didn't cost me a penny, I share with you the teachings THEY left us before passing away: Be proud, and look skywards. If you feel things are not going your way and that all is without purpose or that the universe is dark and cold, blow a hole out of the Herta Space Station! Make a breakout from the space station! You will find that the cosmos is yours to explore. I know this, because I have done so. Disclaimer: The content of this letter is for members of the Department of Cosmic Geography only. Don't hold me accountable if you brats from other departments try to follow suit. Former member of the Nameless, now an Armed Archaeologist of the Intelligentsia GuildHosea Lazaro Letter From the Comet Hunter (III). To old friends and enemies and new ones: Those of you who don't know who Hosea Lazaro is, feel free to ask the head of the Department of Implement Arts. I can still recall the man in charge of the Department of Implement Arts when I was a junior researcher trying my best at work. Wen Huairen was his name, the old man of Wen Mingde. Old miser really enjoyed cutting our research funds. He slashed the supply of instruments used to test the composition of atmosphere and soil on different planets and used the money to buy showy antiques from the IPC, calling it \"business exchange.\" He had an eye for rare relics. I'll give him that. He bought low and sold extremely high in the Interastral market. The Department of Implement Arts was raking in profits because of this. In the meantime, we had to make do with an Astro Rod for planetary research. Even after I hit his face with an Astro Rod, he did not change a bit. Business as usual, money for Department of Implement Arts, budget-cut for Department of Cosmic Geography. Business must have been booming for Department of Implement Arts since I left. After all, one less accountant who ran random checks and pushed for fair distribution of resources to worry about. More and more suppliers have \"Herta Department of Implement Arts\" branded on their packages. In addition to Wen Huairen, all those who bullied the Department of Cosmic Geography were taught a lesson by me, Hosea Lazaro. Many became my enemies who saw to my removal from the space station, but some turned into my friends. I'm not the most amicable type, true, and I got into a lot of trouble because of that. But Wen Tianweng was the only one who gave me a proper smack. It was on me though, I owe him that. Those old friends of mine, I know most of them are still kicking. The same goes for me. In fact, I want them to know that I have never felt better, despite the fact that I nearly kicked the bucket in the waste lands of Destruction several times. My head was wanted by numerous factions thanks to my recklessness. Years of saving wasted in Masked Fools' pub. None of those matters now. I'm alive and kicking. An old friend, or enemyHosea Lazaro"}

Martha, Do you remember Fayne? The one who went with you to catch rock crabs? Long face with eyes that made him look like he was always sleepy? I found out that he got into the ancient relic trade. He did that for a few years, but must have gotten into a turf war or something since I haven't heard anything of him lately. A while back, he uncovered some letters in the machine graveyard that he couldn't sell on the relic market. I don't know why he tried \u2014 anything that isn't a relic is worthless there. He came to me out of desperation and asked if I'd take them. I only purchase aquatic goods, not garbage. If someone brings me rock crabs, no problem, but what am I supposed to do with letters? Anyway, for old friendship's sake, I ended up buying them at a low price. Even after I bought them he was still trying to fool me. He told me they contained sales reports on aquatic goods, which is why he sold them to me and not the collectors. Out of dozens of letters, there was only one that mentioned a type of crab \u2014 the tunnel rock crab. In all my years of being in this business, I'd never heard of it before. Judging from the name, it's probably related to the standard rock crab, but maybe they're one and the same? I did hear a funny story about rock crabs. Rock crabs never used to hide in the rocks \u2014 they only started doing so to protect themselves from the hordes of people trying to eat them. Maybe that's when the crabs changed their own name? Anyway, the letter mentioned there were many crabs in the underground mining area. Left unattended, they'd cause the tunnels to collapse in less than two hundred years, along with the city above. Well, it's been a long time and nothing has changed. The only difference is all the crabs are gone now, probably extinct from all of us eating them. I can tell the people back then didn't know much. They had nothing better to do than frighten themselves all day long. If there were as many crabs now as there was back then, I wouldn't have to worry. The price of rock crabs is high, and they might already be extinct since I can't catch any. I may have to find a different job. I heard you're currently studying history in Wildfire. I came across these letters and thought they could be useful to you, so I forwarded them over. All I ask in return is that you introduce me to the chef there. What do you think? Marcel"}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=18169","text":"Letter from Fu Xuan to Scholar Yaakob Letter from Fu Xuan to Scholar Yaakob is a readable found in The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. Dear Scholar Yaakob, I hope this letter finds you well. The observation data you provided for the Luofu has reduced the casualties in Operation Nandikwa by at least 70%. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you on behalf of the Luofu's Six Charioteers. As stipulated in the agreement signed by the Six Charioteers, I will share a part of the technical writings on the Matrix of Prescience Ultima with you. To express my sincerity, I will give a brief explanation in a manner that is understandable to the guild. I believe the guild is aware that the Chaos System is an insurmountable hurdle when it comes to predicting the future. All predictions boil down to predictions on a certain type of Chaos, but Chaos itself is unpredictable. Any tiny disturbances, whether caused by changes in weather or the three-body problem, may result in fatal deviations in the prediction outcomes. The creators of Matrix of Prescience Ultima sought inspiration from the Wisdomwalker and used the idea to predict the future: there is a constant and conclusive disturbance factor behind all predictions \u2014 the observation itself. To put it simply, when we are observing a Chaos System, our observation itself will affect the final operation of the system. Now, if we treat the observation as a variable, as in observing our observations, we can derive an outcome that is as accurate as possible. Well, that is what the creators planned to do initially. When they put the amazing machine to use, something beyond everyone's comprehension occurred. The phenomenon is described more accurately in the attachment with the use of mathematical terms, but I will give a simple explanation here (which may be inaccurate): When the Matrix of Prescience Ultima observes an observation, the future it observes will come toward us and reveal itself from Chaos, though it only has a rough framework. Or let us explain it less rigorously in terms of physics: When we don't observe the future, the future that has not happened does not exist, just like the past that has happened. But if we observe the future, the future will happen in the way we observe it. Let me be more straightforward here \u2014 the way the Matrix of Prescience Ultima operates is like a black box. We know that we can derive a frighteningly accurate prediction from the Chaos system by \"observing our observation,\" but no one knows how it works nor can anyone explain it. Many, including my colleagues from the Divination Commission, consider this to be an example of how humans can change or select the future with their own power. But for me... I will interpret this from another perspective... The past, present, and future do not exist sequentially across the axis of time, but all exist simultaneously. (This statement of mine essentially denied the existence of time, so the concepts of \"sequential\" and \"simultaneous\" might be slightly inappropriate here.) Every moment in the universe has been predetermined since its creation. That is to say, it is impossible to change the future. Best regards, Fu Xuan, Master Diviner of the Luofu Divination Commission"}

The IPC claims that after the Dusk Wars is when Qlipoth ascended as the first Aeon, however many archeological discoveries have since proven that Leviathans were still active in the early days after the Preservation ascended, challenging the claim.

Having grown up on the streets, Lindsay never officially boxed in a ring until an old lady named Ekaterina challenged her, stating that if she won, the young girl would have to train under her. Too proud to use the gear given to her by Ekaterina and trusting her reflexes, Lindsay quickly lost the fight by underestimating the boxing coach and was punched unconscious. Upon waking up, she put on the discarded gear and asked Ekaterina to train her to be the strongest boxer that ever lived. Lindsay's pride would get in the way again as she trained, with her experience as a street fighter becoming a detriment as she knew only how to attack and not defend. Ekaterina arranged multiple matches that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 lost, which humbled her and forced her to listen and adopt her mentor's techniques. Being a petite person, Lindsay developed a unique footwork after Ekaterina took her to a high society ball where they danced together repeatedly.

The night before her first championship fight without Ekaterina, Lindsay wrote Ekat on the inside of her chest guard and swore to win for her.

[List of Archenemies \u2014 Ruin Scroll \u2014 Contents] ...&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; Lord Ravager&lt;br&gt; Doomsday Beast&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Voidranger&lt;br&gt; Baryon\/Antibaryon&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; [Glossary] Lord Ravager Category Their identities are not fixed and are based on species of origin. Summary A Lord Ravager is an Emanator who oversees many divisions in the Antimatter Legion, and is selected by the Ruin Author, Nanook. Despite the countless worlds, civilizations, and lives that Nanook has annihilated, THEY still leave a pathway open to delay the doomsday of some powerful victims who obey THEIR will \u2014 or who even step gleefully onto the path of Destruction. Endowed with the powers of Destruction, these creatures are twisted into dreadful Lord Ravagers. Rumor has it that Nanook has seven Overlords, each representing one of the seven extremes of Destruction. But so far, we have yet to find any specific data on these seven Overlords. Alliance observational records, corporation intelligence networks \u2014 there's barely any useful information out there on this \u2014 after all, there are no remnants by definition wherever Destruction goes, and that includes information. At least four of the Overlords remain a complete mystery, and can only be distinguished by their affinity for Destruction. Observational Records [Zephyro] With a terrifying reputation as a one-man army, Zephyro is the most passionate Overlord about violent destruction. Zephyro is obsessed with the raw power and beauty of things just as they burst open at the point of destruction. In Year 6804 of the Star Calendar, the sun of New Bethlehem was ignited, scorching its planetary surface with huge amounts of radiation and instantly turning it into glass;&lt;br&gt; In Year 7143 of the Star Calendar, a huge cyclone was stirred up, smashing the ecosystem on Aedirn into smithereens;&lt;br&gt; In Year 7658 of the Star Calendar, the Moonshield's outer shell was drilled straight through, launching an attack on the planet core that crushed the entire world...&lt;br&gt; These acts of Destruction neatly encapsulate Scorching Flare's extreme passion for doomsday scenarios. Potential threat to the Alliance: Very high. [Celenova] Celenova is the front-line general for the Ruin Author Nanook. For some reason defying logic, Celenova is Nanook's most frequently-used general. Her troops spread throughout the cosmos, weaving a network of destruction between the stars.&lt;br&gt; The Yaoqing, the Zhuming, and the Fanghu ships all have records of fighting against Celenova's minions.&lt;br&gt; is also the only Emanator of Destruction to board a Xianzhou ship. Records from the \"History of the Xianzhou\" have her requesting a ceasefire with the Xianzhou Zhuming around Year 5700 of the Star Calendar, requesting the ship to change course and assist in attacking the homeworld of the wingweavers. Potential threat to the Alliance: Very high. [Irontomb] Irontomb's modus operandi is attacking technologically advanced civilizations. All survivors \u2014 without exception \u2014 recount the same experience: A complete intellectual collapse.&lt;br&gt; In a flash, inorganic AI legions are paralyzed or turn against their mates; outer space defense arrays begin targeting the home planet; flying vehicles scatter at random like flies, unable to target the enemy... Irontomb's forte is attacking civilized worlds confident in their technology.&lt;br&gt; Recently, the Xianzhou Yuque has produced intelligence about Irontomb attacking the Baranza Forge. We must guard against his attack as soon as we can. Potential threat to the Alliance: Very high. This Overlord's name has not been clearly identified, but they have left behind observational records. Stargazers of the Yuque once produced 152 consecutive years worth of observational records about the dead planet Syracuse-III.&lt;br&gt; The Legion crept very slowly toward this front line, building up an advantage, exerting pressure, and chipping away at any resistance. Just like observing an ant colony, they watched their victim experience slow structural collapse.&lt;br&gt; Similar phenomena also occurred during the deaths of Red Babel, the Ogul ring, and others. Speculation rose that behind the scenes lay an Overlord with the calm, self-sufficient temperament of a chess grandmaster, pulling the strings of strife as it developed. Potential threat to the Alliance: Very high. This Overlord's name has not been identified, but they have left behind observational records. Based on IPC records, at least 122 planets were plunged into chaos of unknown origin over the past 600 years before their ultimate demise at the hands of the Antimatter Legion.&lt;br&gt; Corporation investigators initially leaned toward these being isolated events. But all disaster assessment reports attributed these events to a single cause: \"spiritual\" disintegration; the internal conflict of belief systems; the crumbling of spiritual pillars; the collapse of trust within civilizations; and the complete abandonment of all hope.&lt;br&gt; The Yuque's Divination Commission believed that behind these series of events lurked an unseen Lord Ravager. Potential threat to the Alliance: Unknown. This Overlord's name has not been identified, but they have left behind observational records. The Intelligentsia Guild has provided a light comparison map of the starzone around the Yvanna chain. One-third of its stars have been extinguished by some unknown force for nearly 300 years, and it is beyond reason to suggest that this has occurred naturally.&lt;br&gt; The Antimatter Legion roams freely across these worlds shrouded in darkness, raining down destruction upon this eternal nightscape. Survivors from the Yvanna system term this one \"The Sun Devourer.\" Potential threat to the Alliance: Unknown. This Overlord's name has not been identified, but they have left behind observational records. Ecologists from the Luofu's Realm-Keeping Commission once researched a strange world that has completely been converted into antimatter. All antimatter objects hurtle toward their matter counterparts, releasing a destructive dazzle upon impact.&lt;br&gt; Antimatter Legion Creations have always had distorted, twisted appearances. When destroyed, many instantly implode with an intense backfire, dragging their enemy along with them to their destruction. Perhaps this strange characteristic is derived from this unnamed Overlord? Potential threat to the Alliance: Unknown. \"\"The Cloud Knights have been created following Reignbow's edict to fight against Abominations, but so many battles were had against the Antimatter Legion since its foundation. In foreseeable future, the Cloud Knights will inexorably come up against minions of the Ruin Author, so adequate preparations should be made soon.\"\" Abomination Scroll: The Borisin. [List of Archenemies \u2014 Abomination Scroll \u2014 Contents] ...&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; Borisins&lt;br&gt; Wingweavers&lt;br&gt; Houyhnhnms&lt;br&gt; Viscorpi&lt;br&gt; Heliobi&lt;br&gt; Cobrakinds&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; [Glossary] The Borisin Category Primates \u2014 Hominids \u2014 Canine subspecies Summary The borisin are the oldest nemeses of the Alliance, and the main constituent of the Denizens of Abundance. Their planet of origin remains unknown. However, judging by genetic screen results, the borisin share a common ancestor with the Foxians \u2014 yet the two have diverged onto very different paths. Foxian epics tell how the races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. But later historical developments saw the borisin consider the Foxians as slaves or cannon fodder, fueling their desire to conquer the stars. According to verifiable Alliance records, there have been three large-scale wars between the Xianzhou and the borisin, with heavy losses on both sides. Therefore, the Cloud Knights must remain vigilant about the borisin's movements. Physiology The borisin have a distinct canine anatomical structure: Broad, slender skeletons; powerful jaws and neck muscles; well-developed fangs; pointed ears atop the skull; and sharp claws on hand and foot. Within the broad classification of long-life species, the borisin can be said to have the greatest healing ability. Alongside this hyper-healing is their ability to shapeshift (known as \"Moon Madness\" by the borisin). This ability has also been observed very rarely in some Foxians (apart from the Foxians of the Yaoqing). Shapeshifting is accompanied by intense hyperplasia of the bone and muscle structure, such as a protruded snout and jawline, and the twisting in of the foot structure. This damaging deformation process is eventually completely restored by the borisin's rapid healing ability. During battle, the borisin emit a pheromone known as Lupitoxin, which stimulates fear in the amygdala. To counteract these effects, the Cloud Knights take medicinal pellets to suppress their innate fear when in combat. Technology The borisin are particularly skilled at biotechnology, and perform various body modifications upon themselves. Borisin armor and weapons both have characteristics of living entities. Their ships are known as mechabeasts or beast ships. These are biological spaceships with the ability to feed, attack, and reproduce. The borisin's combat vessels for everyday hunting are also known for their rapid velocity. Politics The borisin have a tribal council system, with many ancient cultural traditions centering around the strong preying on the weak, or respect for force.&lt;br&gt; A single tribe is called a \"Pack,\" and a multitribal entity is called a \"Great Pack.\"&lt;br&gt; The borisin often select the most cunning and strong to lead their Pack: the Brood Lord. For a Great Pack, the leadership selection process forces the competing Brood Lords to fight each other, ranking them from top to bottom based on strength. A Great Pack leader is called \"Father Wolf\" or \"Warmuhtar\". &lt;br&gt; \"\"The last Warmuhtar, Hoolay, has been interned and now the new Warmuhtar is...?\"&lt;br&gt; \"Anecdotal accounts seem to suggest that it's Angqin or Leesa. \u2014 Qingzu\"\" Abomination Scroll: Heliobi. List of Archenemies \u2014 Abomination Scroll \u2014 Contents ...&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; Borisins&lt;br&gt; Wingweavers&lt;br&gt; Houyhnhnms&lt;br&gt; Viscorpi&lt;br&gt; Heliobi&lt;br&gt; Cobrakinds&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; [Glossary] The heliobi Category Order: Shapeless \u2014 Family: Spirit Essence \u2014 Sub-Species: Heliobus Summary The heliobi are ancient enemies of the Alliance. They are a rare species among the Abominations of Abundance, belonging to the order of Shapeless and the race of Extraneous Demons. Their original planet remains unknown. As indicated by its biological classification, heliobi are pure energy entities without a set form. Records from many civilizations have named them \"The Shapeless\" or \"Starfire Essence.\" The heliobi love to parasitize others and control bodies of blood and flesh (commonly a humanoid sentient race), experiencing through this the various alterations of the nervous system triggered by emotions. This behavior of \"emotion consumption\" satiates the shapeless heliobi. The host will uncontrollably conduct stimulating behaviors (such as binge eating, impulsiveness, self-mutilation, or destruction...) to please the heliobi within them, in exchange for the heliobi's powerful abilities. The process of heliobi taming the host's psyche is a process of expending the host's physical body without replenishment. According to \"History of the Xianzhou\", our contact with the heliobi can be traced back to the Lone Voyage Era before the Xianzhou natives turned into a long-life species. At that time, the nine Xianzhou ships sailing among the stars came into contact with various outrageous and miraculous lifeforms, including the heliobi. This race penetrated the ships' vaults to appear before our ancestors, declaring themselves a shapeless and rootless race, beseeching Xianzhou to give them a safe berth. The heliobi are adept at creating mirages and illusions to tempt humans. Thus, humans became addicted to these wondrous creatures of pure energy and indulged in frolicking with them. But they soon exposed their true colors. The heliobi tried to take humans' bodies, drain their emotions, and control their will. This is the Possession Tragedy, from which the Xianzhou Zhuming suffered the greatest. Thankfully, the Xianzhou artisans ultimately bound the heliobi within shapeless prisons and sentenced them to provide energy for Xianzhou for all eternity. This lasted till the end of the Flaming Catastrophe War against the Denizens of Abundance, when a hero broke the seal binding the heliobi, made an alliance with them, and relied on their power to defeat the army of Muldrasil*. After that campaign, the heliobi was also severely diminished. Its leaders were once again imprisoned and sealed in the various Xianzhou ships' Shackling Prisons. It cannot be ascertained whether any remnants may have escaped from the Xianzhou, but no traces of them have been found among the stars since. Physiology When heliobi appear, electrical equipment will detect some sort of highly-intensive electromagnetic wave emission. As a creature of the Shapeless order, it can avoid the emission range of visible light and disappear from human sight. However, in order for the host to notice them, they would usually appear as a ball of heatless teal \"fire.\" That is also why they are called \"Starfire Essence.\" Like how humans push physical objects, individual heliobi can also alter the energy balance of an area, freely converting energy from one type to another. Through manipulating energy, they can create visual images, make fire or ice, and produce vibration. This made heliobi appear as gods or demons to primitive civilizations. Based on the size of an individual's \"fire,\" one can judge the strength of that heliobus and how much energy it can master. As an individual heliobus possesses more and more hosts over time, it would also slowly develops a personality and become distinctly different from its kin. Records in the Ten-Lords Commission surmise that this race learns from the hosts' brains through their parasitism. Technology The heliobi have never developed any technology. They have a certain level of repulsion against advanced technical equipment due to the race's ability to manipulate energy. Politics Though heliobi are recognized as an Abomination of Abundance, they rarely appeared as a part of the Denizens of Abundance's legions. On the contrary, they had once allied with Xianzhou. (For a very short duration only. See above for the specific circumstances.) It has been at least six thousand years since the heliobi were subdued, making it virtually impossible to study its social organization. Some records indicate that individual heliobus can fuse with each other to create a bigger \"fire.\" &lt;br&gt; \"I heard the Xianzhou Zhuming has one of these demons sealed inside?\"&lt;br&gt; \"\"That's right. Folks from the Zhuming call it Flint Emperor. Actually, doesn't our Artisanship Commission still have prisons like that?\" \u2014 Qingzu\"&lt;br&gt; \"That's pretty dangerous...\"&lt;br&gt; \"\"Well, Zhuming residents do love to play with fire...\" \u2014 Qingzu\" Abomination Scroll: Wingweavers. List of Archenemies \u2014 Abomination Scroll \u2014 Contents ...&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; Borisins&lt;br&gt; Wingweavers&lt;br&gt; Houyhnhnms&lt;br&gt; Viscorpi&lt;br&gt; Heliobi&lt;br&gt; Cobrakinds&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt; [Glossary] Wingweavers Category Species: Primates \u2014 Family: Hominids \u2014 Sub-Species: Feathered Summary The wingweavers are ancient and established foes of the Alliance, and the main branch of the Denizens of Abundance. Their original planet remains unknown. According to currently available information, wingweavers reside in a living tree-shaped world named Muldrasil. Through the outstretched branches of Muldrasil, the armies of the wingweavers warp to different worlds to plunder resources and lives. In the wingweavers' culture, any terrestrial sentient races that cannot fly are called \"Residents of Dirt,\" while the wingweavers call themselves the \"Cloudlords.\" They enslave other sentient races, making these races produce resources and maintain their world tree. Based on the fragmented historical records in the \"History of the Xianzhou\", our first contact with the wingweavers can be traced back to the Primeval Imperium Era before the Xianzhou fleet set sail. \"Winged barbarians arrived from beyond the sky, slaughtered and plundered, and conducted evils uncountable. The sovereign raised armies and annihilated the invaders, imprisoning numerous magicians of the feathered ones and obtaining their miraculous recipes...\" This is the reason the Xianzhou fleet set sail. The sovereign whose name has been erased from history dispatched our ancestors to seek immortality from a god in the deep stellar seas. The wingweavers invaded the Xianzhou fleet for the second time during the Flaming Catastrophe War. They cast down their branches and almost annihilated the Luofu. If the Reignbow's Lux Arrow had not arrived and severed the Ambrosial Arbor, the war would have ended the Luofu. The Yuque's Divination Commission observed the destruction of Muldrasil at around year 5320 of Star Calendar. The Antimatter Legion destroyed the wingweavers' home almost instantly. Since then, many wingweavers have become lost wanderers in space, reduced to mercenaries and intergalactic pirates. Physiology Compared to standard humans, the wingweavers' anatomical features are more akin to that of birds. They possess highly-developed back muscles, a pair (or multiple pairs) of feathered wings, elongated feet, and powerful toe structures that can push them off the ground. The wingweavers are masters of flight, with cruise speed up to 400 kilometers per hour. Their bones and muscles contain special vacuoles that allow them to perform rapid dives and astounding bursts of acceleration. Similarly, such structures allow them to fly and move in the vacuum of outer space. (They still need to periodically leave vacuum environments to obtain air). Cloud Knights need to be mindful of the following two points when fighting wingweavers: Be weary of their volleys when fighting from a distance, and suppress their flight and mobility using our advantage in weight and stamina when fighting in melee. Technology The technology that the wingweavers demonstrated in intergalactic warfare allows us to deduce that their civilization had experienced a great decline. On the one hand, they possess \"branches\" that allow them to space warp. On the other hand, their resource supplies and weapon manufacturing are completely reliant on plundering external parties, or on trade with other Denizens of Abundance. They are found to have been equipped with the weapons and armors of borisins during all three Denizens of Abundance Wars. Politics The wingweavers allot their positions in Muldrasil strictly according to their social structure. The one residing at the topmost branch is the master of the holy celestine nest, the Wingperor of the wingweavers. Traditionally, he (or she) is considered an Emanator of Abundance. They are responsible for guiding Muldrasil's growth and making it thrive, and for nurturing all the winged people. Under them are the Sky-Defenders (the warrior class), the Hymn-Singers (the academics and secretaries), the Infant-Nurturers (the servant class), and the Bough-Pickers (the laborers). Below Muldrasil's five major castes are the Residents of Dirt, the lowest of the low \u2014 including all sentient races from other worlds that do not possess the ability to fly. As Muldrasil has been destroyed, the exact political structures of the wingweavers are no longer clear. The IPC's intelligence mentioned that all wingweavers scattered throughout the universe now belong to a certain wingweaver's mercenary company. &lt;br&gt; \"And what of the relationship between Muldrasil and the Ambrosial Arbor...?\"&lt;br&gt; \"There is no concrete evidence to indicate they are related. According to the speculations of the Yuque's Divination Commission, there might be more than one world like Muldrasil \u2014 Qingzu\"&lt;br&gt; \"\"The wingweaver's Peacock Angel legion is on the move again. Information remains to be updated\" \u2014 Qingzu\""}

Long traversed the universe an untold number of Amber Eras ago with the primary goal of seeking the meaning to life itself. At the end of THEIR life, THEY found their answer, and it became known as the Revelation of the Permanence. No one knows exactly the true ideals of the Aeon, but the penman of the Candelagraphos of the Intelligentsia Guild, Oppenheimer, came to certain conclusions. Long could have defined the meaning of existence to be the \"timeless nature of one's greatness.\" THEIR decision to reincarnate, abhorring biological immortality, also led the penman to question if the revelation postulates the \"continuance of bloodline.\" Alternatively, the decision of the High Elders of the Vidyadhara to ally with the Xianzhou Alliance signifies their inclination towards \"a noble ambition that ensures the safety of the universe.\" Appearance. Long had the appearance of a Chinese dragon, possessing a snake-like body with four limbs. Long's Scions.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=15675","text":"Long-Life Species Long-life species is a term that refers to species that have extended lifespans. Many long-life species have obtained their longevity from the blessings of Yaoshi, the Aeon of Abundance, though one exception to this is the Vidyadhara, whose longevity originates from Long, The Permanence. Long-life species are generally considered immortal but not invulnerable. Description. Long-life species, particularly the Vidyadhara, have slow rates of physical growth. They are implied to have lower neuroplasticity than short-life species. Regardless of their origin, all long-life species are susceptible to mara, a condition that deteriorates the mental state while drastically transforming the physical body. However, it is less common in Foxians and Vidyadhara, as the former usually do not live long enough for mara to develop, and the latter reincarnate before mara has a chance to develop. Some long-life species, like Foxians, have long but still limited lifespans. Xianzhou Natives are typically put down once they become mara-struck, while Vidyadhara reincarnate into different individuals and lose the memories of their past lives. The term \"long-life species\" can be used in the singular to refer to an individual that is a member of a long-life species. The antonym of \"long-life species\" is \"short-life species,\" which is used to refer to regular humans and other species without extended lifespans."}

Recently, the psychiatric department has received a lot of patients suffering from poor sleep quality. The patients attribute it to excessive dreaming, most of which were related to stress from work and life. Normally, I'd ask patients to record their dreams, which I would then analyze. Through the Dreamland, patients could learn from their mental experience, something they wouldn't have done otherwise. I've found this method helpful for treating the illness. Some would believe that the metaphors of dreams are meaningless, but I don't quite agree. Dreams can stir up patient's feelings and emotions, which, at the very least, indicates a connection with the patient's feelings or experiences. But what exactly are these dream metaphors? I've read so much about it. But the Old World literature is incomplete, and I don't have a definitive answer. What's interesting is that there is a link between dreams and reality. In the past, people have used dreams to predict the future. I remain skeptical about the saying that dreams can predict. A \"deja vu\" is when a person feels like something that is currently happening has already happened before. I believe that this is not an exact dream, but a dreamlike feeling which is just as mysterious as dreams. But \"Dream Sharing\" is one possibility. There was once a very young patient who recorded the ritual she would perform in her dreams. To my knowledge, the ritual exists only in the distant past and the people around her had no means of knowing about it to begin with. No one told her about the ritual, so how did she know about it? This is why I believe that some dreams can be affected and influenced by others. But I have no idea how this \"sharing\" and the concept behind it works. I am also reminded of one more thing. Maybe it has nothing to do with dreams of prophecy: A patient once asked me \"Is there anything real in a dream?\" The question is a hard one to answer. After all, your senses and memories are mixed together and it's hard to tell them apart in a dream. We can only admit that we know too little about the Dreamland."}

He was introduced in the Relic Set The Ashblazing Grand Duke, and first appeared in the Honkai: Star Rail Version 1.6 \"Crown of the Mundane and Divine\" Special Program. Profile. Duke Inferno is the leader of the Ever-Flame Mansion, a faction of the Annihilation Gang, and archenemy of the Jepella Brotherhood. He has four known children: Akash, Dubra, Caterina, and Constance. Appearance. Duke Inferno is a Fire Demon. He has a burning goat skeleton and wears a monocle on his right eye. His outfit is demonstrated in the Relic Set The Ashblazing Grand Duke, including the Fetora crown, white gloves, a black robe, black suits, a white shirt, a red necktie, and black and red boots. Story. Origin. Nanook destroyed a White Star named Fetora. The flames of the White Star coalesced with the power of Destruction to give birth to plasmic lifeforms. According to Dr. Ratio, the fire demon Ifrit who hails from Fetora, was born from Phase Flame. It has been obsessed with destruction and slaughter since birth. The embers left behind from the star's destruction were clasped in Ifrit's own hands, molded into the shape of Fetora's crown, and worn to this day. Ifrit, the Grand Duke, fancies himself as a conductor and wore gloves to hold the conductor's baton covered in thorns. He orchestrated countless crises bent on annihilating lives. Duke Inferno believes that \"the preciousness of something can only be appreciated in its eradication.\" He burned the historical and cultural items of the planet Lisalit. After the end of a satisfying destruction, Ifrit wipes the blood off his hands and dons pristine white gloves again, as if he was an aristocrat attending a banquet. Ifrit admires his image in the mirror after an inhuman massacre. Although the ever-burning clan of fire demons see Nanook as their emperor and savior, the Aeon has never glimpsed at them. Ifrit has never been able to grasp the essence of purity and believes the value of destruction lies in the value of the thing destroyed. Ifrit seeks the gaze of Nanook. After the fall of the Jepella Brotherhood due to the Stellaron Hunters, Ifrit grew stronger. Herta Space Station. Ifrit cast infernal fire into Herta Space Station to cause havoc by teleporting and disappearing those who were discontent with the station's leadership. His plan was foiled by the Trailblazer and Dr. Ratio, who had acquired a spark of the Phase Flame and used it to teleport those who had been kidnapped to safety. Penacony. Penacony sent Ifrit an invitation to Charmony Festival, an opportunity Ifrit wished to use to destroy the planet. However, before they could arrive on Penacony, the Ever-Flame Mansion was attacked by Acheron, who wished to claim the music box invitation they had received so she could travel to Penacony herself. Acheron offered to spare Ifrit's life in exchange for the music box, but Ifrit chose to stick to his beliefs and fight her to the death even though his children were fighting to save his life, recognizing her as an Emanator. After Ifrit's death, the Ever-Flame Mansion disbanded and parted ways, and Aventurine and Black Swan would later discover what Acheron had done."}

Every day at dawn, Salsotto's skyfishers would depart from the moving city's skyport, soaring in the air with their winged suits, hunting for phlogiston jellyfish that flew out of the sand. Phlogiston, an essential component of the Phase Flame, was the blood of the colossal moving city. Phlogiston must be sufficiently captured and gathered to ensure that the whole city could always stay ahead before the twilight zone that divided day and night. If any skyfishers died from exhaustion or were attacked by giant birds, Salsottians would spare no effort in bringing back their remains and would bury their winged suits and eagle helmets with them in the dark land. According to the traditional Salsottian rituals, \"landing\" equals death and is a symbol of eternal rest. The flight must never stop, just like how the city must never stop moving. This eagle helmet has a short condolence message carved on its beak. \"Landing is not the eagles' shackle, wings are, because of which you have to fly.\""}

Legs, being far from the heart, can only maintain their temperature when tightly strapped in fluffy feather puttees. Only at the end of the long and highly stressful hunt would an exhausted skyfisher begin to feel pain and fatigue. For those unprepared, it would be too late to discover their partial necrosis caused by severe frostbite. Therefore, skyfishers would check if they had tightened their puttees many times before taking off. After all, they wouldn't get another chance to do so in high-speed flight. They knew what the wind would take away as they stepped into the sky. Traces of lime powder and aluminum powder were found in the metal shell embedded in the puttee, which seemed to be a means of emergency heating."}

For the duration of each flight, each team member was lonely and vulnerable. All they could rely on were the 124 types of whistles that could be performed by their team captain. Hence, there had long been a saying in Salsotto \u2014 \"Skyfishers entrusted one-third of their lives to the rigorously developed technology, one-third to their ingeniously refined equipment, and one-third to their reliable lead skyfisher captain.\" Being asked by so many families to take care of their skyfisher children, the team captain constantly felt the burden of this little ring he wore.

It was no easy feat for Salsotto's skyfishers to entrap and hunt phlogiston jellyfish that flew out of the sand. During turbulent flights, the seemingly tender and soft safety harness was the thread of life for a skyfisher. Hunting phlogiston jellyfish was never easy. From trick moves to intense chasing, from precise blocking to the final capturing act, one wrong move in any one of these links in the chain could mean mortal danger. It was customary for a young skyfisher to get one strand of hair from each parent and weave them into the harness with metal supports, while a married one should get one from their spouse. In this manner, the harness would be blessed by the power of \"home\" and ensure that the skyfisher always returned safely. In this cruel world where all fought hard for survival, \"home\" was the only place that could offer comfort and support for a skyfisher. The hair inside this harness was still intact, with a faint white at the root. It came from a female."}

Since then, his parents no longer shares his letters to their neighbors to avoid another \"warning\" from the Slinkans. During his stay at the space station, he realizes that he is not a genius as he has thought. He shows disdain in his diary on the methods of scoring the researchers which causes an influx of unimportant researches in the space station. He initially researched the Wubbabboos but his research fell through and he was transferred to maintain and repair the space stations anti-gravity ionizing grid. The grid was the space station's first line of defense. So, during the invasion of the Antimatter Legion, he leaves to investigate the status of the grid despite sustaining injuries which ultimately led to his death. After his death, Wubbaboos collected his possessions to create a memorial for the once Wubbaboo researcher and caretaker."}

Ekaterina is an old woman who was well trained in boxing, and had a deceased daughter named Lindsay. She became depressed when her daughter passed, believing that she was done with the world for good until she met a street urchin also named Lindsay. She approached her with a challenge: fight her, and if Ekaterina wins she must train as a boxer underneath her. Lindsay quickly lost the fight after her pride caused her to discard the equipment given to her and she was promptly knocked unconscious. When she awoke, she kept to her word to train under Ekaterina. Ekaterina arranged a series of matches with her new prot\u00e9g\u00e9, all of which she lost, and taught her to remember her own rhythm and not fall into traps. She was a stern mentor, but looked upon her lovingly. At one point during her training, Ekaterina took Lindsay to a high society ball and taught her how to dance so she could develop how to be light and quick on her feet. At some point, she admitted to Lindsay that she had a daughter named Lindsay, and could not believe they shared the same name, before thanking her. Eventually, Lindsay fought in her first championship without her coach by her side. To honor her, Lindsay wrote Ekat on the inside of her breastplate and asked her for protection in the ring.

He died at the age of 103 due to the effects of old age. Profile. Elias is renowned for his contributions to modern cosmic communication technology. He created the Synesthesia Beacons, a machine translation device built based on Aiden's existing studies to better conduct intergalactic exploration. Alongside that, he developed ultra-long-range remote communication technology over a hundred Amber Eras ago. Elias later transferred the ownership of these two technologies to the Intelligentsia Guild for reproduction, to whom Herta certifies the rights of. Compared to other Society members, he was one of the few extroverted genius. He wished other members of the Society could come together and happily converse about their lives, loves, and dreams. For that purpose, he invented \"Society Tickets\" and designed an entire system that ensured every new member would receive this ticket even after his own death. This ticket would instantly teleport the user to a specific plane decked with festive decorations. However, while every new member after #56 had indeed used their Society Ticket, not a single one of them used it at the same time as anyone else. Story. History. Elias' invention of the remote detection challenged the Cosmos Tree theory, proposed by Zandar, Emanator of the Erudition and the first member of the Genius Society. The theory compared the galaxy to an enormous Imaginary Tree. He hoped to solve the lack of communication within the organization when he ardently prepared communication goggles equipped with ultra remote sensing capabilities for all members of the Society. However, though he succeeded in establishing a bridge between the most distant of stars, few were willing to connect. At the age of 103, Elias passed away. Although he possessed numerous methods to extend his lifespan, he made the choice to pass away from old age."}

Possessing the ability to foresee future possibilities, he uses \"scripts\" to guide his hunters in their missions. Profile. Elio is the founder and leader of the Stellaron Hunters. He is first mentioned in-game in the, as well as in Kafka's character description under her title and name. Story. Little is known about Elio's past. At some point in time, he recruited Kafka on Pteruges-V through a meticulous plan involving a canned drink. She accepted his offer after giving her conditions that caught her interest. He recruited Firefly at some point before or after Kafka. Some time passed before he sent her and Sam to find and return with Blade. He promised to bring Blade an eternal end to his life and to everything he had ever hated, earning his loyalty. He took notice of Silver Wolf after her clash with Screwllum and was present for her recruitment. At an unknown point in the past, Elio handed the Trailblazer to Kafka after seeing a future possibility where they would eventually change each other. He also told Blade that his script requires Dan Heng alive, despite his desire to kill him. In present time, Elio has predicted that the Trailblazer will eventually come to face Nanook, Aeon of Destruction. They concocted the plan to bring the Astral Express Crew to the Xianzhou Luofu, as they believe the Trailblazer will need allies when this future comes to fruition. The Trailblazer's existence also changed Elio's scripts for the Stellarons, as he would often revolve and expand around ones of particular importance, which Firefly noted he no longer followed after the Trailblazer's existence. Elio is again mentioned in Penacony by Acheron in her conversation with Sam, also calling him \"Destiny's Slave.\" In the script he gave her, Firefly would obtain \"unforgettable rewards\" in her journey, but she would experience \"death\" three times, of which the third would not come true in the most terrible form. In their conversation, it is mentioned everything is happening as Elio's script describes, even when Sam tried an easier approach that failed. According to Sam, Acheron has no mentions in Elio's script."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=13249","text":"Emanator An Emanator is a term referring to those who have attained the permission of an Aeon to draw power from their chosen Path. Confirmed Emanators by Path. Abundance. The Wingweavers allot their positions in Muldrasil strictly according to their social structure. The one residing at the topmost branch is the master of the holy celestine nest, the Wingperor of the wingweavers. Traditionally, he (or she) is considered an Emanator of Abundance. They are responsible for guiding Muldrasil's growth and making it thrive, and for nurturing all the winged people. Destruction. Lord Ravagers are selected by Nanook among those sprouting destructive impulses from worlds THEY have destroyed and brands them with a mark, granting them powers. These powerful beings obey the will of Nanook or even relish the path of Destruction. A Lord Ravager is an executor of the will of Destruction, and they implement the practice of returning all things to entropy. They command interstellar warfare, and control the might of Destruction bestowed by the Aeon. Academics believe that Lord Ravagers were elevated as emissaries of Nanook due to this absolutely obsessive and intense destructive aesthetic. Elation. Aha has no sense of self-consciousness, is utterly unpredictable, does everything on a whim, and plays mortals and the universe like a fiddle. Aha once turned a Noblesse Worm into THEIR Emanator and granted the worm fathomless intelligence. The Elation gave the entirety of THEIR Path's power to a worm that didn't even have a fully developed brain, and then discarded the creature once it had outlived its purpose. Without the Aeon's blessing, the worm died instantly and tragically. There is also an Emanator of Elation who is said to bear a resemblance \"those clowns\", likely referring to the Masked Fools. Equilibrium. HooH and THEIR Emanators influence the universe surreptitiously, trying to achieve an ideal balance. The Arbitrators admired HooH's ideas. But universal laws have no control over time and space, and mortals can only pursue the beauty of Equilibrium in a secular world by the elimination of radical extremes: with countless opposing concepts were created and interpreted to satisfy the Arbitrators' obsession with a zero-sum universe. But the rules of mortals are always riddled with flaws. Out of desperation, the Arbitrators were constantly forced over the inexorable passage of time to patch up past fallacies and mistakes, forever shifting the hopes of Equilibrium onto the next \"patch.\" HooH watches on in silence, knowing that the restoration of order could never be shaken in the slightest by such vulgar mortal drama. Harmony. The concept of Harmonic Strings is defined in the Harmony Hymns \u2014 They are the multiple embodiments of Xipe the Great One, the down-to-earth virtues that enable harmony. Regardless of whether you place yourself under The Family's rule, the Aeon will look favorably upon you as long as you carry out these good deeds. Harmonic Strings do not follow any specific individual but are facets of Xipe, and can assume the form of any Family member when necessary. Family members have returned to a system of differentiation based on scales, with only those above scale degree IV being eligible to serve as the tuner of the Harmonic Strings, such individuals are called Chordmasters. Nihility. Due to IX's complete apathy towards the universe, it never glances at anyone, so it is a common belief that it is impossible for Emanators of Nihility to exist. However, Emanators of Nihility do exist, although IX does not deliberately create them. The Nihility envelops everyone equally and only some who have gone under IX's shadow can go farther, tainting themselves with more Nihility. Nihility beckons them toward self-annihilation, yet they subtly hold its reins. Preservation. As the largest financial body of the cosmos and a disciple of Qlipoth, the Amber Lord, most believe that the Preservation's Emanators exist within the IPC. However, according to the Astral Express' current databank intel, only two Emanators of Preservation are confirmed. There is another group called the Ten Stonehearts, an elite team reporting to Diamond, who were personally selected by him and conferred with the name and status of \"Cornerstone\". Propagation. An Emanator's mandibles were directly inherited from Tayzzyronth, its death ray could fragment celestial bodies, it used its giant scythes to harvest planets for its nest, and it made shattered stars incubators for procreating offspring. An Emanator of Propagation was described as \"primitive and pure\" in contrast to other Emanators, likely due to belonging to The Swarm. Speculated Emanators by Path. Enigmata. There is evidence that History Fictionologists are a group of Emanators that were enlightened by Aeons. They often plunge into the sea of stars alone, traveling planet to planet with the sole purpose of fabricating, obscuring, destroying, and erasing the local history. Their Data Bank entry has been edited, however, making the veracity of the information ambiguous. Emanators of the Enigmata would also be capable of creating dreamscapes from memoria. The Hunt. The Generals who command each Xianzhou ship, along with the Marshal of the Alliance, take up arms themselves, embarking on the irrevocable path of pursuit, becoming the sharp arrows of the Reignbow. The Seven Arbiter-Generals possess formidable spirits bestowed by Lan and wield great power. Remembrance. As messengers for the Remembrance, Memokeepers surrender their worldly bodies and live on as memetic entities unconstrained by physical limits to traverse the universe in the form of memories. Their goal is to search the stars on Fuli's behalf to find the most precious memories, and to make sure the universe is remembered in the face of the Destruction. Memokeepers often disguise themselves as natives of the worlds they visit. They trade, copy, steal, deceive... using every means necessary to collect precious memories. They are careful not to leave any trace of their presence, ensuring that nobody remembers them, unless they come across someone with the potential to become a Memokeeper. The Emanators of the Remembrance don't have a physical body and only those they allow can see them, they would also be capable of creating dreamscapes from memoria."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=39644","text":"Emerald-III Emerald-III was a mentioned planet in \"\". Description. Culture. Emerald-III was the planet that hosted the band Sizzling Thunder, whose members and audience were comprised of youths who stayed behind, returned, or were drawn to the planet by their performance and message. Their songs include \"Cheap Salvation\", a hit from their first album,\"Our Way,\" a single from Sizzling Thunder's second album and Sid's life credo, \"Song of Sizzling Thunder\" and \"White Star\", two singles from their final album of the latter's same name. David wrote both the lyrics and the music for \"White Star\". Janis reworded her angry words during a dispute with her parents into lyrics for \"Cheap Salvation\". \"Song of Sizzling Thunder,\" was Bonham's masterpiece. They were dedicated to live their lives to the fullest while accepting their fate to be destroyed alongside their home planet. Their lyrics included \"Only cowards flee while shouting the name of the redeemer.\" from \"Cheap Salvation\", \"There's no meaning, no direction, nowhere else to go, and no future for us.\" from \"Our Way\", \"We'll burn with our life, 'cause the white star needs a spark to ignite.\" from \"White Star\", and \"Thunderclaps drown out our voice, lightning runs through our veins. We'll perish with our music and our star.\" From \"Song of Sizzling Thunder\". History. Emerald-III's star's lifespan was plunging and residents fled their home planet before the red giant exploded. Faced with a future of no escape, the elites took away hope, feigning ignorance to cries of desperation. Janis' parents paid a massive amount of credits to board the ship, helplessly praying for an interstellar salvation. The explosion of the red giant would destroy the planet, and it would collapse into a white dwarf. Before the arrival of the imminent doom, escape was the only option. Janis, the Doctor of Chaos, however, decided to try her best to face the annihilation of her home system head-on, attempting to prove that the existence of her home would never perish. As the dying sun burnt brighter, Janis took her mother's sunglasses and returned to the home planet with like-minded youngsters. The rock 'n' roll of Sizzling Thunder resounded through the planetary system, attracting involuntarily displaced youngsters to return to the crumbling Emerald-III. Lead guitarist Jimmy brought the band underground. There they sang about the tragedy of planetary destruction, which echoed throughout the entire universe. David printed the back of his leather jacket with a white star, or, more accurately, the white dwarf their star would become after the collapse. This would be their star's proof of existence. Those who left the planetary system and those who stayed behind all listened to that thunder-like rock 'n' roll and brandished the same striking symbol. Despite ceasing to exist, their presence had been remixed into the music and carved into eternity. Sizzling Thunder from Emerald-III quickly emblazed the whole planet's enthusiasm with several hits. Marking the beginning of their concert tour were the dazzling sparkles of electrifying thunder when Daeve the rhythm guitarist fiercely struck chords, which coincidentally was also worshiped by hordes of their music fans as the only light in their lives. In every concert tour the band had, there would be fans keeping order voluntarily and handing out wristbands to everyone upon entering the concert grounds. Most of these fans could not afford the costly fees for an escape, so accepting their fate and waiting for the electromagnetic burst to arrive was their only option. Ever since witnessing the return of these rebellious youths to the planet, they had felt it in their bones that their souls were ignited at this very moment. Onto these wristbands they wrote their lyrics, their showtime, as well as the band's unvoiced scream. Sid the bassist collected the wristbands for every tour. His girlfriend wove them into a bracelet, which Sid then wore all the time. Sizzling Thunder may have changed people's attitude toward finality, but they could not change their destiny. Desolation and despair were all that lay on the surface of the doomed planet. In the era of scarce resources, the band made all their albums out of discarded X-ray films. Before the long night of Emerald-III, the temperature on the planet's surface had plunged. The once unbearable air cooled down quite a bit as people walked out of their underground shelter and set out for the place where the band was putting on a show. At the final concert of their \"Thunderclap\" tour, the restless air filled with the warning signs of electromagnetic storms, and lightning was conducted through the metal scaffolding to the stage. Sparks leaped under Bonham's boots. The entire band merged with thunder and lightning. After the encore, a huge ball of lightning engulfed the stage and announced the end of Sizzling Thunder's show. After the night of their twilight show, Sizzling Thunder came to a permanent end, just like in their lyrics. Some time after the mass evacuation of the planet, the Emerald-III Migrant Charity Foundation was set up. Boothill donated to the charity but claimed he couldn't read and refused to sign. To express gratitude for his donation, Chairperson Doris and the Charity Foundation went looking for someone with connections to present the certificate to him."}

THEY thoroughly observed the actions of mortals to ensure the order of the universe, while displaying intolerance to any form of chaos or strife. Before THEIR fall, THEIR path had suppressed numerous calamities, such as the Swarm Disaster. THEIR voice is composed of syllables sequencing the rise and fall of civilizations in accordance with the Aeon's path.

An agreement was reached between the two Aeons, Qlipoth will put an end to Tayzzyronth, while Ena will help THEM against THEIR archenemy, Oroboros, by unknown means.

I quite like THEM \u2014 I don't mean THEIR personality, since I can't get along with control freaks \u2014 but I can envision an ancient and romantic universe fashioned under THEIR unique \"concept.\" The planets governed by Ena adhere staunchly to established rules, yet I must acknowledge that the various calamities in the cosmos were all hindered by Ena's guardianship, leading to extremely efficient development of civilization among diverse planets. Interestingly, however, civilizations all eventually hit rock bottom because of Order. The ancient planets that once fervently worshiped Order would shine briefly before their total collapse... Perhaps this is the \"Path\" of these planets. During the era when Ena the Order protected the cosmos, unequivocal splendor pervaded. Wherever THEIR divine traces appeared, it was always accompanied by the ethereal melodies of the Beyond the Sky Choir. These harmonious notes, meticulously arranged within a three-dimensional framework, form a holy hymn of Ena's own voice."}

The connection method is still to be discussed.3. Two Geomarrow motors have been added to ensure power, located in the base of the component.[Future improvements]1. In order to ensure that this component will not damage the power core while running, a protective cover is scheduled to be added to the Geomarrow motor. The Logistics Department will need to purchase this.2. We estimate that more Geomarrow engines will need to be added in order to offset the extra weight caused by the protective cover. \"Various suggestions from others have been posted around the frame.\" Suggestion: Could the gears be too large?Reply: Large is good.Suggestion: Maybe there are too many gears?Reply: More gears look better. Suggestion: Would the exhaust pipe obstruct movement?Reply: I don't think so. Suggestion: This thing doesn't look like a leg, it looks more like a chimney.

This is to ensure that future successors understand the developmental direction and significance of this project. Though the phase mentioned here may not achieve the expected results within the predicted time frames, the spirit behind this project must be kept in the hearts of all colleagues. This project aims to repair multiple damaged Engines of Creation \u2014 Geological Reconstruction Units, independently constructed by Belobog. These will be used to eliminate the influence of the Eternal Freeze caused by the Stellaron and renew the planet to the thriving vitality of 700 years ago. The duration of the project is expected to span ten generations. Though we are uncertain as to whether our home will ever be recovered, the courage and hope of Belobog will always be etched under the stars. Phase one: Belobog will spare no effort to collect the raw materials required for the Engines of Creations' repairs. Phase two: All components, including the four limbs, are to be constructed to prioritize the structural repair of the Engines of Creation. Phase three: The Engines of Creation are to be completely assembled. The project's focus will then move underground toward the mining of Geomarrow to refine energy sources. Phase four: Energy sources are to be introduced and the Engines of Creation will be reactivated. Transformation of the Jarilo landform is to begin. Phase five: Jarilo is restored to its former glory. Phase six: Breach into the universe and traverse beyond the blue skies. \"Thanks to technical support from the IPC, the time requirements for the project have been greatly reduced.

Before the Eternal Freeze, Belobog, led by Alisa Rand, fought a war against the invading Antimatter Legion. The Interastral Peace Corporation had a small role in the war, providing the Architects with funding to create the wall surrounding Belobog and numerous automatons for their use. However, as no one knew how to activate them, they were not used. They used the blueprints left behind to create replica automatons, though despite this, the majority of the fighters were humans. In desperation, Alisa asked the Stellaron in her possession to help her repel the invaders. The Stellaron granted her wish, enveloping the entire planet in an endless snowstorm that permanently froze the invaders but also destroyed the vast majority of life on the planet. Only through The Preservation was Belobog protected from the Eternal Freeze, and it became the planet's last remaining city on the surface.

Author: Amy Foreword Thank you, Old Goethe from the Goethe Hotel, for providing the origin of this story. Your steaming hot tea had accompanied me through nights when inspiration ran dry. For Old Goethe, Tony, and Kerry. \"I lit up all the fireplaces in the hotel. On the next day, the entire city was covered in fog.\" One Goethe left on a summer night. The stars glittered like water, but snow fell from the sky. He had told Lesley that he might still have unfulfilled wishes. She knew what it was, but she couldn't manage it. Lesley remembered that the first time she saw Goethe was at the Goethe Hotel. The well-dressed gentleman looked at her with a smile, and she saw her own reflection clearly in the caramel depths of his eyes. However, she was disheveled from her escape and was not presentable. Lesley hurriedly shifted her eyes away but the gentleman with the chiseled features did not despise her, instead offering her a cup of hot tea.\" \"Beautiful lady, how can I be of assistance?\" That was the first sentence Goethe said to Lesley. Two Goethe Hotel was indeed as the rumors said, a shelter in this world full of strife. A kind older man with a bad leg had told Lesley as she escaped here from the mines: \"Goethe Hotel is the only shelter in the entire road, because the rules here are a lot more different from everywhere else.\" And that was indeed true. Everyone in the hotel knows that while Mr Goethe appears kind, he was very famous when he was young. No matter who you are, everyone has to respect the boss and do not cause a fight in the hotel. Even though this was not a rule written out and displayed on the hotel walls, it was a hard rule obeyed by all in this border town for the past decade or so. \"Mr Goethe is an honorable man.\" People in the know found it hard to stop praising the owner of the hotel. Mr Goethe, the manager of this luxury hotel, always seemed very kind. Nobody knew where his funds came from, but everyone knew he actually charged very little with guests who are in need. For years, he had silently sheltered the poor with nowhere to go. People like Lesley. Three Lesley was originally working at a place famous for its mining industry. There were mines everywhere, and nobody knew just how many veins were still undiscovered. There were always rumors about someone discovering a vein and becoming rich overnight. Lesley had heard her work colleagues say that the owner of their mine was one such lucky soul. Thanks to the support of the various mines, the city also offered plenty of job opportunities. Lesley worked there for a few years and managed to save up some money. She sent the money home, only to receive the terrible news of her mother's death from illness a few days later. Lesley couldn't understand how her mother could suddenly become so ill. She was even more confused with how she was hunted down by a tough-looking thug when she was heading home. It was so strange. The home she grew up in, the home that sheltered her, the home that gave her so many memories \u2014 it was suddenly a forbidden place. Lesley had wanted to offer a bouquet of flowers loved by her mother at her grave, but now she couldn't even get home. The only thing that welcomed her home was the blizzard. \"*The following pages seem to have been forcibly torn off.

In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" The five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. Caelorum Venti was bound to watch over the Lunar Embryo on the Yaoqing. The Caelorum Venti Pavilion in Moon Delve is one of the most well-known tourist sites of the Yaoqing. The place commemorates how the previous Caelorum Venti fought valiantly and slew an herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the pavilion with large slabs of jade and moonstone and is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style. Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment. After the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae in the Year 7379 Star Calendar, Caelorum Venti put forward a strong case and made a deal with the Xianzhou Alliance that Dan Feng was to be spared from the capital punishment of death and instead suffer the punishment of molting rebirth, where he should have been regarded as a new being and his sins forgiven. However, the Ten-Lords Commission instead detained his next incarnation Dan Heng in the Shackling Prison, leading General Jing Yuan to banish him from the Luofu to free him from prison. At some point, Caelorum Venti sent a missive to Bailu's Preceptors, inquiring about the present status of her condition."}

It was the Candelagraphos that wrote down three paragraphs about the memories, forming three revelations. The Intelligentsia Guild was eventually able to track down the origins of each of these memories. In 2104 AE, Fomenko \u2014 a Candelagraphos scribe \u2014 obtained a mute parrot. She took great care of it, but when it died, Fomenko made quills out of the ten outermost feathers of the parrot's wings. One of these was for herself, while the other nine were stored in a vault. She used her quills to annotate for an entire Amber Era, preserving vast swathes of ancient documents on the verge of being lost. It wasn't until people went over Fomenko's legacy that they finally realized that the scribe had been writing nothing but lies with her quills. In 2147 AE, the Candelagraphos archivist Nelson arrived along with others to record the history of Penacony. During that time he would join up with The Watchmaker and document his observations and occasionally assisted with clerical tasks. Nelson disagreed with The Watchmaker's use of the Clockie cartoon to preserve Penacony's true history however he came to realize the strengths of the cartoon and how it encouraged others to read into the true history. Many of Nelson's works would be taken into the Penacony Grand Library where they now remain overshadowed by Manga and comics. At the end of his life he would give up his bodily form and become a Memetic Entity, the last of the archivers in Penacony.

The residents of the Capital of Passion are obsessed with cybernetic prosthetics, while the city's limited regulations can only advise against the frenzy of excessive body modification. Not all messengers have cybernetic prosthetic arms, but those who do often have a strong passion to modify it. After all, no one wants to have a cybernetic limb that looks identical to everyone else's. Some prosthetic arms can be specially modified, with each finger joint able to rotate at high speeds and be launched like a bullet. The registered standards for modifications in the Capital of Passion only contains three categories, with a total of eighteen types. This was not enough for the rebellious messengers. They invest huge amounts of their salaries into imaginative designs. They create blueprints that enable their electronic conversion machinery to release lightning or transform their prosthetic hands into missiles, and the designs become increasingly outrageous as fees to engage messengers skyrocket. Messenger holovisors project real-time information of the city directly onto the messenger's retina, turning impossible routes into an aerial path for the messengers: Building rooftops, air conditioning units, billboards, the arms of cranes, even unmanned logistics drones can become part of the path. Therefore, messengers must be skilled enough, as even one misstep would result in an unexpected and lethal fall. The Yellow Ducky holovisor is a discontinued old model that is said to be of considerable value among enthusiasts. Culture. The financial magnates in the Capital of Passion greedily collect and monitor every piece of information that flows in the city, whether it is important or trivial, or whether it arose from reality or virtual realms. They were used to maintaining their dominance using information monopoly, and all who try to subvert this control will be punished by the Public Security Regulation. People once protested, which only made the financial magnates dish out some convenient compromises. Soon enough, people gave up on the idea of \"privacy.\" As a result, the messengers' courier satchels have become the final bastion of privacy. The satchel is small, lightweight, and can only carry chips or documents. The limited edition Yellow Ducky courier satchel may be a bit old, but its various accessories make it still in fashion. Despite these shortcomings, the final remains of \"information independence\" in the Capital of Passion was solely ensured by these tiny blind spots. To avoid the private forces hired by the financial magnates, messengers in the Capital of Passion usually travel in the skies above the city, where security forces are scarce. They like to turn on pulse-scanning and look over the entire cyber city while chewing cheap gum and donning heavily modified holovisors. As described on the Capital of Passion infomercial channel, as the Capital of Passion had entered its 4th era, food can almost be preserved forever. Thus, the citizens are curious about how expired food tastes. It was questioned whether or not messengers were running to protect information, or to earn exorbitant fees, and why people still transmitted information outside of the internet in the prosperous Capital of Passion. Insidiously, the \"information independence\" that messengers protected became a monopoly. Insidiously, the risks that messengers faced became a bargaining chip. Insidiously, messengers became the accomplices of conspirators. The financial magnates did not destroy the messengers \u2014 It was their immature ideas that betrayed them. The messengers assembled before everything totally spiraled out of control, and bid a last farewell to their hurried lives. Most messengers wouldn't leave their name or even a trace in this city, making their behavior nothing but a self-indulgent coda.

The game was created during the Primeval Imperium Era, but it has been subsequently lost. Eventually, its rules and blueprints were found again by an anonymous diviner in the Divination Commission's repository. Then, she contacted a man from the Artisanship Commission to create the tiles and board needed to play the game. The man would also become the owner of the Quatraboard Games Parlor. Afterwards, the game would quickly become extremely popular on the Luofu, with some praising its intellectual properties, and some claiming that it is addictive and a waste of time. Its popularity lead to some publications being made about it, including a game technique manual,, and a free-to-play Foxian Immersia adaptation for Jade Abaci titled \"Viridian Soul\". As of today, there are several known Celestial Jade game parlors on the Luofu, two located in Exalting Sanctum (one ran by Ruoyue alongside her divination shop, and one near Synwood Pavilion), and one in the Aurum Alley (by Artistry Hardware). Additionally, it is known that a parlor named Quatraboard Games Parlor exists, though it is unknown if it is any of the aforementioned parlors. On one occassion, an owner of a game parlor lost all his money playing against Tingyun. Gameplay. Celestial Jade is a luck-based game based off celestial phenomena, astrophysics and astronomy, played with four players, using 144 tiles. The game is involved with gambling. The boards used to play the game are typically plus-shaped and tend to have an auto-shuffling function. Outside of the traditional multi-player experience, stacking the tiles may be a single-player alternative way to use the tiles and board, and has been recommended by Bailu to improve wrist flexibility after a sprain."}

Feeling like he was being controlled and followed by the IPC, he decided to escape and asked Screwllum for help. Chadwick suggested Selective Blocking Agent to block parts of his own memory and consciousness.

Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Is it because that guy is harassing you again? I'll go find him in a few days! Some advanced researchers really are bullies. Some Lv. 2 Researcher: No, it's not as simple as just one person. Some Researcher: Did they bring a group to ostracize you? I hate that kind of grouping cliques the most! This is no longer just for you, it's also involving my principles now! Some Lv. 2 Researcher: No, it's not really like that. But I really ran out of ideas. If I really can't deal with it, I might be demoted to the Disposal Site. Some Researcher: We're brothers, alright? If you run into problems, I will help you even if I had to make some sacrifices. Some Lv. 2 Researcher: That's great, I knew you're different from all the other advanced researchers. It all comes down to not having enough budget to do many of the studies. Some Researcher: Trust me, every researcher who worked at Herta will have faced a problem like yours. I'll be honest, many young researchers wouldn't be able to make it through this issue. Some Lv. 4 Researcher: But you don't have to worry, because I will try my best to help you. These are my experience, hope they can help you. Some Lv. 2 Researcher: I'm paying full attention. Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Firstly, the most important part, we need to maintain our original intention \u2014 as a researcher, we reject the idea of forming cliques! Those who seek fame and those who seek knowledge are different to the core! The core of what we do is to distinguish ourselves from external persuasions. Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Secondly, the funds. As the saying goes, good wine needs no bush. If you have the ability, you won't need to worry about the funds allocation. Let's look at the logic of allocating budget: The more results you contribute, the greater amount of funds you receive. So you just need to produce enough results to solve this issue! Some Lv. 2 Researcher: That's right... Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Finally, how to obtain results. Beginner researchers would inevitably take the path with more twists and turns, so the best way to avoid that is to join a project with an existing framework or two. I told you, I will help you to the best of my abilities. It just so happens that I have a major project that passed the review board. Some Lv. 4 Researcher: If it succeeds, funds would be the least of your problems. However, there's another group of fame-seekers who are trying to rob me of the core researcher title. I don't care about the title, naturally, but I didn't expect the results of the selection would have an impact on the progress of the project... Some Lv. 4 Researcher: I'm already behind on the core researcher voting selection, but if we put in some effort to vote, I might still have a chance! Some Lv. 4 Researcher: I'll send you a link, it'll automatically recognize your researcher ID so you don't have to log in manually. Some Lv. 4 Researcher: Are you still there?

Behind the scenes: After a two-year hiatus, Catherine the genius composer surprised the theaters with her new opera masterpieceAuthor: Olsen, journalist of \"Belobog Weekly\" Two years ago, Catherine easily won the Goliards Award with her very first piece of work, thus becoming the youngest winner of the Goliards Award for Best Orchestrations in a Play. This talented composer did not accept any offers from any directors or theaters. However, she shut herself off from the world at the height of her popularity and spent two years focusing on her new work. As it turned out, Catherine's latest masterpiece \"Citizen Alexandra\" proved to be a sensation when the initial draft was introduced to the public. Theaters and musicals loved this talented composer's new work. To everyone's surprise, Catherine chose a new performer to play the female lead. \"\"Citizen Alexandra\" is a story driven by a female protagonist. The supreme guardian can also show her warm and vulnerable sides. I hope that the audience can understand the journey the guardian went through her life, transforming from vulnerability to the Path of Preservation. That's the reason that I chose a new performer,\" Catherine explained to us. The one in Catherine's mind was Dasha, for whom it would be her first time as a female lead on stage. \"Although in this play, Alexandra will reveal her female elegance and a unique charm, she is always the Supreme Guardian in her people's hearts, which means she had to change. She had to transform from a tender rose to an unbreakable rock. As for Dasha, her personal experience honed her voice to be able to showcase this aspect.\" Catherine said with a smile that she was very grateful for the trust of the director and producer in letting her decide the female lead. The cooperation between Mia the director and Catherine the composer was a surprising success. The play \"Citizen Alexandra\" had not been shown to the public, but in the previous trial shows that only opened to professionals and the media, this musical combining many popular songs was greatly praised by the audience. With the new singer Dasha's beautiful voice, not only did Alexandra the Supreme Guardian show the tenderness of a teenage girl, but also perfectly presented her determination and selflessness as she chose the Path of Preservation accompanied by three male friends. \"Blizzards may tear me apart but can also make me who I am. It's your love that help my heart always be as unbreakable as a rock.\" Before the official show starts, Dasha sang us a small part of the Alexandra theme song. In a few lines, the legendary life of the supreme guardian has been presented vividly.

This moment is finally here. Before I entered the dream today, the shift lead found me and had a long earnest chat with me. He spoke too fast, and I couldn't catch most of what he was saying, but I still sort of understood what he was trying to tell me: He feared that I would be \"in grave danger\" when I entered the dream this time. If I can't complete the mission successfully, The Family will surely banish me from their ranks. He even said that he really appreciated me, that there were few young people like me who were this low-profile, hardworking and industrious, and he hoped I would pass the trial without a hitch. I exchanged a few perfunctory words with him, then went back to my room to prepare to enter the dream. It'd be a lie if I said I wasn't the least bit anxious \u2014 but what else could I do besides mutely accepting the current situation? I closed my eyes and forced myself to take a nap, the dreamless kind...To be able to do that thing, I would have to be in optimal condition \u2014 physically and mentally \u2014 no matter what. Part II. I entered the dream and woke up in the Reverie's staff dorms like usual. But the feeling of everything around here was oddly strange. The people around me seemed to notice something, and I felt that their gazes cast toward me were somewhat peculiar \u2014 of course, it could've all just been in my mind, but who knows? Someone who wasn't very acquainted with me on most days suddenly slapped me on the shoulder, like he was trying to encourage me... But I didn't even remember what he worked as. A Dreamscape Motivator? Damn it. It was like my memories were erased by someone... Jeremy and I traded a few lines, mostly about those recent strange happenings in the hotel in the Dreamscape: Paintings suddenly appearing, musical instruments attacking guests and such \u2014 it all made me somewhat nervous. You know, it's strange, he was the closest to me, yet it felt like he completely didn't know what I was about to face today... I even forgot to tell him before. It's fine. This is good too \u2014 one person fewer to worry about. I changed into a jet-black outfit. Black makes me feel safe. I waited for a while at the dorms, so anxious that I couldn't even sit still. God knows how many times I paced the room. And then, I heard a knock on the door. Part III. This was still so surreal to me \u2014 I finally had a chance to meet face-to-face with THE Lady Siobhan... She is a prominent figure among the Iris Family, her position only second to the Head. I heard from others that she preferred solitude, and seldom showed herself. To think she was going to be appearing under such circumstances, and to interact with a lowly lackey like me... I was extremely nervous initially with all my words stuck in my mouth. But Lady Siobhan's words had a certain charm to them, which quickly settled my nerves. She explained plenty of important matters to me: That the hotel in the Dreamscape was recently experiencing anomalies, the efforts that The Family made to combat this phenomenon, what us attendants should be watching out for, etc. etc... She was extremely fastidious in her elaborations, and even I was miraculously alert, absorbing every single word that she uttered. Finally, Lady Siobhan told me that, in the face of unprecedented disaster, every Iris \u2014 nay, all Family members had to be prepared to draw their weapons. To protect our guests' interests, we had to stand between them and every horrific event that could present the slightest threat... To be honest, I really didn't know if I was ready. Part IV. I did it! Praise the Great One. I managed to secure my job \u2014 I could even call myself an Iris! The entire ordeal was intensely harrowing. I tried three times, failing within five seconds on the first two... But with a final attempt, it was a miracle that I actually pulled through! Relying on some meager strength of Harmony, I resonated my thoughts with that blasted plate, and that disgusting piece of sponge! I held on for twenty seconds, successfully making that plate spick and span! I even used my telekinesis to turn the tap on, and rinse the lingering soap bubbles on the plate! All around me were applauding, and I thought I spied Lady Siobhan from the periphery of my vision. Having completed this step, I wouldn't just be some insignificant trainee any longer... I was now a proud member of the Iris Family! Now and forever!"}

Aurumatons are highly intelligent humanoid robots often used for security and military purposes in the Alliance. Aurumaton Gatekeepers are garrison units employed to guard important places. The Ten-Lords Commission employs Aurumaton Spectral Envoys as law-enforcing units and no authorities of the mortal realm have jurisdiction over them. History. Aurumatons have been part of the Xianzhou ever since the Primeval Imperium Era, before the ships departed from their ancient planet. They were tasked to oversee humanity and aid them with warfare. After the unnamed sovereign united the planet, they replaced security institutions with Aurumatons and Ingenia to maintain public order. During a period of time, starting around Year 1400 Star Calendar and finishing with the Heliobi Wars, the Xianzhou people took control of the ships from the Aurumatons. In December of Year 3278, the Aurumatons were influenced by Rubert I and revolted against the Xianzhou people. An Aurumaton named the \"Zhige\" Protoype, a weapon designed by the Primeval Imperium for warfare, initiated the rebellion. Citizens of all social classes were killed indiscriminately. The rebellion lasted for several years and ended in July 3292, with the last of the Aurumatons being subdued. Following the rebellion, most of the Aurumatons were suppressed with talismans, stripping them of the ability to \"think.\" The few that retained their awareness had records of that era erased from their jade abaci modules. The Xianzhou Xuling is filled with Aurumatons, but not living beings. The Xuling acts as a mobile dock that provides supplies and maintenance services for other Xianzhou ships for supply and maintenance. Aurum Alley in the Xianzhou Luofu is named after Aurumatons. Aurumaton President is the president of the Aurum Alley Merchant Guild. Artistry Hardware in Aurum Alley, currently owned by Mr. Xiao, remains one of the few proud workshops able to independently craft and maintain Aurumatons in the Luofu."}

Automatons are deployed in Belobog for many purposes, including mining, construction operations, transportation, and military combat. The majority of people in the Underworld regard robots as nothing more than tools. However, some people keep Automatons as pets. They make modifications to their pets, which they call pet upgrades. They formed a small community to share ideas. Some are interested in nurturing robots. Others force them into battle. Compared to other mechanical lifeforms in the cosmos like Aurumatons, Ingeniums and Intellitrons, the Jarilo-VI Automatons have a short history and a rather basic level of intelligence. Only a few like Svarog have developed advanced intelligence and emotions, and the evolution of Jarilo-VI Automatons has sparked the interest of Screwllum. The modern mech of is similar to, but its weapons and armor are more advanced than the Jarilo-VI replica. History. More than 700 years ago, the IPC concealed the original mech weapons within the towering rock formations in Old Weapon Testing Ground. When the Antimatter Legion invaded Jarilo-VI, the IPC departed from this world, and no one had possessed the necessary knowledge for activating these weapons. Therefore, the Architects used the IPC blueprints to construct replica Automatons as known today. However, the overwhelming majority of the combatants, commanded by Alisa Rand, were human. Svarog was originally Monitoring Automaton Prototype 3 from the great war. During Svetlana Rand's office, Svarog became Dr. Mearsheimer's personal robot bodyguard and recorded the Stellaron research data. After Dr. Mearsheimer and his assistants passed away, Alexandra Rand retrieved Svarog. Later, Svarog was deployed in the Underworld to protect the Geomarrow Development Group and the Furnace Core Research Station. Svarog has developed a network in the Underworld so Automatons connected to the network will follow his management. Vagrants from the underground have formed settlements around the Furnace Core of their own accord. Robot Settlement has become the place where a rapport between humans and robots can be seen. After Bronya and the Astral Express Crew were sent to the Underworld by Sampo, they fought and convinced Svarog to unseal the Furnace Core. Svarog agreed to reveal the Stellaron data and records, which convinced Bronya to confront Supreme Guardian Cocolia. When Topaz arrived at Jarilo-VI to collect the debt owed by the Architects from centuries ago, she brought the source code in case she needed to take control of all Automatons in Belobog. Svarog had to bring her to Old Weapon Testing Ground as she requested him while revealing the source code. When Gepard was ordered by the now Supreme Guardian Bronya to garrison in Rivet Town with Silvermane Guards and Automatons to stop the IPC's infiltration, she used the source code to seize control of all their Automatons in an instant and broke through Gepard's defense. She learned the origin of Automatons from Svarog after they stopped at Old Weapon Testing Ground. As she eventually reached consensus with Bronya and invested in the revitalization project of Jarilo-VI, she entrusted the source code to Clara."}

They were comprised of members of the Avgin race and worshipped Gaiathra Triclops. Eventually, the clan suffered a massacre by the Katicans during the Kakava festival. It is suspected that Aventurine is the only living survivor of the Avgins. Description. Individuals of the Avgins possess attractive facial features, unique beautiful eyes, and high emotional intelligence. Although these features enhance their charisma, they are also causes for jealousy and hatred from others. As a result, the Avgins face prejudice and defamation to the point they've become infamous, with some describing them as liars, social manipulators, and two-faced thieves. Culture. Contrary to some other civilizations, the Avgins follow a religion removed from the Aeon belief system. Their Mother Goddess is known as Fenge Biyos or Gaiathra Triclops. The Avgins believe SHE is the goddess of fertility, travel, and trickery. The Mother Goddess is often depicted as a left palm with three eyes. The Avgins worship their goddess through spoken prayers alone, as they believe that more pompous means of worship do not reflect HER humble nature and only serve to distance them from HER. \"May the Mother Goddess thrice close her eyes for you, keeping your blood eternally pulsing.May your journey be forever peaceful and your schemes forever concealed.\" The Avgins see the world through the body of their Mother Goddess, believing that landmarks are merely parts of HER body. According to them, on the last day of each calendar year, the Mother Goddess' body must perish to be reborn the next day. Thus, they celebrate the first day of the new year through a festival known as the Kakava Festival. The Avgins also show fondness for well-made patterned fabrics and jewelry made of precious gemstones, especially turquoise meteorites, whose beauty rivals that of the Mother Goddess' divine body. Additionally, the Avgins understand the benefits of friendship and value trickery. History. Due to Sigonia-IV's harsh environmental conditions, only a small number of intelligent civilizations are able to survive on the planet. The inhabitants of Sigonia are known as Sigonians and share a common language. Despite this, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with many sharing a vendetta against one another. Until the IPC's intervention, they participated in numerous wars between each other. Among these clans are the Katicans and the Avgins, the rivalry of which lasted Amber Eras and once even led to a bloody conflict known as The (First) Katica-Avgin Extinction Event. When the IPC's Marketing Development Department arrived on Sigonia, its head, Oswaldo Schneider, led an operation that established a compromise known as \"Sigonian Sovereignty\", which united the Sigonian clans and allowed them to expand interspatially. The IPC then granted the newly-formed political entity a legislative seat at the Interstellar Congress. However, due to the other clans' prejudice against the Avgins and the Katicans, the two clans were excluded by other Sigonians from the compromise and, instead, through a parliamentary decision, were banished to the desert. Additionally, the Sigonians used the opportunity to promise Avgins autonomy, thus removing themselves from the responsibility should any conflicts occur between the two clans. Second Katica-Avgin Extinction Event. Years after the banishment, the Avgins and the Katicans continued their disagreements. Eventually, the Katicans began to plan a mass genocide due to their vendetta against the Avgins, who, upon realizing this, requested help from the Marketing Development Department, to which they agreed. The genocide was planned to take action on the day of the Kakava Festival. Despite their promise to aid Avgins against the war, on that day, the Marketing Development Department failed to participate. As a result, thousands of Avgins were killed or went missing, marking the end of the Avgin clan."}

She was a member of the the Nameless and part of the High-Cloud Quintet. She was proficient in using a recurve bow. History. Baiheng was born in the most renowned of the Yaoqing's Foxian adventuring flying families. Her parents were established scholars and adventurers, and she naturally inherited the spirit of the Nameless to travel and see the stars. However, she never had the opportunity to board the Astral Express. She was the author of the famous travelogue \"\". Baiheng was once assigned to a delegation to request arms and reinforcements from the Xianzhou Zhuming, for the Yaoqing's Crane Feather Orbit Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the borisin. There, she met Yingxing, apprentice to Master Huaiyan of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission and General of the Cloud Knights, who escorted the delegation to Flamedisk Forge Palace. Along the way, she gave words of encouragement to the shy and insecure boy whom she started calling Little Yingxing, and he opened up about his past to her. Once there, Huaiyan was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Helm-Master Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel. As a starskiff pilot and member of the High-Cloud Quintet, Baiheng was skilled in both combat and navigation. She was once said to have loosed three arrows simultaneously from her bow in a dire situation, while continuing to pilot her starskiff with ease and even laughing freely with her companions. She seemed to be a free-willed person, not caring whether or not combat formations were orderly. Despite being an ace pilot, Baiheng was secretly nicknamed the \"Starskiff Killer\" by members of the Sky-Faring Commission, due to the incredible amount of times she crash-landed starskiffs on different worlds. Her missions often landed her in dangerous situations, yet she always had the fortune to turn the tide and escape in one piece. Baiheng also had an uncanny ability to predict future events, specifically inauspicious ones \u2014 because every ill omen that she voiced came true, very few Cloud Knights had the courage to accompany her on missions. Her upbeat, peppy demeanor made her well-liked amongst the other members of the High-Cloud Quintet. She became especially close with Jingliu, often sharing wine that Baiheng brought back from her adventures and stargazing together, with Jingliu noting that her presence made her childhood nightmares and trauma more bearable. At some point, Jingliu made a promise to Baiheng to \"cut down the stars in the sky.\" Sometime before the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, the Abundance Emanator Shuhu rallied a great army of the Denizens of Abundance to attack the Xianzhou Alliance. Baiheng, in her typical headstrong fashion, charged ahead and shattered the enemy's defenses, allowing the other Xianzhou soldiers to break through Shuhu's Sanguinary Abyss and awaken Dan Feng from his Dragon's Delirium. She sacrificed herself to save the lives of Jingliu, Dan Feng, and countless others on the battlefield, using a \"sun\" of absolute darkness that ground everything around it into the finest dust. She was dragged into a vortex of raw power, leaving only a tuft of her hair and a few drops of blood behind. Dan Feng could not accept Baiheng's death and sought to use the Transmutation Arcanum as a means of resurrection, with Yingxing assisting him using Shuhu's flesh. Their tampering with the Transmutation Arcanum and the powers of the Ambrosial Arbor resulted in the creation of a draconic abomination, which wrought great destruction until it was defeated by Jingliu, though the ordeal left her mara-struck. This disastrous incident would come to be known as the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, and led to the final dissolution of the High-Cloud Quintet. The Baiheng Street in the Yaoqing is named after Baiheng."}

Before the long night of Emerald-III, the temperature on the planet's surface had plunged. The once unbearable air cooled down quite a bit as people walked out of their underground shelter and set out for the place where the band was putting on a show. At the final concert of their \"Thunderclap\" tour, the restless air filled with the warning signs of electromagnetic storms, and lightning was conducted through the metal scaffolding to the stage. Sparks leaped under Bonham's boots. The entire band merged with thunder and lightning. After the encore, a huge ball of lightning engulfed the stage and announced the end of Sizzling Thunder's show.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=312","text":"Belobog Belobog is a city located in Jarilo-VI. It is divided into two regions: The Overworld and The Underworld. History. Most historians hold the opinion that the War of the Gods from millennia ago marks the start of Jarilo-VI's planetary history. The wars fought between the eleven Perun States and the Veles Union Army scorched the land for years until an early spring drastically turned the tide of the war in the Veles' favor, thus granting them a total victory. They then sang praises of the spring war god Jarilo for helping them eliminate their archenemy and went on to write a poem in the same name to celebrate these lands. The planet's current name in the galaxy's records \u2014 Jarilo-VI \u2014 might be a mistranslation of the name of a stanza in this poem. When the War of the Gods was over, Jarilo-VI welcomed a long period of peace, enabling them to develop from a hunter-gatherer society to one that could conduct spaceflight. Unfortunately, there simply weren't enough resources on the planet to support its rapid development. While it was advancing in technology, it was also accelerating its own demise. Resource depletion, the advent of Stellarons, and the descent of the Eternal Freeze... One calamity after another eventually annihilated Jarilo-VI's glorious but short-lived civilization. Those who survived the Eternal Freeze were reduced to refugees who could only cower in corners, subsequently losing all memory and records of their planet's former name, Jarilo. To shelter themselves from the cold, they built a sanctuary city known as Belobog, and thus managed to pass down the torch of civilization in this way. Due to its isolated and hazardous natural environment, Jarilo-VI lost contact with other worlds after the emergence of the Cancer of All Worlds. When the Astral Express arrived at Jarilo-VI, a group consisting of the Trailblazer, March 7th and Dan Heng ventured to the surface and discovered there was still a civilization fighting against the Stellaron's remnants, the Fragmentum. Throughout the Trailblaze Mission, the Astral Express successfully seals the Stellaron, though the Fragmentum still exists and poses a threat to the people of Belobog. Belobog would later reconnect with the rest of the universe after the IPC discovered that civilization still existed on the planet."}

Description. Thousands of years ago, Jarilo-VI's climate was balmy year-round, and ocean vistas that were the envy of all. Sweet fruits dangled upon boughs in the forests and humid warmth was brought by the tides, while ambrosial wine overflowed like springwater for all to partake in. The locals were full of vigor and ambition, constructing roads, cities, seaside villas, and palaces of grandeur. Their rich and satisfactory life always started with a cup of hot coffee in the morning, and ended with a jug of malt brew at dusk. Soon, the star rail connected with Jarilo-VI's world, bringing in interstellar trade and extra-celestial technology. In the beginning, otherworldly visitors came in pursuit of Geomarrow. This crystal clear mineral contained energy that served as the lifeblood of industrialization, and their amber-colored reflections sparked with the Preservation's light. Later, visitors came here to settle and live a peaceful life. Jarilo-VI's picturesque bays, palm trees, and joyous melodies made it a perfect destination for any tired traveler. People believed that, given time, this humid planet would shine as bright as any other planet of renown throughout the galaxy. About a thousand years ago, a Stellaron fell through the atmosphere and landed on this world. Immediately thereafter, the planet was plunged into chaos, like something out of an utterly absurd farce. The Destruction's catastrophic Legion descended from the sky, and the flames of war surged across the lands. The Architects built defensive walls and fortifications, and hundred-meter constructs contended with draconian monstrosities... Then, an unending cold front suddenly appeared, and a chilling blizzard swallowed friend and foe alike. The whole planet was shrouded in utter silence, with an invisible spatial barrier covered a single fortress city, like the flame of a candle being protected in a person's embrace during a cold night. That was how civilization survived. Later, this city was to be named Belobog."}

The Architects had great hopes for Jarilo-VI before the calamity. Mimicking Qlipoth's power, the Architects created machinery that could terraform planets. Hundreds of fire-breathing Engines of Creation roared across the land, like giant gardeners cultivating abandoned flower beds. Mere decades later, valleys and hills were remade into plains and forests, and cities were thickly dotted along the coast. After the arrival of The Destruction's omen, the Architects sent all their machines into war, making them the first guards of the \"Iron Defense.\" Following the arrival of the Stellaron, soldiers of destruction landed like moths to flame, leaving tracks of desolation on the planet's surface. The machines once used for creation were now forced to become weapons of war, throwing their iron fists on battlefields where they didn't belong. Eventually, the giant gardeners fell to the ground in exhaustion like tombstones of a civilization, marking the gradual collapse of the defense line. On the day when there was no more room for retreat, Silvermane Guards held tightly onto their weapons, for their homeland was mere steps behind. The arrival of the Eternal Freeze came as a surprise to everyone. The monsters from beyond the sky and the soldiers on the front lines were trading lethal blows when snow and ice filled up the whole battlefield. In utter chaos, Belobog became the only light in the whole world. The two sides fell into endless slaughter to either sniff out or protect this light. Roaring the name of Alisa Rand, the Guards re-entered into the snow storms and never returned. The residents of Belobog only dared to climb up the city walls to look out when the blizzard halted. And they beheld the final guards of the \"Iron Defense.\""}

When it comes to eating the Belobog sausages, everyone has their own opinion. Here, we've compiled a list of your favorite ways to eat it. Which type is your favorite? The first way is to eat it as is. The sausage itself is already cooked and has been processed in many ways. It can be eaten as a snack or as a side dish. Its original taste alone is already delicious! The second way is to cook it with hammer peppers. The sausage can be stir-fried with many vegetables, but hammer peppers are undoubtedly the best choice. Stir-frying causes the aroma of the sausage to complement the strong fragrance of the peppers, allowing for a more unique flavor. The third way is to grill it. Cut across the sausage before putting it on the grill. Served with spices, it's great as street snack. The fourth way is to wrap it in suncakes. Make a suncake wrap by adding thin slices of the sausage. This method not only enriches the taste of the suncake, but also balances out the sausage's flavor. Well worth a taste! Over the years, upgrades to the process and machinery have greatly improved production capacity. The fat but not greasy characteristic is unique to this sausage. Its original delicious taste has been retained, and various flavors are now available for consumers to choose from.

The Thirty-Year Commemorative Performance of \"Beneath the White Cloak\" Is About to Start! Here Are the Three Unmissable Moments in the ShowAuthor: Olsen, Journalist of \"Belobog Weekly\" With a dazzling cast never before seen, the Golden Theater recently drew up the curtains for the powerful thirty-year commemorative performance for \"Beneath the White Cloak\"! Apparently, the number of citizens queuing up for tickets had repeatedly blocked key roads in the Administrative District, ultimately getting the Silvermane Guards to come out to maintain order. The suspense musical \"Beneath the White Cloak\", famous throughout Belobog, is the longest running show in the history of the Golden Theater. As we anticipate the thirty-year commemorative performance, we review the three unmissable famous scenes in the history of this show. 1. The mysterious white silk and crystal petals that fall from box number five When the Lady in White first appears, a very mysterious and delicate white silk will fall from on top of box number five. Hand-made crystal petals will also fall with the silk. In previous and popular versions of the show, the silk usually falls at a speed of 2.5 meters per second. The hand-made flower petals are specifically dyed to reflect marvelous colors under the light. Importantly, out of all the official merchandise sold in the theater for \"Beneath the White Cloak\", the crystal petals are the most popular \u2014 The cast also do not prohibit the audience from taking the petals with them. For over thirty years, this had been the unspoken agreement between the audience and the production cast. In fact, the thirty-year commemorative production had declared they had more than six thousand crystal petals prepared for every performance. 2. Count David's Proposal: The Omnipresent Lady in White When Count David publicly proposes to Lareina, the most fascinating part is not the seemingly romantic love story between the lead characters, but the unpredictable re-appearance of the Lady in White. In the initial version of the performance, the Lady in White suddenly appeared in the audience. As the Golden Theater became more technically advanced, the Lady in White's re-appearance became more mysterious and epic. She could walk out from the reflections of countless mirrors on the stage, and could also rise slowly from beneath the floor boards under the candelabra in the middle of the audience after a loud bang and copious amounts of fog. The technical department of the Theater designed a set that can only be moved with twenty people in order to create the mystery of the Lady in White. This had satisfied the audience for the past decade, and also gave rise to a minigame popular amongst theater-goers \u2014 can YOU guess where the Lady in White is going to appear during a particular performance? 3. An all-star finale sang by established and upcoming actors The final chorus is the closing act for all actors in the theater within the show. The protagonist Lareina is only an upcoming character, while Rebecca stands in the audience and they gaze at each other. In the story, the protagonist silently leaves the stage as the leading actors sing together. However, \"Beneath the White Cloak\" had influenced generations of musical talent in the past thirty years. At the end of the story, the final song \"Sleepless Night\" was just meant to be a collective performance, but the wide appeal of the show gradually became the collective memory of generations. Nowadays, the \"temporary actors\" appearing on stage at the final song are usually very established actors, or even past leads in older renditions of \"Beneath the White Cloak\". Various famous actors in the musical scene would also make sudden appearances in this ending show. For the audience, this is an absolutely must-see moment, a sparkling scene that will get you your money's worth \u2014 who can say no to the joy of trying to count how many famous actors are on the stage at the end? Page Three. \"The thirty-year legendary musical\", Beneath the White Cloak \"Will officially begin its commemorative performance at the Golden Theater on February 21.\" \"Limited tickets and merchandise will be available at the counter.\" Binder with the cover of \"Beneath the White Cloak\" The cover of the binder is printed with the poster of \"Beneath the White Cloak\" The size of the binder perfectly matches the size of the program, with a great storage capacity of 30 pages.

Text. Black Market Dealer Investigative Notes (I) It all started a long time ago, back when I first met him. It must have been the last Denizens of Abundance War when I first started seeing the black market dealer in refugee camps. At the time, he was dressed in what could only be termed as suspicious \u2014 a huge hood over his purple face mask, and a massive backpack strapped to his back completely out of kilter with the rest of his body. He hid among the refugees, quietly peddling some wares of unknown origin \u2014 like weapons from interstellar pirates. I struck up a conversation with him, and this man hardly kept his secrets to himself \u2014 not only did he flog some weapons to me, but he even promised to offer me some \"mods.\" In other words, weapons mods. I was vigilant at the time, as my professional instincts were screaming at me that this person wasn't a good bloke. But I couldn't stop myself from asking more questions. He grumbled to me about being considered a \"profiteer\" by the refugees around him. \"To support my family, I came here without even taking out any life insurance. Is my life really that worthless? I came here to help everyone.\" He pointed to eggshells on the ground, telling me how some loose refugees would even pelt him with eggs and how his \"kindness\" had not gotten the respect it deserved. I asked about the prices of wares (mainly those weapons of his), and indeed they were surprisingly expensive. Probably not many refugees could afford that. When asked about this, he retorted \"An optimist invests in the future. It's no use worrying about money, because if you don't use it now, you'll sure be spending it in the future...\" This guy keeps having this grim sneer, and it's starting to creep me out. Leaving the refugee camp, I reported him to the Realm-Keeping Commission. Unregulated market operations are always a violation of laws and ethics. Based on the report from the Realm-Keeping Commission, the black market dealer should've been caught. And yet the past few days, I've been seeing him again over at Aurum Alley. Black Market Dealer Investigative Notes (II) Ever since I started working for the press, I've grown particularly sensitive to gray market operations, and I couldn't help myself from getting to the truth. This guy was dressed completely differently from last time, but his movements were a dead giveaway. Seeing me draw closer, he also recognized me from before and started to banter again. At first, I was worried he was going to take revenge on me... Then I realized I was worrying too much \u2014 this guy had never taken a stint in prison seriously. He said the Xianzhou had been a mess recently, and he'd sniffed out a chance to sell medicinal materials \u2014 none other than the vines grown from mara-struck victims... He was going to peddle it to Outworlders seeking everlasting life! I was shocked... Could that really be used as medicine? Would it work? This wicked black market dealer and his demented blasphemy... If I wrote an expos\u00e9, would he be condemned? No, I'd better ask instead whether or not he'd make it off the Xianzhou alive... Thinking about all this filled my heart with the power of justice. I had to track him down to the very end! Black Market Dealer Investigative Notes (III) This schmuck just went and got some tree branches from the Ever-Hunt Plains! It's not mara-struck at all!"}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6481","text":"Blizzard Immunity Lab Records Blizzard Immunity Lab Records is a readable found in Jarilo-VI. Text. Part I. Animal Experiment #02 I carried out a broad-spectrum animal injection experiment. The animals all appeared to grow more active, but the dose needs to be adjusted because the two snow finches have been screeching nonstop for three days. I couldn't sleep at all. It is absolutely the right decision for me to come to the Snow Plains to conduct the experiment. I do not have to deal with those cretins on the ethics committee, nor do I have to produce those so-called daily reports. Why would I waste time writing so many words when two phrases can adequately explain the experiment? Animal Experiment #14 Several controlled experiments with mice have been conducted, and it appears that the route of administration impacts the rate of medicine absorption, with preliminary findings indicating that intraperitoneal injection is more effective than subcutaneous injection and oral gavage. Shock symptoms were observed in the intraperitoneal injection group, indicating that the injection dose should be further reduced. Human testing should also be expedited. I was hesitant to experiment with these mice because they reminded me of the ones Natasha had as a child. Despite the fact that I've been much more productive here, the limited supply and test subjects remain a major issue. There's a guard outpost to the south. Perhaps I can trade with them. I'm running low on firewood and oil. Subcutaneous Injection Experiment #01 A subcutaneous injection was given into a vein on my own right arm, and I had a severe allergic response that included vomiting and dizziness within 12 hours, but the medication's effectiveness on the human body was confirmed. For the following 50 hours, I didn't feel cold. I've made little progress on the report since I've been experiencing numbness in my fingers for the past several days, and I'm wondering if it is a side effect of the subcutaneous injection. The swelling and rashes on my back and arms have subsided significantly. Next time, I'll try a more stable formula. Part II. Injection Experiment #12 After the final injection experiment, I had a significant rejection response in my stomach as well as an intermittent, sudden dip in body temperature after a slow climb. I need to improve the experiment's stability and possibly try a safer route of administration, such as oral administration. Lately, I've been practicing writing with my left hand because it appears that I can no longer control the muscles in my right hand. I shouldn't have been so impatient. Coughing and dizziness continue to bother me occasionally. It's been 17 days since the last time I suffered shock symptoms, and the medicine should be much more stable now. I haven't eaten rabbit stew in a long time and have been craving it, so I'm going to ask the Guard Captain how to make traps the day after tomorrow. Oral Administration Experiment #03 My body temperature stayed consistent during the 30-hour observation period, with intermittent symptoms of coughing up blood and asthma. The specific cause is still unknown, but it is likely related to drug residues and a high concentration of non-metabolizable substances. Maybe I should try a different targeting agent? I'm not sure if I put the dates correctly because I've been waking up in the middle of the night for days. I just noticed a lack of control in my shoulders and neck, requiring me to sleep with a high pillow, but will it eventually spread to my brain? Oral Administration Experiment #07 Several guards have provided competent feedback, and the medication's effect can now last for nearly five days. My vocal cords appear to have suffered irreversible damage. Therefore, I've been unable to talk recently. Next week, I'll be sending the most secure batch of reagents to the guard outpost. I really appreciate their assistance. If my legs feel better tomorrow, I'll go trim the grass at the back of the house. I shouldn't bother the guards anymore."}

After Duran and the beast, Taowu, slaughtered the Foxians, Duran asked Yaoshi to bless the borisin with immortality. However this narrative is a fictional myth created by the borisin to justify their enslavement of the Foxians and to solidify their racial identity through worship of Yaoshi. Yaoshi does not bless only the strong and it is evident that the borisin interpret \"Abundance\" based on their own cultural norms and values. Physiology. The borisin have a distinct canine anatomical structure: Broad, lean skeletons; powerful jaws and neck muscles; well-developed canine fangs; pointed beast-like ears atop the skull; and sharp claws on hand and foot. The borisin worship the concept of a strong body, seeing strong physique as a blessing from the gods. The wingweaver Xili implied that Foxians on the Xianzhou Zhuming look similar to borisin. Within the broad classification of long-life species, the borisin can be said to have the greatest healing ability. Alongside this hyper-healing is their ability to shapeshift, known as \"Moon Madness.\" This ability has also been observed very rarely in some Foxians, apart from the Foxians of the Yaoqing. The Yaoqing Foxians are said to be genetically similar to the borisin. Shapeshifting is accompanied by intense hyperplasia of the bone and muscle structure, such as a protruded snout and jawline, and the twisting in of the foot structure. This damaging deformation process is eventually completely restored by the borisin's rapid healing ability. During battle, the borisin emit a pheromone known as Lupitoxin, which stimulates fear in the amygdala. To counteract these effects, the Cloud Knights take medicinal pellets to suppress their innate fear when in combat. When the livers of borisin are removed, it was found that they turned into a huge, aggressive \"cancerous mass\" within a few hours. The coloration of their blood is pitch-black. Technology. The borisin are masters of biotechnology, and use it to manufacture weapons, armor, and spaceships, as well as modify their own bodies. Their weapons and armor have some characteristics of living beings, while their spaceships, called mechabeasts or beast ships, are living beings with the ability to feed, attack, and reproduce. They have been known to enslave and modify members of other intelligent races to attack and plunder planets. Society. The borisin have a tribal council system, and have a culture that reveres strength and preying on the weak. A single tribe is called a \"Pack,\" while a coalition of tribes is called a \"Great Pack.\" The leader of a Pack is called a Brood Lord, typically the strongest and most cunning among them. In a Great Pack, the Brood Lords of each pack fight each other and are ranked based on strength, with the strongest of them being called the \"Father Wolf\" or \"Warmuhtar\". The Warmuhtar is both the spiritual leader and the strongest warrior of the tribe, commanding its tide-like army, and dominating life and death on the battlefield. The borisin despise settled civilizations and roam the galaxy bringing all-consuming war with them. Their harsh beliefs in survival compel them to fight incessantly and devote themselves to a life of bloodshed and conquest. The former Warmuhtar, Hoolay, took pride and joy in ravaging other civilizations. In order to surpass former leaders, the new Warmuhtar had to lead his soldiers on an expedition in order to make a name for himself and affirm his position in the tribe. When put on trial by the Ten-Lord Commission, Hoolay was confused by the sentence, as he saw his crimes as nothing more than him following the laws of survival. History. Under the borisin, the Denizens of Abundance have had three large-scale wars with the Xianzhou Alliance. After the capture and imprisonment of the Abundance Axis's last Warmuhtar, Hoolay, the coalition has greatly declined in strength."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=20491","text":"Borisin Folk Song Collection Borisin Folk Song Collection is a readable found aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. To the Venerable Ten Lords, I'm Dr. Zongguang, a doctor in cultural anthropology from the Luofu's Grand Virtue Academy. Together with a team of twenty-six dedicated researchers and students, we have collected and recorded the cultural regarding the borisins' tribes and hunting rituals. Our journey led us to scour battlefields in search of war relics, seek out freed slaves, and even conducting field research by infiltrating borisin settlements under the guise of an IPC trade team. Throughout our research, we lost three researchers, including my own mentor. Now the research and data compilation effort spanning six decades has drawn to a close, we humbly present this tome titled \"Borisin Folk Song Collection\". Within its pages, you will find a comprehensive compilation of two hundred and fifty-one oral epics and ballads of the borisin, serving as a valuable reference. Dr. Zongguang, Anthropologist from the Luofu Grand Virtue Academy 27. The Birth of Duran [1] We Borisins were short-lived, skinner than burden beasts.We dared not move about in broad daylight, fighting for survival in the shadows of night.[2]In clouds came, down rain poured, lightning flashed and thunder roared.A din, a crack, a peal, a crash and from the sky fell flesh and blood smashed.Muttering prayers with scrape and bows, the great Shaman fell on his knees, kowtowed,claiming that this was a fortuitous mark, a sign of the Master of Immortality's heart.[3]Seventy-two days later, the tribe's chieftain child was born.[4]Strong and powerful as a wild beast right from the womb born,That was Duran, our first Warmuhtar. Footnote:[1] This folk song holds significant importance in the ritualistic practices of the borisin. It should be noted that the borisin possess a distorted understanding and interpretation of the concepts embodied by the Plagues Author. Instead of establishing worship for the Plagues Author, the first Warmuhtar, Duran, cunningly utilized worship to solidify the foundation of the borisin's racial identity. [2] Current archaeological excavations have verified the authenticity of this aspect. During the era preceding their acquisition of long life, the borisin indeed endured slow progress due to the harsh natural environment of their homeworld. [3] No concrete evidence supports the occurrence of this plague catastrophe in history. Certain historical sources suggest that the author of these songs fabricated this legend to validate the divine legitimacy of Duran's reign. [4] The motif of \"a baby born after mere days of conception\" is a recurring heroic theme in borisin songs and has become an established literary device. According to their songs, nearly all of their Warmuhtars spent only a few days in their mothers' wombs. 28. Duran's Pilgrimage to the Master of Immortality [1] Duran treads the thorny road, seeking the Master of Immortality,that borisins might rule over all creation, from death and suffering given salvation.[2]But the Master of did not bless all, saying only the strong would never fall.[3]The Master of commanded the Foxian, myriads strong to guard the enlightened tree where the weak didn't belong.[4]Master of then left Duran with a beast, the Taowu seeking the sweet dew from the treetop, a feast.Duran and the Taowu tore through the ranks, killing thousands as their foes numbers shrank.[5]They killed till flesh shards and broken bones filled the air. They killed till no living Foxian would show hide nor hair.Duran walked the river of blood to the divine tree, and piously taking the dew from the freshest branch tip, took a knee.Duran, immortality claimed, asked the Master again: \"Would you not share your blessing with my fellow kin?\"From the clouds the great Master let dew fall to the land, and all creatures now lived till the cosmos' end.[6]Having enlightened existence, the Master of Immortality commanded, the million Foxians vanquished would be by defeat branded:\"Conquered by Duran, who conquered the tree, you shall be borisin's slaves for perpetuity.\"[7]Granting the borisin bodies of steel, he mandated us to conquer the heavens for to repay his goodwill.[8] Footnote:[1] While this folk song is a significant foundation of the borisin's collective racial memory, its historical accuracy is questionable. It indeed portrays several important events in the borisin's history, but does so with a considerable amount of dramatization. [2] Existing historical and archaeological evidence suggests that the unexpected rise of the borisin can be attributed to the indiscriminate dissemination of the plague catastrophe by the Plagues Author. After all, considering the level of civilization of the borisin during that time, it is implausible that they actively initiated contact with the Aeon. [3] Even for the Plagues Author, this statement would be a blatantly defamatory remark. It is evident that the borisin interprets the concept of \"Abundance\" based on their own cultural norms and values. [4] This folk song fabricates a narrative in which the \"the Master of Immortality ordered the Foxians to test the borisin,\" using this fictional myth to provide a supposed justification for the borisin's enslavement of the Foxians. [5] Based on current archaeological evidence, it is believed that after the borisin gained longevity, at least two Amber Eras had passed before they created the beast they currently use. The reference to \"Taowu\" in this context should be considered fictional. After all, without the means for interstellar travel, it is impossible for Warmuhtar Duran to embark on a pilgrimage to the Aeon. [6] This portion is intriguing. According to the story, the Plagues Author did not originally intend to bestow immortality upon all individuals. It was the Warmuhtar who requested this blessing for everyone. This supports the editor's assertion in the commentary in Song #27 that \"Instead of establishing worship for the Plagues Author, the first Warmuhtar, Duran, cunningly utilized worship to solidify the foundation of the borisin's racial identity.'\" [7] The purpose of this part is solely to legitimize the borisin's enslavement of the Foxians. [8] Similarly, the purpose of this part is to legitimize the borisin's policy of plundering and invading other civilizations."}

This story belongs to the coolest guy in the \"Clockie\" cartoon. He's full of sharp wit, sticks to his morals, tenacious and brave, undaunted by danger, often helping his friends out of bad situations, and has thwarted Boss Stone's plots countless times... He's Clockie's most trustworthy comrade, the baddies' most-feared opponent, the beloved great hero of Dreamville... Brother Hanu! Always garbed in a stylish coat, with a suave dress hat over his head and shades to conceal his piercing gaze, he patrols Dreamville wordlessly. He's more composed than the erudite Professor Owl, more decisive than the revered Old Man Wood, and more popular than the flamboyant Miss Note. \"Twenty-two 'crocodiles' came this time, all bringing their heavy 'tails' with them.\" In the previous story, Brother Hanu defeated the Buzzflies plaguing Dreamville, but the despicable Boss Stone capitalized on this chaos and stole the shrinking machine that Professor Owl invented. In this newly-arisen threat that Dreamville faces, Brother Hanu has been turned into Mini-Hanu by the shrinking machine, and can't defeat Boss Stone with his once-mighty strength. \"\"\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, are you riding out personally?\"\" But don't underestimate Brother Hanu's wit! This suave, silent lad isn't just some savage musclehead. This time, he is going to be just like his old friend, Clockie \u2014 even if burdened by his miniature physique, he'll use his brains and guile to defeat Boss Stone, wrest back Dreamville from the villain, and return it to everyone. \"A very cool *Hmph*.\"\"Oh you, always so dashing.\" Part 1, Chapter 1. Once the Buzzflies left Dreamville, this haven once again regained its joy and laughter. One fine day, Clockie was once again at the plaza pulling off his usual pranks. \"Augh!!! Clockie, you mischievous brat, chirp! I'm going to get you this time!\" The angry red birdie pursued Clockie relentlessly, pecking away at him at every chance. It was the origami bird with the worst temper \u2014 Clockie REALLY got under its feathers this time. \"Tick-tock! Boss Red, please stop it! All I did was give Professor Owl's statue a makeover! I'm sure he won't mind!\" \"\"Nonsense! Of course he will! They must never be allowed to enter \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0! This is the home that we've toiled away for, spending untold blood, sweat, and tears to build.\"\" It's just as Clockie said \u2014 Professor Owl's statue was an atrocious mess of colors, especially the dial on his face. Both hands looked like he had grown extra needle-thin whiskers \u2014 a truly comical sight. \"Ahem, Clockie, Professor Owl is the origami birds' teacher and a patron to the foundation of our Dreamville. You must not offend him.\" Old Man Wood, the person who liked to lecture the most in town, hobbled over with branch cane in hand. Following behind him was the \"super-cool\" Brother Hanu. \"*cough* Brother Hanu, you say something to him as well.\" Old Man Wood said. \"Hmph.\" Brother Hanu emitted an aloof sound, with that perennially cool demeanor of his. \"Abandon our plan to lure the enemy deep into our lines? But the difference between our forces is...\" But this hmph made both Clockie and Boss Red instantly cease their bickering. \"Tick-tock, sorry... I'll clean up the statue right now...\" The minute hand on Clockie's dial drooped, and he lowered his clock face. In the eyes of Clockie, Brother Hanu wasn't just his bestie, but also his arch nemesis \u2014 he would never want to cross this stone-cold, dead-pan wolf. \"\"I understand, but you have to come back safe... \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 won't be the same without you.\"\" Brother Hanu nodded in approval as he watched Clockie remove the clock hands from the statue as instructed. He turned away to leave the plaza, disappearing into the shadows of an alley alone. To him, quelling the town's disputes is but a trifle. The real trouble lies with evildoers who would threaten the town's peace \u2014 they would not be so easily deterred with a simple grunt. And so, Brother Hanu must be on high alert every single day, scouring every nook and cranny in Dreamville to eliminate the evils that lurk in dark corners. But it is this very meticulousness that allowed Boss Stone to swoop in... \"A confident grunt.\" Part 1, Chapter 2. Hanu stumbled across a peculiar television in the corner of a street in Dreamville. Hanu sized up the television suspiciously. His intuition told him that it must belong to the Origami Birds and Professor Owl, the only candidates who would tinker with such a complicated machine. Compared to watching TV, the other townspeople prefer enjoying Miss Note's performance at the theater. Hanu decided to return the television to Professor Owl after some consideration. However, a strange wave of electricity surged through his body the moment he touched the television. He realized that something was terribly wrong, but it was all too late. Following a sinister and boorish laughter, the scenery before Hanu started to distort... \"Hahahaha, Hanu, you took the bait! I knew you couldn't stop yourself from touching that thing!\" \"\"\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0! All the 'crocodiles' will be swimming your way!\" \"\"Stop going any further! This is a trap!\" When Hanu's vision cleared up, he noticed that the sky has suddenly turned overcast. The sun that was shining brightly moments before was nowhere to be seen... Wait a minute. Something is covering the sun! He looked up and finds himself coming face-to-face with a gaping mouth. It belongs to the greatest nemesis of Dreamville: Boss Stone! Boss Stone is very tall indeed, but he's never been so huge that he can easily crush Hanu with his foot. Boss Stone, with his mouth wide open, lunged at Hanu, but Hanu was agile enough to dodge the sneak attack with a roll. With a groan, Boss Stone fell to the ground. \"(Thunderous sounds of explosions and collisions)\" \"Despicable Hanu! Just you wait!\" Hanu ran off without turning back. Even though he was as agile as a wolf, he still found himself bewildered by the situation. How come Boss Stone had become so enormous? Why did the surroundings look so foreign to him? Could he be still inside the trap set by Boss Stone? What on earth is going on? \"An agonizing grunt.\" Part 1, Chapter 3. Hanu soon discovered the truth \u2014 Boss Stone didn't become bigger. It was he who had dwindled in size! This did not bode well, given that Hanu had always relied on his strength to overcome Boss Stone. Now that he had turned so small and couldn't even carry the launcher of the Hanu Missile, how was he supposed to handle Boss Stone? While Hanu was still struggling to comprehend the situation, Boss Stone kicked off his evil scheme. All houses were made of precious gems in Dreamville, and are therefore treasures desired by Boss Stone. With his underling little crocodiles, he barged into Dreamville brazenly and started demolishing the houses of the residents. Without Hanu's protection, the vulnerable residents could only cower in corners. The Origami Birds that built those houses gathered on the paper tree and started chirping at Boss Stone in protest. \"These scoundrels are planning to land via the residential area... There's no way to open fire at all!\" \"Hahaha, make as much noise as you want! Hanu won't come to your rescue anymore! All the gems in Dreamville will be mine!\" Boss Stone laughed like a maniac, watching Dreamville turn into a wreck. This had been his most successful raid against Dreamville since he set his eyes on the town. The stocky crocodile strutted around with his belly sticking out like a victorious general. When he walked past the plaza, he immediately caught sight of Professor Owl's statue. \"Listen up, this silly bird's statue is made of premium material! Bring the whole thing back! I'm going to turn it into a statue of myself!\" Just as the small crocodiles were ready to make a move on the statue, an unexpected figure emerged to block their way... \"Tick-tock! Stop it, jerks! Brace yourselves for my Clockwork!\" It was Clockie! Clockie would never allow anyone else to wreak havoc in Dreamville! He alone was the only troublemaker in town! Clockie tried moving his minute hand with his finger to launch his Clockwork. Everything in Dreamville could come under the control of his dial, and he could even alter everyone's thoughts and turn back time! Thanks to this magical power, Clockie became the people's savior just like Hanu. Nevertheless, Hanu is still the protagonist of this story. Before Clockie could move his minute hand, the small crocodiles working for Boss Stone beat him to it by pouring a bucket of odd liquid all over his head. \"Tick... tock... What's wrong... Why can't I move it...\" Clockie's body became sticky and his minute hand was stuck to the dial. \"\"Indeed, I'm still no match for you when it comes to commanding a battle. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0... Please stay safe.\"\" \"Haha, Clockie! This super adhesive glue is specially prepared for you! You can stay here and be the new statue!\" \"Tick-tock...\" As the glue dried up, poor Clockie was stuck to the ground of the plaza. The residents in hiding were panic-stricken and could only pin their hopes on the still-absent Hanu. Where exactly was Hanu now? \"Hold on. I think I heard him just now...\"\"A low grunt.\" Part 1, Chapter 4. Boss Stone had occupied Dreamville and taken over Old Man Wood's mansion. His room was filled to the brim with looted gems. \"Dreamville shall be called Stoneville in the future... Wait, the name isn't grand enough. It should be Stone Empire instead, hahaha!\" Boss Stone was drooling from his ravenous mouth, so carried away by the rosy picture he painted of the future that he had forgotten about a problem he had yet to solve... Meanwhile, on the border of Dreamville, the hardworking Professor Owl was still engrossed in designing new buildings for the town. Unaware that his past works were being destroyed by Boss Stone, he was leisurely searching for stones suitable to construct houses. \"\"\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, how are you doing?\"\"I knew you wouldn't go down with that hunk of repurposed Spheroid trash.\"\" Suddenly, Professor Owl came across a moving stone. It piqued his curiosity as he had never seen a stone that could move on its own in his long years of living. He quickly flew over, picked up the stone with his beak, and was surprised by its soft and fluffy texture. As it turned out, it was Hanu! Professor Owl immediately put Hanu down and asked in a puzzled voice, \"Cuckoo, how did you turn so small, Hanu? You're even smaller than my students!\" Hanu let out a resigned grunt. Professor Owl quickly put two and two together and figured out everything. He lost the shrinking machine he invented during the invasion of the Old Buzzflies, (Note: This story is part of the \"Clockie &amp; Old Buzzflies\" animated series. The relevant dream bubble episodes are available for purchase in all major Dreamscapes.) and it might have fallen into the wrong hands, leading to Hanu's transformation. \"You're pretty lucky to have crashed into the enemy's main ship.\"\"But I don't think you're fit to fight anymore, judging from your injuries...\" \"Cuckoo, only a shrinking machine can change you back. If Boss Stone has it, you'll be in hot water...\" Even someone as smart as Professor Owl was at his wit's end. However, Hanu didn't see it as an insurmountable problem. If getting back to his original size was the only way to rescue Dreamville, then he would do everything he could to achieve that. If he must defeat Boss Stone in the process, then he would give it his all to achieve it with his petite body! Seeing Hanu's determined eyes behind his sunglasses, Professor Owl knew that Hanu had made up his mind. \"\"Wait. Is he going to execute the plan inside a \"crocodile's\" abdomen while he's injured? This is outrageous!\"\"But then again, he's right. We have no other options left.\"\" \"I've got it, cuckoo. Your courage is impressive! You're truly the hero of Dreamville, cuckoo!\" Professor Owl had decided to help Hanu defeat Boss Stone. Firstly, he sent the Origami Birds to investigate Boss Stone's location. Then, he had the birds set up various mechanisms that could give Hanu a boost. When everything was all set, Professor Owl picked up Hanu again. Professor Owl, as well as all the Origami Birds, believed that this light and diminutive figure would rescue Dreamville. \"Let's go! I'll help you defeat Boss Stone, cuckoo!\" Hanu nodded and flew in the direction of Dreamville with the flock of birds. \"I've got it... I'll count on you to carry everyone's dream once again.\"\"A firm grunt.\" Part 2 Chapter 1. Professor Owl struggled to flap his wings, finally returning Brother Hanu to Dreamville. The once-prosperous Dreamville lay in a state of disrepair, with ugly sculptures of Boss Stone scattered everywhere. Crocodiles roamed the streets, brazenly causing trouble for the residents... They wreaked havoc, destroying the houses that the Origami Birds meticulously built, kicked over Miss Note's splendid stage, gulping down all of Mr. Soda's sodas, and messing around with Old Man Wood's carefully trimmed canopy. \"\"Professor \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, the crocodiles have invaded the Dreamscape.\"\"\"Really...? Well, maybe they've made an unwise choice.\" Witnessing the chaotic scene, Brother Hanu recalled the time when this place was once the Nightmareville, letting out a *hmph* in fury. He vowed to defeat the villainous Boss Stone despite his diminished size. Professor Owl, witnessing his student being bullied, also grew furious. \"Hoot-Hoot... We'll teach that cursed Boss Stone a lesson, Brother Hanu! Let me assist you!\" Professor Owl soared to the rooftop of the Town Hotel, a location hidden from Boss Stone's view. He hooted, summoning all the Origami Birds in town. These little helpers painted the sky with vibrant colors. \"\"Professor \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, how did you manage to let the Nightingale...\"\"\"Hehe, have faith in these youngsters. No one knows about weapons in the Dreamscape better than they do.\" Boss Stone and his minions were taken aback by the overwhelming number of Origami Birds. They've never seen so many birds.Professor Owl handed them some secret blueprints, and after reading them, the birds wiped away their tears, regained their spirits, and began working on top of the houses occupied by Boss Stone. Before Boss Stone could react, the entire town underwent a transformation thanks to the Origami birds. Mr. Soda's bottle shack turned into a formidable cannon, Miss Note's gala cruise became a battleship, and even Old Man Wood's oak mansion transformed into a wooden dinosaur ready to devour crocodiles. \"This is so cool, Professor! We should make more of these in the Dreamscape!\"\"...No.\" Boss Stone and his minions trembled in terror, overwhelmed by the creations of the Origami Birds. They sought refuge inside Town Hotel. This caused Professor Owl to worry. The hotel was the most magnificent building in Dreamville and the most profitable business in town. It must not be damaged! Seeing the formidable weapons halting at the gate, hesitant to attack, Boss Stone understood the birds' worries and let out a sinister laughter. \"Hahaha, you dare not attack me, you stupid birds! Minions, come to me! Toss some lit matches and torch these monsters down to ashes!\" The crocodiles hurled the ignited matches at the Origami Birds' weapons, reducing them to ashes. \"Repelling them in the Dreamscape is just a temporary solution... Even if we defeat the crocodiles here, our firepower disadvantage in reality remains desperate. If we lose the central sector, all the kids in the Dreamscape will be in danger...\"\"\"Don't worry, Professor \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. We still have Hanunue!\"\" Oh, right. Brother Hanu has returned, and he is the protagonist of this tale!However, with his tiny size, how is Brother Hanu expected to defeat those colossal crocodiles with their fearsome jaws? Professor Owl furrowed his brow, the Origami Birds sighed with concern, and even Clockie, transformed into a statue, reflected worry in his eyes. However, Brother Hanu remained resolute, his expression unwavering as he silently advanced toward the hotel. \"He let out a confident *hmph*!\" Part 2 Chapter 2. \"Most of their forces are probably deployed on the front lines, but they definitely have some troops guarding their main vessel. So, be careful, Hanunue.\" Hanu infiltrated the hotel unarmed while Boss Stone's minions patrolled the corridors, fearful that someone might steal the treasures amassed by their boss here. Thanks to his small stature, Brother Hanu skillfully evaded the villains within the hotel, his eyes scanning for any signs of Boss Stone. Upon entering the lobby, Brother Hanu spotted Lieutenant Chitters, Boss Stone's trusted sidekick. Lieutenant Chitters was an even larger crocodile than Boss Stone, creating an impenetrable barrier that not even a mosquito could pass through. Before, a single shot from the Hanu Launcher would have dealt with this big oaf. Now, however, Hanu needs to come up with another plan. \"\"I trust in your abilities, but with your current stature, it's best to not go head-to-head with someone in high-grade IPC battlesuit...\"\" What now?As Hanu hid atop a storage shelf to brainstorm, Lieutenant Chitters suddenly came walking over. \"Chit-chit. Hm. I think I smell the scent of a wolf!\" Confronted with the approaching Lieutenant Chitters, Brother Hanu had no means of evasion. A clash became inevitable!Bracing himself for the battle, Brother Hanu lunged at Lieutenant Chitters... However, Lieutenant Chitters didn't even notice the tiny Brother Hanu and accidentally swallowed him whole in an instant! Had Brother Hanu been devoured? \"Clamorous sounds of mechanical collisions, roaring, and gunshots.\" \"Chit! Is something wrong with my nose?\" The dumb crocodile glanced left and right, scratching his head in confusion.Lieutenant Chitters felt something between his teeth but paid it no mind. After all, this sloppy crocodile never bothered to floss his teeth, and that's how Brother Hanu escaped his jaws. Brother Hanu deftly maneuvered between Lieutenant Chitters's razor-sharp teeth and made his way through the dangerous mouth, hiding inside a tooth cavity! \"I told you not to engage in a head-on clash, Hanunue! You really should have listened!\"\"\"Alright, Professor, we both know his style... Well, now that you're inside the mecha, you won't rouse any suspicion from the guards, and the life support devices contained within will help you address your injuries.\"\" With that, Hanu found the best hiding spot. Part 2 Chapter 3. Brother Hanu managed to stay safe, but simply hiding in wouldn't cut it. He had to find Boss Stone and defeat him, or else Dreamville would be taken over by the crocodiles.However, how could Brother Hanu locate Boss Stone while trapped inside Lieutenant Chitters's tooth cavity? Not to worry though: our cool hero Hanu will always find a way. \"\"Yeah, he always finds a way. After all, he's the head of the Bloodhounds and the legendary rebel who has sparked countless revolutions.\"\" Inside Lieutenant Chitters's mouth, Brother Hanu meditated, but the crocodile's terrible breath assaulted his delicate nose. Unable to bear it any longer, he let out a disgusted *hmph*. \"Chit! Brother Hanu! I heard Brother Hanu's voice!\" The *hmph* startled Lieutenant Chitters, who anxiously searched every corner for Brother Hanu but to no avail. Watching Lieutenant Chitters's funny reaction, Brother Hanu came up with a brilliant idea!He kept making noises inside Lieutenant Chitters's mouth, confusing the crocodile more and more. \"They know someone has infiltrated their capital ship. A portion of their forces are returning to defend.\"\"Be careful, Hanunue... But I think they won't expect to find you hiding in the armored mechs that are looking for the prisoner.\" \"Chit-Chit! Where are you, Brother Hanu!?\" Lieutenant Chitters frantically searched, almost tearing the hotel upside down. He sensed Brother Hanu's presence right next to him, but couldn't find that cool dark figure no matter what. \"Lieutenant! Brother Hanu's voice is coming from you!\" Lieutenant Chitters's sidekick noticed the situation and informed the not-so-brainy boss.\"Chit! Could Brother Hanu... be hiding on me!?\" Lieutenant Chitters stripped himself naked, hoping to find Brother Hanu, but he was still nowhere to be found.Meanwhile, Brother Hanu continued to make noises in his mouth, pushing Lieutenant Chitters closer to a mental breakdown. \"Chit! Could it be that Brother Hanu has learned to become invisible? If that's the case, I must report to Boss Stone immediately!\"In a panicked state, Lieutenant Chitters raced up the stairs while naked. This was all part of Brother Hanu's plan, and soon he would confront Boss Stone with no effort of his own. \"The command center is on this floor... You really are a genius, Hanunue.\" Part 2 Chapter 4. \"Chit! Boss Stone! Terrible news, chit!\"Lieutenant Chitters burst into the opulent suite, shouting in panic. Boss Stone, still dreaming in his grand bubble bed, was abruptly awakened by the sight of a naked, chubby crocodile standing before him. \"What are you doing, you idiot!?\" Seethed with fury, Boss Stone unleashed a powerful smack of his tail upon Lieutenant Chitters's face, knocking out his teeth.Brother Hanu, who had been hiding in a tooth cavity, was propelled out as well. Seizing the opportunity, Brother Hanu swiftly found refuge in the corner of Boss Stone's room, ready to strike like a wolf. \"The enemy's main forces are returning to reinforce, Hanunue. Are you holding up well?\"\"A confident *hmph*.\" \"Chit-Chit... Brother Hanu has returned, Boss Stone! And he's become invisible! I only heard his cool *hmph* but couldn't find him anywhere!\"Lieutenant Chitters' mention of the name \"Brother Hanu\" sent a shiver down Boss Stone's spine. \"That cursed Brother Hanu... I see. Now, get out of here, and next time, wear your pants before coming to me!\" After dismissing Lieutenant Chitters, Boss Stone grew increasingly anxious. Although he had shrunk Brother Hanu to a tiny size, he knew that Brother Hanu was still the valiant hero of Dreamville! Boss Stone unlocked his safe and looked at the Hanu Launcher he had stashed away. He sighed in relief when he thought how Brother Hanu was even smaller than his own teeth right now. \"You hear this, Brother Hanu? Even if you've come back, there's no way you can defeat me in your tiny form!\" Boss Stone bellowed, believing that Brother Hanu would hear his words... And indeed, Brother Hanu did. \"You've found the ammunition warehouse? But even with enough ammunition, you just can't eliminate all these 'crocodiles,' can you?\"\"A disdainful *hmph*.\" Boss Stone returned to his dreams on his large bed, but uneasiness plagued him. He slept restlessly, as his beautiful dream turned into a nightmare due to that scare.Emerging from the shadows, Brother Hanu stepped forward and opened the cabinet, which now appeared hundreds of times larger than him. He stepped inside... \"What did you say... Wait, Hanunue! No!\"\"A chuckling *hmph*.\" The Hanu Launcher was right in front of him. Tiny Brother Hanu struggled to carry the ammunition and load it into the weapon. \"Stop it, Hanunue! You can't do that!\"\"A disapproving *hmph*.\" The noise from the cabinet awakened Boss Stone once again.\"Could it be... that Brother Hanu is really here?\" Fear gripped Boss Stone as he gulped and rose from his bed.\"No fear, my brothers! He's now so tiny that we can crush him in a single bite!\" Boss Stone called out to all of his fellow crocodiles, all of whom huddled together in the room, near the cabinet... \"Don't go, Hanunue... What should I do without you in Penacony...?\"\"A resigned *hmph*.\" The crocodiles opened the cabinet, only to be confronted with the dark muzzle of the launcher and tiny Brother Hanu standing beside the firing button. \"\"I'm sure you can do it, because you are 'the Watchmaker'.\"\" Brother Hanu let out a cool *hmph* and stepped on the firing button. \"A cool *hmph*.\"\"A deafening explosion, followed by absolute silence.\" Part 3, Chapter 1. BOOM! Brother Hanu's powerful launcher blows Boss Stone away, but it also ignites the fireworks stored within the mansion.The violent explosion shatters every window in town, toppling several houses. The force of the impact sends the immobile Clockie hurtling into a nearby pond, finally granting him the freedom to move once more! \"Tick-tock! Brother Hanu! Where are you, Brother Hanu!?\" Back then, while Clockie was firmly attached to the town square, he still witnessed everything that happened within the town. He saw how Mini-Hanu infiltrated Boss Stone's fortress and witnessed that violent explosion. Not even stopping to pour out the water in his dial, Clockie sprints towards the origin of the explosion... Amidst the scattered debris, Clockie discovers nothing more than a small hat. \"Hanunue... but why? If you don't wake up now, Penacony will...\"\"Pull yourself together, 'Watchmaker.' Someone must maintain control of the situation... If a wolf pack suddenly loses its leader, chaos is bound to ensue.\" The townsfolk cautiously emerge from their hiding places, their curiosity piqued by the abrupt silence that has befallen the streets. All the crocodiles that once roamed the town have vanished, leaving only Clockie amidst the ruins, shedding inconsolable tears. \"Clockie, Clockie, did you kick Boss Stone's tush?\"\"Clockie, Clockie, where has Brother Hanu gone?\" Clockie understands that the townsfolk seek reassurance now that they have just become free of Boss Stone's terror. And so, this time, Clockie tells them a lie yet again... \"Is that true, Mr. 'Watchmaker'?\"\"Yes. The family head Hanunue sustained grave injuries during the previous defensive battle and will be temporarily unable to fulfill his duties. But rest assured, Hanunue will continue making significant decisions for Penacony.\" \"Tick-tock, don't worry! Brother Hanu has just kicked Boss Stone's derriere and is now resting! It won't be long before you see his cool figure in the town once more!\" Reassured by Clockie's words, everyone casts aside their fears and revels in the grand victory, knowing that they finally kicked out Boss Stone. They believe the terrible big crocodile won't trouble Dreamville again anytime soon after this defeat.They throw a grand celebration in honor of Brother Hanu, even though he himself is absent. Everyone enjoys a cheerful time... except for Clockie. That night, Clockie's mind is burdened with thoughts that keep him awake until the early hours.In his dreams, Clockie finds himself standing in a vast desert, with Brother Hanu positioned at the far end, gazing up at the sky. \"Tick-tock! Where have you been, Brother Hanu?\"\"Come back to us, Brother Hanu! Dreamville simply can't exist without you!\" In silence, Brother Hanu only watches as Clockie runs towards him, then gently removes his hat. \"Hmph, it's beautiful here, don't you think?\"\"Yeah, is that why you don't want to wake up?\"\"No, the reason I don't want to wake up... is because all of you are sleeping so deeply.\"\"I...\"\"Then come here and rest, 'Watchmaker.' If you lack the courage to face the nightmares, then seek refuge in sweet dreams for now...\" \"But remember, as long as this is a dream, you'll have to wake up from it sooner or later.\" He emits a cool hmph. Then Clockie awakens, his clock face adorned with a tear stain. Part 3, Chapter 2. Since Brother Hanu disappeared, Boss Stone has never returned to plague the town. However, he has dishonorably blocked Dreamville's shipping routes. The stones can't be sold to outsiders, and vital resources cannot be shipped in. \"Clockie, Clockie! We're starving!\"\"Clockie, Clockie! Get Brother Hanu to do something!\" But what can Clockie do if Brother Hanu doesn't come back?The situation in Dreamville grows more serious each day, and the townsfolk are all urging Clockie to take action. However, no matter how his clock hands spin round and round, he cannot find a better solution.Soon, Shopkeeper Leaf in town comes up with a terrible idea. He writes a letter to Boss Stone, wanting to tell Stone about Brother Hanu's disappearance \u2014 working to dig stones is better than starving to death! However, Shopkeeper Leaf's secret is discovered by Leafy, whom he had raised with his own hands. Leafy wastes no time in alerting Clockie and the others.Shopkeeper Leaf is apprehended, and the furious townsfolk interrogate this traitor, eagerly discussing his punishment. \"\"Esteemed heads of the families, this time we need to discuss how to deal with Lakkika from the Alfalfa Family.\"\"We have uncovered the truth about the White Desert Incident from before. He must take responsibility for the fall of the Blackplum Family and countless Fruits.\"\"\"Heh, perhaps he's also the one who summoned the IPC's fleet here last time.\"\"Nevertheless, Lakkika's contributions to Penacony cannot be ignored. Therefore, I propose we imprison him...\"\"Kill him.\"\"But...\"\"If Hanunue were here, that's what he would do.\" Everyone said that, if Brother Hanu were here, he would undoubtedly deliver severe punishments to Shopkeeper Leaf!Clockie originally wishes to spare his former friend, but he cannot go against all the enraged townsfolk. With a heavy heart, he plucks off all the leaves from Shopkeeper Leaf. Leafy takes charge of his father's shop, distributing the delicious leaves to alleviate the hunger of the townsfolk.However, the leaves are quickly consumed, and the crisis in Dreamville persists. Clockie summons a few companions from the Compass, hoping their collective wisdom will devise a solution. \"\"Fear not. With the guidance of Grandpa Glaux and the knowledge of Remembrance, we shall unravel the secrets of the Dreamscape.\"\" Mirror Princess led her Origami Birds into the wilderness to build the land, only to be shattered by pieces by monsters. \"\"Heh, don't worry so much. Family Head Kelbeck and his Lampmoths understand Trailblaze more than you do. Just prepare to add some new routes to her charts.\"\" Captain Revolver embarked on an adventure in a dark cave with the little butterflies, only to disappear into its abyssal depths. In the end, Clockie finds himself alone at the center of Dreamville.Tears stream down his face once more. \"I'm just a crybaby,\" he laments. \"If only I could be Brother Hanu!\" He tries to imitate Brother Hanu's *hmph*, but it doesn't sound cool at all. \"Tick-tock... No, no, if I were Brother Hanu, I wouldn't cry!\" \"But you're not him. You can't be like him.\"\"No, I'm not. I must surpass him.\" From that night forward, Clockie delves into Professor Owl's scrolls, determined to uncover the secrets of the desert. He retrieves Mirror Princess's map, seeking allies who can aid the town. And he grasps Captain Revolver's pistol and begins patrolling the town... \"Tick-tock. One day, I'll be even cooler than you!\" In Dreamville's desert, which is about to be explored, a cool figure is gazing at the dedicated Clockie and emits a cool *hmph*. \"A cool *hmph*.\""}

In 2147 Amber Era, he singlehandedly masterminded the tumult in the Montour System. He was eventually apprehended and sentenced by the IPC, and served his time in Asdana's frontier prison. Within just a few years of being sent to Asdana, he began to riot against the prison guards and ignited the rebellion that would be come to known as the War of Independence. At some point he awarded the Fanghunter Medal to Tiernan. During a defensive battle against the IPC, Hanunue was injured by multiple \"crocodile\" ships and crashed into the enemy's main ship. Infiltrating the vessel, he fought head-to-head with a person in high-grade IPC battlesuit and took over the mech, using its life support devices to heal his injuries. He then located the ship's command center and ammunition warehouse. The Watchmaker noted that even with enough ammunition, Hanunue could not destroy all the \"crocodile\" ships on his own, but the werewolf had a different idea \u2014 detonating the warehouse to cause a massive explosion. Despite the Watchmaker's pleas, Hanunue sacrificed himself to detonate the ammunition warehouse, destroying all the invading \"crocodiles\" and causing massive damage to the main ship. He sustained grave injuries and remained unconscious after he was recovered from enemy lines. To reassure the other rebels, the Watchmaker told them Hanunue was only temporarily out of action and would continue making significant decisions in Penacony. The Watchmaker later had a dream in which he and Hanunue had a conversation, the latter telling him \"as long as this is a dream, you'll have to wake up from it sooner or later.\" Hanunue presumably passed away after that dream."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=15257","text":"Heliobus The Heliobi, singular heliobus, also known as The Shapeless and Starfire Essence, are a shapeless species made of pure energy that appear as flames that are capable of cognizant speech. They like to parasitize physical bodies to experience the changes in the nervous system following different emotions to feed on them. Heliobi are ancient enemies of the Xianzhou Alliance and a rare species among the Denizens of Abundance, belonging to the order of Shapeless and the race of Extraneous Demons. Although the species were nearly wiped out toward the end of the Flaming Catastrophe, a small number of them could still be found on the Xianzhou Zhuming. Classification. Heliobi appear to be closely related to Wubbaboos, as the latter belong to to the Heliobus species of the Spirit Essence family and are categorized as Kingdom Spiritual Organisms, Class Astral Spirits, Order Shapeless. The planet they originate from is unknown. Behavior. Parasitism. Heliobi are pure energy entities without a set form. Records from other civilizations have named them \"The Shapeless\" or \"Starfire Essence.\" The heliobi love to parasitize others and control bodies, especially of sentient humanoid races, to experience through the various alterations of the nervous system triggered by emotions. This behavior of \"emotion consumption\" satiates them. The host will uncontrollably conduct stimulating behaviors \u2014 such as binge-eating, impulsiveness, self-mutilation, or destruction \u2014 to please the heliobi within them, in exchange for the heliobi's powerful abilities. They are also capable of making their hosts experience \"wild delusions.\" The process of heliobi taming the host's psyche is a process that expends the host's physical body without replenishment. Once a heliobus has possessed a host, it persistently disrupts the person's nervous system to speak with the host, then exploits the person's inner desires and vulnerabilities to induce hallucinations and provoke emotions. Initially, the host would only experience the emergence of an additional presence within their mind, another \"self\" that comprehends them and engages in conversations with them. However, as time passes (typically within a few days), the host will gradually lose the ability to distinguish whether their thoughts arise from their own brain or, instead, originate from the heliobus. Subsequently, the host becomes driven to fulfill their deepest desires to the fullest extent, regardless of how audacious or disruptive these may be. Warriors engage in fierce battles endlessly, epicureans indulge in excessive feasting, and the lustful completely surrender to their carnal desires... Under the compulsion of the heliobus, the humans host loses all semblance of self-control and morality, succumbing fully to their innermost desires. This process of gradual insanity is akin to the corruption known as \"mara.\" Towards the end of the possession process, the host's body will become completely drained by the heliobus, resulting in sudden spontaneous combustion. This outcome is often fatal for short-life species. Even without possession, people will deteriorate and die from exposure to heliobi who unconsciously consume their body. Heliobi perceive the emotions of their hosts in a manner similar to how humans perceive flavors, such as \"delicious,\" \"sour,\" \"sweet,\" or \"bitter\"... Heliobi possess the ability to easily discern the emotional states experienced by their hosts. They are drawn to individuals with intense desires, those who have undergone profound life experiences, and those harboring many unfulfilled wishes... Hosts possessing such properties are particularly enticing to heliobi due to the abundance of emotions and experiences they contain. However, it is worth noting that heliobi do not exhibit discernible preferences when selecting hosts, as evidenced by the distribution of victims in documented cases. Notably, heliobi display an aversion to possessing long-life species, considering the Xianzhou peoples \"indigestible\" when interrogated. It can be inferred that the longevity and robust physical resilience of long-life species hinder heliobi's ability to subjugate their hosts' will. Abundance. Though heliobi are recognized as an Abomination of Abundance, they rarely appeared as a part of the Denizens of Abundance's legions. On the contrary, they had once allied with Xianzhou, but only for a very short duration under specific circumstances. Culture. It has been at least six thousand years since the heliobi were subdued, making it virtually impossible to study their social organization. Some records indicate that individual heliobi can fuse with each other to create a bigger \"fire.\" They have a certain level of repulsion against advanced technical equipment, and have never developed any technology, due to the race's ability to manipulate energy. Heliobi appear to enjoy Phase Flame ash. Physiology. Appearance. When heliobi appear, electrical equipment will detect some sort of highly-intensive electromagnetic wave emission. As creatures of the Shapeless order, they can avoid the emission range of visible light and disappear from human sight. However, in situations when they need a host to notice them, they usually appear as a ball of heatless teal-colored \"fire.\" Abilities. Like how humans push physical objects, individual heliobi can also alter the energy balance of an area, freely converting energy from one type to another. By manipulating energy, they can create visual images, make fire or ice, and produce vibrations. This made heliobi appear as gods or demons to primitive civilizations. Based on the size of an individual's \"fire,\" one can judge the strength of that heliobus and how much energy it can master. Heliobi are able to merge together and combine their strength, as the heliobi which made up Ignamar once did in the fight against general Teng Xiao of the Luofu; however, when defeated, they scatter into fragments. As Starfire Essences, heliobi do not die, and the only permanent way to render them harmless is to trap them indefinitely. There are scant means to completely eradicate a heliobus, with the exception of harnessing its power as an inexhaustible energy source for perpetuity (the Creation Furnace within the Artisanship Commission was constructed for this purpose). The most efficacious approach to contend with a heliobus is to confine it within an intangible force field, separating it from other sentient beings. The Ten-Lords Commission will provide the frontline judges and spiritfarers on duty with sacred vessels explicitly crafted for capturing heliobi. Personality. As an individual heliobus possesses more and more hosts over time, it also slowly develops a personality and becomes distinctly different from its kin. The Ten-Lords Commission surmised that this race learns from the hosts' brains through their parasitism. By possessing their hosts, heliobi tap into the person's experiences and emotions, while also taking control of the person's body to fulfill their own desires. When a heliobus possesses a human host, it adopts the personality and behavioral patterns of that host, leading to the development of a distinct individual awareness that hinders bonding and \"fusion\" with other heliobi. According to ancient manuscripts, heliobi exhibit behaviors akin to swarms of bees. These fiery essences possess the ability to divide and merge, exchanging information and experiences with each other, and enhance their collective strength against adversaries. This process is known as heliobi homogenization. While heliobi that have merged together may still be perceived as individual entities, the conglomerate maintains internal hierarchies (reminiscent of ancient Xianzhou beliefs that attributed three souls and seven spirits within one humans). Within the cluster, certain heliobi specialize in combat, while others engage in contemplation and debate, and the most powerful oversees strategic coordination. Most heliobi struggle to cooperate harmoniously with each other due to how they've been tainted by human nature. This weakness can be exploited by posing complex and thought-provoking questions to them, causing them to splinter from within. However, ancient records mention the existence of formidable individual heliobi, such as the Flint Emperor and Phantylia. These individuals possess unwavering self-awareness and, over time, are able to resolve their internal differences and form an indissoluble whole (the heliobi call this process \"fusion\"). Weaker heliobi harbor immense fear of getting close to these great elder beings, for once absorbed, it will equals to the death of the weaker heliobus. History. The Lone Voyage Era. The Xianzhou first came to contact with the heliobi during the Lone Voyage Era, before the Xianzhou Natives turned into a long-life species. The Heliobi penetrated the ships' vaults to appear before the Xianzhou aristocrats, declaring themselves a shapeless and rootless race, beseeching Xianzhou to give them a safe berth. The species were adept at creating mirages and illusions to tempt humans. Thus, the people of Xianzhou became addicted to these wondrous creatures of pure energy and indulged in frolicking with them. The Possession Tragedy. The Heliobi soon exposed their true colors as the they tried to take humans' bodies, drain their emotions, and control their will. This was known as the Possession Tragedy, or the \"Occupation Tragedy,\" from which the Xianzhou Zhuming suffered the greatest. The Xianzhou artisans ultimately bound the heliobi within shapeless prisons and sentenced them to provide energy for Xianzhou for all eternity. During the Heliobi Wars, the Heliobi formed a red micro-star in an attempt to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad, led by an anonymous hero, believed to be Lan prior to their ascension to Aeonhood in certain myths, disassembled and weaponized the ship's auxiliary engines to fight them. The Xianzhou's suicide squad sent the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. The defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, was imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life. The people of the Zhuming are able to coexist with the heliobi without falling under their influence. The Flaming Catastrophe. The Flint Emperor\u2019s imprisonment lasted till the end of the second war against the wingweavers, when the hero broke the seal binding the rest of the heliobi, made an alliance with them, and relied on their power to defeat the army of Muldrasil. After that campaign, the heliobi were also severely diminished. The Flint Emperor was heavily wounded and left behind part of its body. Its leaders were once again imprisoned and sealed in the various Xianzhou ships' Shackling Prisons. There have been almost no traces of them found in the universe since, except on the Xianzhou Zhuming. It is rumored that the Creation Furnace in the Xianzhou Luofu is powered by an imprisoned heliobus. In recent history, Master Gongshu of the Luofu Artisanship Commission had developed a weapon that utilizes heliobus energy called the Luminflux Pyxis. Ambrosial Arbor Crisis. During the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis, the Lord Ravager Phantylia, a heliobus, infiltrated the Luofu disguised as Tingyun with the purpose of destroying the Luofu from the inside-out. She gave the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus a Stellaron and told them that the Ambrosial Arbor would bestow upon them undying bodies once it was revived. After Dan Shu, the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, was defeated by the Trailblazer, Phantylia discarded her disguise without leaving its remains behind and left in the form of a flame. Phantylia headed to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor and took control of its power and a body created by the Arbor. After the Trailblazers found her, a battle ensued where she tried to convert Jing Yuan into a member of the Antimatter Legion. In doing so, a mental link was formed between the two, allowing Dan Heng \u2022 Imbibitor Lunae to damage her by attacking Jing Yuan. After Phantylia was defeated, she taunted Jing Yuan before leaving. Other. Prior to Jing Yuan's promotion, the previous Luofu General, Teng Xiao, defeated a powerful heliobi known as Ignamar and sealed it away. Ignamar shattered into many smaller fragments of itself, after which they were all sealed in the Creation Furnace by the Ten-Lords Commission until it was damaged, setting the fragments free. Due to Ignamar's defeat, its fragments were unable to take on physical forms and wanted a rematch with the Luofu General. Most of these fragments would convene at Fyxestroll Garden. One of these fragments, Tail, refused to possess anyone and was on the brink of being extinguished when a young Foxian girl known as Huohuo came upon him. She decided to take the flame, resulting in Tail possessing her. Hanya, a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, soon arrived and realized she could not expel him without hurting Huohuo. She decided to seal him instead, and Tail would somewhat get along with Huohuo. After the Ambrosial Arbor crisis was resolved, the Trailblazer received a message from Guinaifen and arrived at the garden. Cirrus attempted to collect fragments to cause trouble; the first time it was foiled by Tail, and the second time by Jing Yuan after he agreed to battle it upon defeating his \"army\". Cirrus would later be sealed in the Suppression Tower, Verdant Terrace, though it still vowed to battle the Luofu General again."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=20486","text":"Heliobus Purging Manual Heliobus Purging Manual is a readable found aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. By the decree of the Ten Lords, we, the judges of the Interrogation Division, have reviewed many records regarding experiences in exorcising heliobi. These findings have been compiled into a comprehensive manual and distributed to the staff. We kindly request that you carefully study the contents of this manual in order to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for effectively exorcising heliobi. Q: What is a \"heliobus\"? Why is it not included in the Ten-Lords Commission Standard Exorcism Manual? A: Heliobi are rare, elusive, and shapeless entities. They are energy-based creatures devoid of a fixed shape, driven by the desire to possess the bodies of sentient beings and exert control over them. Further information regarding heliobi can be found in the \"List of Archenemies\". Heliobi re-emerged into the world after the Furnace was damaged. Millennia have passed since their last appearance, which caused the Possession Tragedy. During that era, the inhabitants of the Xianzhou were yet short-life species, and the Ten-Lords Commission had not yet been established. Heliobi have never harmed the Luofu since that Tragedy, and unfortunately, the Ten-Lords Commission has therefore become lax in our vigilance. At the time of the distribution of this manual, the Commission has initiated our contingency plan and integrated training on exorcising heliobi into the standard curriculum for judges. Q: What are their typical behavior patterns and weaknesses? A: According to ancient manuscripts, heliobi exhibit behaviors akin to swarms of bees. These fiery essences possess the ability to divide and merge, exchanging information and experiences with each other, and enhance their collective strength against adversaries. While heliobi that have merged together may still be perceived as individual entities, the conglomerate maintains internal hierarchies (reminiscent of ancient Xianzhou beliefs that attributed three souls and seven spirits within one humans). Within the cluster, certain heliobi specialize in combat, while others engage in contemplation and debate, and the most powerful oversees strategic coordination. Most heliobi struggle to cooperate harmoniously with each other due to how they've been tainted by human nature. This weakness can be exploited by posing complex and thought-provoking questions to them, causing them to splinter from within. However, ancient records mention the existence of formidable individual heliobi, such as the Flint Emperor from ancient times and the recent invader, Phantylia, who has been confirmed to have infiltrated the Xianzhou. These individuals possess unwavering self-awareness and, over time, are able to resolve their internal differences and form an indissoluble whole (the heliobi call this process \"fusion\"). Weaker heliobi harbor immense fear of getting close to these great elder beings, for once absorbed, it will equals to the death of the weaker heliobus. Q: What kind of hosts do heliobi prefer to possess? A: Heliobi are drawn to individuals with intense desires, those who have undergone profound life experiences, and those harboring many unfulfilled wishes... Hosts possessing such properties are particularly enticing to heliobi due to the abundance of emotions and experiences they contain. However, it is worth noting that heliobi do not exhibit discernible preferences when selecting hosts, as evidenced by the distribution of victims in documented cases. Notably, heliobi display an aversion to possessing long-life species, considering the Xianzhou peoples \"indigestible\" when interrogated. It can be inferred that the longevity and robust physical resilience of long-life species hinder heliobi's ability to subjugate their hosts' will. Q: What do heliobi seek through their possession? A: By possessing their hosts, heliobi tap into the person's experiences and emotions, while also taking control of the person's body to fulfill their own desires. When a heliobus possesses a human host, it adopts the personality and behavioral patterns of that host, leading to the development of a distinct individual awareness that hinders bonding and \"fusion\" with other heliobi. Based on our research, it has been observed that heliobi perceive the emotions of their hosts in a manner similar to how humans perceive flavors, such as \"delicious,\" \"sour,\" \"sweet,\" or \"bitter\"... Heliobi possess the ability to easily discern the emotional states experienced by their hosts. Q: How does heliobus possession negatively affect the host? A: According to the interview records of the victims, we deduce that once a heliobus has possessed a host, it persistently disrupts the person's nervous system to speak with the host, then exploits the person's inner desires and vulnerabilities to induce hallucinations and provoke emotions. Initially, the host would only experience the emergence of an additional presence within their mind, another \"self\" that comprehends them and engages in conversations with them. However, as time passes (typically within a few days), the host will gradually lose the ability to distinguish whether their thoughts arise from their own brain or, instead, originate from the heliobus. Subsequently, the host becomes driven to fulfill their deepest desires to the fullest extent, regardless of how audacious or disruptive these may be. Warriors engage in fierce battles endlessly, epicureans indulge in excessive feasting, and the lustful completely surrender to their carnal desires... Under the compulsion of the heliobus, the humans host loses all semblance of self-control and morality, succumbing fully to their innermost desires. This process of gradual insanity is akin to the corruption known as \"mara.\" The Interrogation Division believes this subject is worthy of further research. Towards the end of the possession process, the host's body will become completely drained by the heliobus, resulting in sudden spontaneous combustion. This outcome is often fatal for short-life species. Q: How does one eradicate a heliobus completely? A: According to the account of our ancestors, there are scant means to completely eradicate a heliobus, with the exception of harnessing its power as an inexhaustible energy source for perpetuity (the Creation Furnace within the Artisanship Commission was constructed for this purpose). The most efficacious approach to contend with a heliobus is to confine it within an intangible force field, separating it from other sentient beings. The Ten-Lords Commission will provide the frontline judges and spiritfarers on duty with sacred vessels explicitly crafted for capturing heliobi. Q: How does one exorcise a heliobus from a possessed host? A: The conventional technique of exorcism entails applying violence to the host that is suitable in scope and does not result in permanent damage, rendering the physical body incapacitated. In this case, the heliobus, unable to feel the emotions of the host, will naturally depart in search of other prey. Nevertheless, it is essential to reiterate that the responsibilities of a judge extend beyond the mere expulsion of malevolent spirits. We work to safeguard the ordinary everyday life of Xianzhou's people. We cannot demand that all judges forsake this method of exorcism, but we must earnestly implore each of you to consider the implications extremely carefully before resorting to such measures. Through the examination of successful exorcism cases, we have concluded that when the host becomes cognizant of the heliobus's encroachment and no longer remain obsessed with fulfilling their inner desires, they will have a chance of breaking free from the hallucinatory clutches imposed by the heliobus. In rare circumstances, the heliobus may voluntarily relinquish its hold on the host. ...&lt;br&gt;"}

Preface On that day, Scholar Cleo from the Candelagraphos asked me: \"Is there something you would like to write for the universe?\" I told her there was nothing, and she replied solemnly: \"Please, just write something. It's a request from the IPC.\" To be honest, I've never thought about this before. The Genius Society has its own rules and rarely ever shares anything with the outside world. Actually, why should we care about what happens to the universe? Our research and discoveries make us happy, and that's more than enough. Even if the galaxy were to go into all-out war, we would be able to take care of ourselves with our abilities \u2014 however, judging from a different perspective... What harm could it do even if I were to write a book? None that I could think of. In fact, I'm not the only one who's thought of publishing in the history of the Genius Society. Zandar, member #1 of the Genius Society, wrote a book before. Aiden, member #22 and inventor of the nine-worded formulae, also wrote a book. To my knowledge, Screwllum, member #76, also wrote a booklet a few Amber Eras ago to educate its butler on the maintenance of a large computer management system. Besides, the great Nous the Erudition also stored all the information within its body. Isn't this also a form of writing? Having thought of all this, I feel it would not be a bad thing to actually sit down and write a book of my own. The IPC sent someone last week to deliver the down payment for the book. I was shocked to see the number of zeros on it. I began to think seriously about writing. First, I need to explain the content of this book within this Preface: It will not contain any of my groundbreaking discoveries, nor will it have intrinsic mathematic deductions \u2014 though I am famous for the above, I wish to display my true self here. Truth be told, I want to write a book about the universe, Aeons, factions, and everything else. I have had more frequent interactions with other worlds in the past Amber Eras. I began to work with the IPC, assisted Xianzhou in their battle against the abominations, got my hands on numerous collections from the Astral Express, and stirred up some trouble with the Garden of Recollection. I've been more active recently than I have been ever before. I've noticed that the truly interesting things in the universe aren't its cold laws and rules, but the Aeons formed of highly condensed philosophy and the foolish conniving humans gathering around the Aeons. This is what I want to write: The lonesome gods and their insouciant followers. I hope the readers will find the book satisfying. Thank you IPC for your sponsorship. \"Genius Society\". Chapter 2: Genius Society Please consider the following question: What is the most mysterious organization in the entire universe? Is it the famous Stellaron Hunters who dare to work against the IPC? Is it the mysterious and unknown Device IX? Is it the Nameless that perished alongside Akivili? Or is it the Beyond the Sky Choir that only exists in legends? None of the above. In truth, the most mysterious, supernatural, and nebulous organization is the one that the author of this book belongs to: The \"Genius Society\" favored by the Aeon Nous. Firstly, let us state a universal truth: The author is a super genius of the kind only born once every few millennia, even on the scale of the entire universe. To reiterate, the author is not shameless, but shame means nothing to the author \u2014 The author had solved the solitary waves theory and the Spark model hypothesis at a very young age. As a young adult, the author discovered the conversion method for Sigma Baryons. The author proposed the Herta sequence and published a paper on reversed-progeria in middle age, and managed to conduct reversed-progeria in old age. In their regained youth, the author once again solved the secret behind the Imaginary leakage phenomenon, and captured and sealed the Stellaron from beyond the sky. The author had saved the planet they were on from total destruction for a total of nineteen times and has met the Aeons twice. The above is but a fraction of the author's innumerable accomplishments. Invitations to join the Genius Society are only handed out to individuals as rare as the author, and there have only been 84 of such illustrious members since the birth of Nous. Therefore, on the above evidence, the author deems the Genius Society as the most mysterious. In this book, for the first time ever, the enigmatic veil of the Genius Society will be lifted for the readers. (The draft ends here abruptly. Words are scribbled below: \"The people of this stupid society don't communicate with each other at all. What am I supposed to write about?\" An unfamiliar handwriting follows:\"Deary, you have to write something. The readers are looking forward to it.\" The familiar handwriting from Herta continues:\"If it's so easy, why don't you write it?\") \"Intelligentsia Guild\". Chapter 3: Intelligentsia Guild The universe is vast and without bounds, and the Erudition encompasses countless. Geniuses have their own ways with words as the ordinaries have their own self-satisfactions. Aside from those personally received by the Genius Society due to their extraordinary talents, there is another organization that is motivated by the Erudition and tirelessly continues its studies and research known as the Intelligentsia Guild. All personal bias aside, the hard work of the Intelligentsia Guild deserves a degree of respect. The Nous's club is filled with strange people, lunatics, lone wolves, anti-social geniuses, and people with social disorders. Though they continuously produced astonishing findings, they never share this knowledge with the outside world, let alone publish it. (With this book as an exception). The philosophy of the Intelligentsia Guild is to instead communicate and share: Knowledge is a type of hard currency and miracles are only brought about when currency is in circulation. So, they would exchange knowledge for wisdom and formulas for recipes. The IPC accepted and sponsored them in a very generous fashion, lending them the near-infinite powers of the IPC and the technology to move across worlds. The scholars traverse across many worlds and collect all the valuable knowledge, turning these into a commodity. The Intelligentsia Guild is more like a commerce group when compared to ordinary researchers. Their structure is built upon basic individual organizations of \"schools,\" each responsible for their own earnings and expenses. The scholars would research and trade the knowledge they've acquired in their area of expertise, trying to obtain truly priceless treasures this way. The following are a few more renowned schools for the reader's perusal: -Synesthesia School- The Synesthesia School is undoubtedly the school that has made the greatest contribution to the galaxy. For a very long time, communication has been a critical issue that has troubled the IPC. The foundation of any trade is its contract. However, the drafting of a contract requires mutual acknowledgment of its terms and there is a long and complicated list of languages spoken by intellectual lifeforms. The researchers of Synesthesia School worked to build a common thought bridge between the different species known as the Synesthesia Beacon that's widely used today. Thanks to the Synesthesia Beacon, all body movements, flash signals, sound vibrations, or the change in odor molecules \u2014 any sort of signal that holds meaning will be converted into a thought pulse and translated into a comprehensible language. The first obstacle of communication has been overcome. The IPC used the Synesthesia Beacon as the foundation and built a giant database, storing the speech and vocabulary of almost a hundred million languages. Inscriptions are no longer a mystery. It is said that the IPC is still paying the Synesthesia School a hefty licensing fee each quarter. This school has the wealth of a nation. A reliable contact has informed the writer that the next research topic of the Synesthesia School will be ultra-long-range remote communication technology. This technology was already invented by Elias Salas, member #56 of the Genius Society, and put into the use of the Genius Society over a hundred Amber Eras ago. But of course, the geniuses encourage the average Joe to continue to develop their own erudition. -Astral Ecology School- This school views the galaxy as a large ecological observation subject. They are obsessed with studying the void song whale, radiant jellyfish, and other organisms of the galaxy. The school earned its recognition for the discovery of the Celestial Comet Wall. The IPC was exhilarated to hear the confirmation that this was an ancient creation of Qlipoth, Aeon of Preservation. They paid the school an incredibly large sum of money, once again proving the old saying of \"work smart, not hard\" to be correct. -Candelagraphos- The Candelagraphos is the printing department of the guild. They are made of countless authors, transcribers, typists, programmers, and workers who produce books. This school is founded upon the noble gesture of altruism, surrendering selfish scientific research and throwing themselves at the grand service of sharing wisdom with more people. The science of the Intelligentsia Guild is gathered here and organized into books to be published and sold to all the worlds. The most famous series is definitely the Traveler's Guide. -Armed Archaeologists- This is a school passionate about galactic exploration and archaeology. They are always heading to the most desolate planets and exploring the most dangerous ruins. Try to imagine a group of scholars armed to the teeth leading a dozen mercenaries out of an exploration vessel and crawling in and out of the crevices of ancient buildings that have been forgotten for countless Amber Eras. They would leave behind the few fools that accidentally triggered various traps as an offering. Upon reaching their destination, they would dig up valuable artifacts and ancient writing before calmly laying down explosives and opening a path made from total destruction. They would then happily board their ship and leave... Some say they look more to be mercenaries than scholars, but that's up to each person to interpret. -Quantum History School- This is a new school reformed from the bankrupted Psychology History School. Its original purpose is to find the influences of disturbance and patterns of change hidden throughout history, and then make predictions for the future. However, they've become a group of scammers that use a series of complex \"calculations\" for fortune-telling. The reason I've included this school is to wrap up this interesting piece of writing with a funny joke. \"Interastral Peace Corporation\". Chapter 2634: Interastral Peace Corporation Qlipoth, the Amber Lord \u2014 a colossal statue without a head. Silent and oblivious, THEY only think about constructing THEIR mysterious and giant wall. What was it for? No one knows. What is it THEY're trying to keep out? No one knows. Most normal people will ignore it after realizing our ignorance, but there are always abnormal people in this world. There are two different types even in that group. One type thinks that: \"Wow, there's a God building a wall \u2014 this means walls are sacred \u2014 so we're going to build walls too!\" What kind of ridiculous logic is this? And with that, this group of people believes they've received some sort of revelation and began wasting precious resources to build useless things on their respective planets. These people are known as the Architects. As for the other group, well, they're even dumber than the Architects. Although the Architects have a few screws loose in their heads, they're at least thinking about doing things that are beneficial to themselves. On the contrary, the other group of people think that: \"Wow, there's a God building a wall \u2014 this means walls are sacred \u2014 so we have to help God build walls!\" \u2014 Whaa? And with that, a group of people filled with a self-sacrificing mentality gathered and formed a support team for Qlipoth. Knowing that they're not exactly capable of doing anything, this support team used the power of Paths and flew to different worlds to source the various materials needed for building a wall as a tribute to the God. At this very moment, two intelligent individuals emerged from this group of imbeciles and changed the destiny of the entire galaxy. And now, the writer will explain the events to follow in detail. First, the support team flew to an unfamiliar planet. They were lucky to find the planet inhabited by a friendly race who received them warmly. The support team said: \"Respected companions of the galaxy! The galaxy is facing destruction and our Aeon is building a wall spanning across light-years to protect the galaxy. We urge you to take part and join in on the construction!\" The aliens reply, smiling: \"Wow, that sounds extraordinary. What can we do to help?\" The support team says: \"We need wood, stone, rebars, cement, titanium... anything and everything that can be used in construction, we want them all.\" The aliens reply: \"Good, we have a lot of those materials. What will you use to trade for them?\" And this is when the first landmark of economics was born: The trade of resources\u2014 The support team says: \"Oh, we have a lot of wood, stone, rebars, cement, titanium... anything and everything that can be used to build stuff, we have it all.\" The alien replies: \"This kind of trade would be pointless.\" And this is when the wise ones take the stage. Today, both of their names are inscribed into each wall and ceiling panel in the IPC: Louis Fleming and Dongfang Qixing. The wise ones quickly answer: \"There is a planet called Clementine three systems from here. It has a local specialty called winter sun fruit that is incredibly delicious and melts in your mouth.\" The two upsold the berry as if it were something that fell out of heaven. The alien replies: \"Wow, that sounds amazing. Okay, five hundred kilograms of wood for five hundred kilograms of winter sun fruit.\" And this is when resource gained a quantitative value \u2014 \"Winter sun fruits are extremely precious.\" Wise man number one Louis Fleming says, \"An entire Amber Era wouldn't yield five hundred kilograms of it! On the contrary, five hundred kilograms of wood means very little to you. How about this, we'll trade five kilograms of winter sun fruit for your five hundred kilograms of wood. I guarantee you'll love it!\" Dear readers, this conversation took place nearly 800 Amber Eras ago. I'm sure you can tell that wise man number one was being completely dishonest. Though winter sun fruits may be delicious, it is nowhere near as rare as he described it to be. The wise man was lying. He was able to do this because he had the ultimate advantage or asymmetric information. Once one party has more information than the other, then they will gain the absolute initiative. When applied to this specific incident, it meant that wise man number one possessed the power to set prices. And with that, things start to develop in a positive direction: The support team realized that they need to provide and trade with merchandise that the other party is interested in for them to get the resources that they want. The support team no longer purchases only construction materials but start to buy food, drinks, clothes, and everyday goods... They bought everything that other planets would be interested in. The more business they did, the bigger their business grew. Intellect number two Dongfang Qixing realized something: If they're the only people in the entire galaxy that are in the trade business, then it's time for them to set their own rules. \u2014 And with that, the galactic currency was born \u2014 More than seven hundred and seventy Amber Eras ago, Louis Fleming and Dongfang Qixing announced the reformation of the support team and started the Interastral Peace Corporation (IPC). At the same moment, the IPC introduced the universal galactic currency: credits. Ever since that day, the people of each planet never had to worry about how much they could trade for their local specialties \u2014 everything already had a price tag attached to it! They would receive credits from the IPC and use the credits to purchase merchandise from the IPC. The market is no longer comprised of three parties with the IPC in the middle. Now, people can purchase goods directly from the IPC. Although the sellers and buyers didn't change much, this actually forms a great advantage for the IPC. The buyer and seller asset movement seems to have come to a halt. \u2014 Halted asset means that there are now deposit capital \u2014 Assets valued in the trillions have suddenly become hidden behind the IPC's credits and immediately filled the IPC's pockets, but the IPC has bottomless pockets! And just like that, the IPC turned from being just a small organization sourcing materials for an Aeon to the strongest force in the entire galaxy. However, it is worth mentioning that even after having made such a great accomplishment, the IPC never forgot why the organization was put together in the first place. The construction materials the IPC has accumulated over nearly 800 Amber Eras are now piled across each planet surrounding Aeon Qlipoth. The Aeon has never uttered a word about their actions, nor made any use of their offerings. Even so, the IPC's outlook remains unwavering: This is what you call faith."}

Madam Herta was once very troubled by the huge collection of items spread across the cosmos. Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself. The generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research. The IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research. Most of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research. However, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen. Light from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull \u2014 for the stars were journeying with them. Despite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way \u2014 The cosmos a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection."}

The space station endured and survived many a crisis due to being owned by Madam Herta. Laden with the rarest items in the entire universe like a feast set before ravenous guests, the space station was never free from threats or unwanted attention. Relying on the security personnel hired by the IPC and a somewhat advanced defensive system proved insufficient to handle the hostility from the stars... Madam Herta once made prescient judgment and steered the station away in an elegant curve, ending a conspiratorial attempt to assault the station before it even initiated. As for her mastery in gathering intel to solve crises, she simply described it as \"I spend time brewing coffee while others are reading books.\" Rather than thieves who intend to steal its collection or mysterious factions with unknown objectives, the main threat faced by the space station remains its owner. The station could immediately fall into disaster if she ever had a wild idea. Curios that simulate a stellar collapse, a distorted gravitational field caused by the collision of dark galaxies... Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them. Hence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall. Senior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets. The space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue. Just like a pebble pushed out onto the smooth surface of a frozen lake, the station will continue to glide evenly and steadily in complete silence."}

Researchers from different planets comes to work here as a researcher and most of them are faithful followers of Herta. Qualifying for a researcher role in the Herta Space Station is a hard process and is a cherished goal of the scientific community. It is the first world that can be accessed upon starting the game. The Trailblaze Mission chapter Today Is Yesterday's Tomorrow takes place in this world. Zones. The Master Control Zone can be detached from the station, capable of traversing the Cosmos on its own. It serves as the brain of operations when attached to the main body of the space station. On both sides of the master control zone and at its entrance is a huge wall consisting of numerous screens for surveillance. This system offers visuals on everything happening on the parameter of the space station with no blind spot. The system also boasts a sniper platform with roadblocks, capable of handling unknown threats, and a defense projection platform that can generate an anti-gravity shield over the space station. The watcher zone is used to monitor the real-time status of the station's energy supply and the conditions of other zones. Together with the master control zone, these two areas form the core of the space station, offering an integrated system with strong capacities for observing, monitoring, defense, and attack. The Base Zone is the core section between the two-stage structure separating the starship and the space station. It is the section where researchers partake in their primary daily activities. The reception center is located in the base zone, at the back of the space elevator. It is the first room to greet the station's visitors. Many people come here to see its splendor for themselves, but they are not allowed any further, and can only watch the proud researchers with admiration. The Medical Cabin is the medical facility and pride of the space station, said to be able to drag anyone back from the brink of death. Research projects in the station are always accompanied by unknown risks, and therefore the medical cabin is packed at all times. The Storage Zone is used to house curios. Gigantic pathways can be found in the center, snaking through the upper and lower level rooms where different departments store their collections. The Gallery of Shadow is Madam Herta's personal gallery, sealed away all year round, and only Herta herself has access to entry. To the researchers, the gallery is no more than something to base their stories on, but it was opened by the Stellaron Hunters in order to place the Stellaron being stored there inside the Trailblazer during the Antimatter Legion attack. The Supply Zone is the logistics hub of the space station. It has all manner of resources stored within its confines, supervises an energy core, and its equipped with a fully established railway platform. It stands as an essential junction for operations and maintenance aboard the space station. If things ever got out of hand and the master control zone was doomed to be destroyed, researchers would take the evacuation route and rush towards the supply zone, where all the external relief ships are docked along the Railway Platform. The Seclusion Zone used to be a major research facility for cutting-edge experimentation, offering convenient conditions for high-risk experiments conducted between the shuttles, laboratories, and the greenhouse. The zone sealed off after Ruan Mei began to conduct her experiments, which resulted in a Swarm outbreak along with a clone of the Emanator of Propagation, . The Trailblazer investigated this zone on Ruan Mei's behalf during one of her rare visits to the station, during which the clone emerged from the incubator and fought them. However, it died off after 56 seconds, unable to sustain its own existence. While the Swarm still has a small presence in the area, it is now primarily occupied by Ruan Mei's Creations, who mostly reside in the Breeding Ground and Pharmaceutical Room."}

The messenger, Think-Tank, will ask the player how to improve the Hexanexus, so that more people attempt to complete them. Afterwards, the puzzle will change to include symbols that need to face in a specific direction for the puzzle to be completed. New Hexanexus will now appear in various areas with the updated design. After completing the subsequent set of 15 Hexanexus, the Hex Club will message the player again, saying that the results of the new test were mixed, and that they're considering adding a storyline to make the marketing more interesting. Upon giving them some ideas, the Hex Club will bid the player farewell until \"the next version.\" Gameplay Notes. Initial. Hexanexus puzzles involving rotating a central block so that the plates on the sides match where the \"shadow\" of the central block would be, if light was shining on the central block from the left and right. When the block is in the correct position, the plates on the side will glow golden. After Story. After completing the mini-quest related to the Hexanexus, the new ones will additionally have symbols that need to line up and face in the correct direction."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=14765","text":"High-Cloud Quintet The High-Cloud Quintet was a legendary group of five heroes in Xianzhou history. They were led by Jingliu, the previous Sword Champion of The Xianzhou Luofu. However, they disbanded less than a hundred years after their group's formation. Description. The High-Cloud Quintet was made up of five members from different Xianzhou ships: Using what he had learned from his time with the Xianzhou, Yingxing forged four powerful weapons that came to be used by the other members of the High-Cloud Quintet. History. Formation. In their heyday, the High-Cloud Quintet were close friends and the heroes of the Xianzhou. Jingliu recruited the other four, with Jing Yuan (still just a boy at the time of inception, though later shown to be an adult) implied to be the last to join. They were initially gathered to save the Xianzhou Yuque from an assault by the Denizens of Abundance. Other feats that the Quintet accomplished in their short span included defeating the borisin at Thalassa, destroying the alliance between the Houyhnhnms and the wingweavers in the Abundance Axis, and defeating the living planet Ketu Mirage. Sedition and Dissolution. The group came to an end more than 700 years before the main story, in Year 7379 Star Calendar, when Baiheng sacrificed herself in a great battle against Shuhu. In an attempt to resurrect Baiheng, and also to solve the Vidyadharas' reproduction problem, Dan Feng committed a great sin that was known as the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae. Upset by the endless cycle of death that war brought about, he used the Transmutation Arcanum to resurrect Baiheng, while also allowing other races to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara species. However, his tampering ended up creating an uncontrolled draconic abomination that wrought great destruction to the Scalegorge Waterscape. Yingxing assisted Dan Feng in the resurrection process by using Shuhu's flesh; however, his involvement backfired on him, and he was transformed into an immortal being struck with mara. Even though Jingliu did not assist them, she also developed mara as a result of the incident. By using torn fabric from the edge of her skirt as a makeshift blindfold, Jingliu was able to keep her mara in check as she defeated the draconic beast. Aftermath. While Jing Yuan\u2019s involvement with this incident was minimal, he is said to have understood the \u201cprice\u201d better than anyone, though he did not intervene. Only one year after the Sedition, in Year 7380 Star Calendar, Jingliu fully succumbed to her mara and went on a murderous rampage until she was finally defeated by Jing Yuan. Following this incident, she left the Xianzhou and her name was erased from the Luofu's public records, with the title of Sword Champion said to have been vacant since the Sedition. As a result of the Sedition, Bailu was chosen to be Dan Feng's successor as the next High Elder. Dan Feng, meanwhile, was imprisoned and sentenced to a forced molting rebirth. His next incarnation, Dan Heng, was kept in the Shackling Prison for an unknown period of time, occasionally visited by Jing Yuan, before eventually being escorted out and exiled from the Luofu. After Dan Heng\u2019s exile, he traveled across the universe, still only a teen (presumably by Vidyadhara rather than mortal standards). All the while, he was hunted by the person who used to be Yingxing, who was determined to show him what the pain of death feels like as retribution for his past life\u2019s crimes. Amidst Dan Heng's travels, he chanced on the Astral Express Crew, incidentally saving them by defeating huge monsters in the path of the Express. Himeko offered to take him in under the guise of being the train's guard and archivist. While Dan Heng has managed to kill Blade and escape many times over, he still lives in fear of him, having nightmares about his endless pursuit. After Yingxing's transformation, he left the Xianzhou, presumably through exile, as he is considered a wanted criminal aboard the ship. For an unknown period of time, he was taught swordsmanship by Jingliu and was also killed by her a hundred times over. Following this, he pursued Dan Feng's reincarnation Dan Heng across the cosmos, always fighting him every time they met. He came to forget his name, abandoning his previous identity and growing progressively more disheveled until he was found by the Stellaron Hunters some centuries later and persuaded by Sam and Kafka to join them. While he still seemingly considers himself to be unnamed, Kafka took his new identity as a blade literally, referring to him as \u201cBladie\u201d from their first meeting and effectively treating it as his name, something he was apparently amenable to and allowed others to follow suit in (though only without the diminutive nickname). After the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, and the exiles of Jingliu and Yingxing, Jing Yuan was named the Arbiter-General of the Luofu Cloud Knights, a position he still holds today, though he may someday retire and pass his title to the young Master Diviner, Fu Xuan. He took on a disciple, Yanqing, who was named a Cloud Knight Lieutenant in Year 8096 Star Calendar, much like Jing Yuan was in the days of the High-Cloud Quintet. He also takes it upon himself to check up on Bailu occasionally, faking illnesses as an excuse to visit her, asking after her health and of any dreams she\u2019s had recently. Stellaron Crisis. In Year 8100 Star Calendar, after a Stellaron was smuggled onto the Xianzhou Luofu, Blade and the other Stellaron Hunters boarded the ship in pursuit of it. Blade was captured by the Cloud Knights and brought to the Shackling Prison to be interrogated by Jing Yuan, but managed to escape at a later time. The Astral Express Crew eventually boarded the Luofu in order to resolve the Stellaron crisis and clear the Stellaron Hunters' name of any involvement. Despite Dan Heng's banishment from the ship, he decided to tail his companions out of concern for their well-being. Once aboard the Luofu, Dan Heng traveled with Sushang, a Cloud Knight transferee, and Luocha, a traveling merchant in the hopes of reuniting with his friends. When they reached the Alchemy Commission, Dan Heng slipped away from the others and boarded a starskiff to the Scalegorge Waterscape. There, he encountered Kafka and Blade, though his confrontation with the latter was interrupted by Yanqing. Blade proceeded to reveal Dan Heng's true identity as Imbibitor Lunae by stabbing him in the chest. When Yanqing tried to capture both of them, Blade and Dan Heng briefly fought side-by-side to defeat him. After the fight ended, Jing Yuan appeared and dismissed the Stellaron Hunters. He and Dan Heng continued deeper into the delve to meet up with the Astral Express Crew. Calling upon his powers from his previous incarnation, Dan Heng parted the waters of Scalegorge Waterscape to clear a path to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor. After removing the seals on the Arbor, the group confronted Lord Ravager Phantylia. Dan Heng and Jing Yuan managed to defeat her vessel by coordinating their attacks, with the powers of Dan Heng's Cloudhymn Roar and Jing Yuan's Lightning Lord, though Jing Yuan was injured in the battle and had to spend time away from his duties to recuperate. During his leave of absence, he appointed Master Diviner Fu Xuan to temporarily take on his responsibilities. Post-Crisis. Due to Dan Heng's part in resolving the Stellaron crisis, Jing Yuan revoked his banishment decree, allowing him to come and go freely on the Luofu. Dan Heng later met with the Luofu's current High Elder, Bailu, and together they repaired the seal on the Ambrosial Arbor. Some time later, Jingliu arrived on the Luofu and turned herself in to the Cloud Knights for arrest, but requested one day of freedom before her trial. She sent an anonymous letter to Dan Heng, who went to the Seat of Divine Foresight with the intention of asking Jing Yuan about the letter, but instead encountered Jingliu. The two of them, accompanied by Yanqing, who was ordered to keep an eye on the criminal Jingliu, first visited the Stargazer Navalia. Jingliu revealed that the reason she wanted to come to this area was to pay tribute to Baiheng with a soul-soothing ceremony. After manufacturing a starskiff and sending it off to the stars with Baiheng's flagon, the trio passed through the Artisanship and Alchemy Commissions. They then met with Jing Yuan and Blade at the Scalegorge Waterscape, where the general was interrogating Luocha's involvement in the Stellaron crisis. Yanqing escorted Luocha away, leaving the High-Cloud Quintet members alone. According to Jingliu, the members of the Quintet all made a promise to each other 700 years ago \u2014 that no matter what happened, the five of them would always gather at Scalegorge Waterscape and share a drink. Jingliu reflected on the group's unhappy fate, reiterating that \"Of five people, three must pay the price,\" and musing in what specific ways each person will pay their price: Dan Heng will forever bear the shadow and sins of his past self, Blade will experience only murder and his own death for the rest of his life, and Jingliu will face the punishment of the Xianzhou Alliance before \"paying an even worse price.\" She then bid the High-Cloud Quintet a final farewell. Before she left, Jingliu fulfilled Blade's promise of one last attempt to end his life. They dueled, with Jingliu emerging victorious once again, and everyone went their separate ways. Weapons. Four members of the Quintet used weapons forged by Yingxing, which were his most famous creations:"}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=17491","text":"High Elders The High Elders are the leaders of the Vidyadhara of the Xianzhou Alliance. There are five High Elders, who each lead their respective clans. Some time after the exodus of the Vidyadhara from their homeworld, they made an agreement with the Xianzhou Alliance who offered their people a new home, and migrated to five of the six Xianzhou ships. They are responsible for keeping watch over the plaguemarks, also known as Traces of Abundance, that exist on each Xianzhou ship. Plaguemarks. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara, and the five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, High Elder of the Luofu at the time, made the decision to flood Scalegorge Waterscape with the waters of the ancient sea in order to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor. The statue at Dragonvista Rain Hall was erected in honor of this. As a reward for their watch over the plaguemarks, the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Xianzhou Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship. Succession. The high elder is considered the existence closest to the Permanence among the Vidyadhara. They are able to turn into dragons. The power was a rare inheritance that could only be passed down to those who successfully completed numerous rites and challenges, during which their physical features slowly transformed to resemble their predecessors. The succession involves a secret ritual known as the Transmutation Arcanum and a treasure known as the dragon heart. Once the succession is completed, the former High Elder undergoes a hatching rebirth while the new High Elder begins to display dragonic features. Dan Feng used the Transformation Arcanum as the means for resurrecting someone. The ritual failed, resulting in his healing powers going to Bailu while his destruction powers remained with his reincarnation, Dan Heng. Dan Heng also retained fragmented memories from his past life. Jingliu suspects that the Preceptors tampered with the molting rebirth causing these circumstances. Jing Yuan also suggests that the Preceptors denied Dan Heng a true rebirth. The Transmutation Arcanum is said to contain a secret which allows the Vidyadhara to escape the cycle of reincarnation and return to a natural reproduction cycle. A draconic abomination was born in the process of Dan Feng's failed resurrection using the Transmutation Arcanum. The Vidyadhara Preceptors sought the Transmutation Arcanum from Dan Feng because they saw the draconic abomination as a sign of the ritual's success. The old chief alchemist saw \"that little girl\" as the key to the Transmutation Arcanum and the draconic abomination as a step to solving the Vidyadhara's inability to reproduce. According to her, Dan Feng's changes to the Transmutation Arcanum created the draconic abomination, which was also a new life and the hope that will allow the Vidyadhara to one day reproduce. The process involves incorporating the flesh of other species to unlock the potential of Long's blood. Dreams. High Elders are able to re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives after receiving the Orb of Abysm and the Transmutation Arcanum. The dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand but it is the closest they come to Permanence. Yunyou reported to the Vidyadhara Preceptors that Bailu did not have dreams and believed that this was because her dragon heart was damaged and the Transmutation Arcanum had not been successfully completed. However Bailu later reveals that she did indeed have dreams, but refused to tell anyone about them. Abilities. The High Elders have the power to summon the forces of nature. Bailu was able to call down lightning and command the waters at an early age. The Preceptors shackled her tail with the Dragonhorn Pilory to prevent her from losing control of her powers. The Luofu High Elder can seal and unseal the Ambrosial Arbor."}

POM-POM'S INTEL HONKAI STARRAIL EMANATOR SPECIAL Issue 07 Pom-Pom's Exclusive Intel Page 2. HONKAI STARRAIL EMANATOR SPECIAL Issue 07 I'll be the acting chief editor for this issue to educate you on some essential information, Trailblazers. You mentioned wanting to learn more about Emanators, so I've compiled all relevant information from the data bank. I hope this will help. What is an Emanator? If mortals receiving the grace of Aeons and grasping the power of Paths are viewed as singular shattered foam, then the mighty feats of Aeons driving their Paths onwards can be likened to a towering tsunami that engulfs mountains. In this empty stellar vastness, a small number of favored mortals can also draw upon the power of the Paths with the permission of the Aeons, creating huge waves that erode the coast. They are referred to as \"Emanators\". While not completely subservient to the Aeons, Emanators are as good as emissaries of the Aeons' wills in everyone else's eyes. Page 3. How to become an Emanator. Different Aeons have different attitudes towards THEIR Emanators, so the method through which THEY grant power and the extent of the power also varies significantly. Some Aeons regard Emanators as an extension of THEMSELVES, some Aeons have no intention of creating Emanators, and there are even Aeons who just do as THEY please. Emanator's Status. Factions that worship martial strength will view the Emanator's status as a banner, using it as a show of their influence. However, some forces view the acquisition and control of information in higher regard, intentionally concealing the Emanator's existence. There are also Emanators who blend into the crowd, pretending to be ordinary mortals before they reveal their powers. But there is one undeniable fact: Along each Path, the distances that Emanators stride far surpass that of their mortal Pathstriding counterparts. And on this journey, their mere existence becomes the drive of the continuation, extension, and expansion of their Paths. Rumors about Emanators across the universe are rife, and they should not all be believed. Here, I will list some reputable sources that may hopefully educate you. Page 4. Appendix. Antimatter Legion. A Lord Ravager is both the Emanator of Nanook of Destruction and a commander of the Antimatter Legion. For those capable individuals who obey The Blemished One's will or even willingly step onto the Path of Destruction, the Aeon will spare their lives and delay their annihilation. Endowed with the power of Destruction and twisted by it, these creatures manage to endure the glance of a god without dying from the power, then turining into Lord Ravagers dreaded by all. It is said that there are a total of seven Lord Ravagers under Nanook. They are the executioners of Destruction's will, all artistes of war, every inch of their being honed into ultimate, burning weapons. They bring about the apocalypse that traverses stars, imposing the absolute concept of Destruction via myriad ideals. Page 5. Appendix. The Xianzhou Alliance. In an ancient era of legends, Xianzhou ships were tasked with voyaging across the stars to search for the miracle medicine of immortality. After wearing away its conviction and shape over the long years, the Xianzhou eventually encountered Yaoshi. However, all that the bestowal of immortality brought upon them were sorrows, poverty, endless war, and death. It wasn't until Lan, the Aeon of The Hunt, returned from the Abyss. Using gravity as bowstring and stars as arrows, Lan shattered the Ambrosial Arbor and put the wickedness of Abundance to an end. After Xianzhou returned to the righteous path, it formed an alliance under the guidance of The Hunt and formed a powerful army known as the Cloud Knights. The Alliance's goals were to patrol the world and eradicate all Abominations of Abundance, and put an end to the corruption of the undead. The generals who command each Xianzhou, along with the marshal of the Alliance, take up arms themselves, embarking on the irrevocable path of pursuit, becoming the sharp arrows of the Reignbow. Page 6. Appendix. The Family. The concept of Harmonic Strings is defined in the Harmony Hymns - they are the multiple embodiments of Xipe the Great One, the down-to-earth virtues that enable harmony. Regardless of whether you place yourself under The Family's rule, the Aeon will look favorably upon you as long as you carry out these good deeds. On worlds ruled by The Family, members often gather in large groups to engage in virtuous acts and play harmonious music. The thousands of tiny ropes come together to form a united string, welcoming the Embodiment of Harmony to manifest on the mortal plane. The Family never shied away from promoting the great names of the embodinment of the thousand-faced god, such as Aelenev the commander of the Eternal Centurion, Dominicus the wisher of the Harmonious Choir, Constantina the singer of the Panacoustic Theater, and Beatriz the merrymaker of the Blissful Ball... However, few have witnessed THEIR radiant presence going beyond the boundaries of The Family. Some also argue that the Harmonic Strings are nothing short of the Emanators of Xipe - These do not follow any specific mortal but are facets of Xipe, and can assume the form of any Family member when necessary. Page 7. Appendix. Interastral Peace Corporation. As the largest financial body of the cosmos and a disciple of the Amber Lord, most believe that the Preservation's Emanators exist within the IPC. However, according to the Express' current data bank intel, only two Emanators of Preservation are confirmed - Taravan Keane of the seven Board of Trustees members and Diamond, chief of the Strategic Investment Department. Information on others are locked behind layers of encryption, with no other sources available. There is another group named the Ten Stonehearts, an elite team reporting directly to Diamond. The official title within the corporation for this role is called Non-Performing Asset Liquidation Specialist - its members' origins are varied, its responsibilities differ, with multiple people's records shuffling in and out of this role. The only commonality they share is that they were personally selected by Diamond, and conferred with the name and status of \"Cornerstone.\" Some credible sources suggest that the Ten Stonehearts have demonstrated unbelievable power related to Preservation on certain occasions. Whether this power originates from the members themselves or the Cornerstones they possess remains uncertain. However, since Diamond is one of the few confirmed Emanators of Preservation within the IPC, this power is likely related to that fact. Page 8. Appendix. Self-Annihilator. Self-Annihilators are a group that lost their meaning of existence when they carelessly stepped into IX the Nihility's shadow. The shadow of the Nihility covers the stars equally, and Self-Annihilators may form in any world. These poor souls share one thing in common: Their various existential properties - such as corporeal body, mental cognition, and personal memories... will gradually fade away in their journey of self-annihilation. Some Self-Annihilators have their skin turned into something like rotten wood, full of holes and scars. Some have their endocrine system disrupted, becoming unable to distinguish between pleasure and pain and turning numb to everything. Some lose their memories, others lose their senses... It is as if they have been deprived of the meaning of their lives by some entity, and can only keep watching in dreams and illusions as their own forms disappear into a black hole at the end of the horizon. However, some Self-Annihilators would conceive the idea of fighting back. They join the Doctors of Chaos, vowing to do their best to cure others of Nihility in what little time they have left in exchange for their own redemption. Moreover, some of them rely on their strong convictions to try to break the curse of Nihility at its root - by slaying the Aeon that slumbers in the abyss. Dr. Primitive, No. #64 of the Genius Society, once asked before his disappearance: If IX is truly unresponsive to the universe, how could the Path of Nihility exist to this day? Perhaps, as the Self-Annihilators aimlessly traverse the cosmos, they are also casting the shadow of the Aeon around the universe. As for the few who can single-handedly withstand the encroachment of Nihility on their existences, their journey to self-annihilation is drawn out to infinity, and the road they walk is like a shadow of IX cast in the world."}

After his capture and imprisonment, the Abundance Axis coalition greatly declined in strength. Hoolay was muzzled, shackled, fettered, and placed in a straight jacket before being sentenced to imprisonment. He was held accountable for numerous acts of invasions, associated war crimes, and for long-term enslavement of Foxians and utilizing their blood for alchemical purposes. His confinement became the foundation of the alliance between the Xianzhou and the Foxians, and individuals who objected to this sentence would be punished for \"Sowing Discord\". The terms of his imprisonment was that he was to be subjected to the punishment of the Forest of Swords and never be pardoned. His place of detention is also changed on a yearly basis, and the new location was to remain unknown to individuals below the rank of Cloud Knight Lieutenant or Judge.

As the hunter sent by the association, Hugh went to the south of the mountain after receiving the rescue call. Never did he expect to walk right into an ambush long in the planning. After waking up from a long shock induced by gunshots, Hugh immediately realized he just barely escaped death. However, he also realized his plight was far from over, for Artaius was staring right at him. Despite the short range and fast pace, some of Artaius' messy attacks were bound to miss... Hugh calmly waited for an opening, then he whipped out his bone blade soaked in poison and jumped up for an extraordinary strike in the blink of an eye. Their positions as the predator and the prey were reverted. After removing Artaius' head and fur, he managed to survive the first night in snow despite his untreated gunshot wounds.

At that moment, their horror surpassed their shock. The beasts that Hugh had hunted down numbered in the thousands, each and every one of which was uniquely precious. Only by reaching a thorough understanding of the prey's traits and habits would a hunter truly achieve the full completion of a hunt... For Hugh, the Lord of the Ice Lake was the last piece in the puzzle that was the Snow Plains. Hence, he must finish the hunt, to bring his Hunter's Soul to completion. And now, the highest prized bounty was put on the head of Hugh the Hunter, instead of the Lord of the Ice Lake, marking the beginning of a hideous all-out hunt.

Registered hunters, however, couldn't wait that long. They decided to march into the snowy mountains to hunt down Hugh and neutralize this approaching threat. Though there were many exceptionally powerful talents among the register hunters of the association, they were never comrades who had each other's back. Hunters congregated only for the hefty prize of the bounty, and would betray one another without hesitation for the right price. After all, anything could happen on these desolate plains... As long as the old hunter Hugh was taken care of, everyone would earn more bounty. That was their consensus, for which they paid the price. Hugh made more than enough preparations. Hunting the top hunters would be no easier a task than hunting monsters. Hugh must be more patient than ever, for patience was always the most valued trait in a hunter.

Hugh pointed his hunting rifle straight at the dying elk. Looking at those awe-inducing eyes, he thought those reminded him of his own. Ever since the ambush by the registered hunters, Hugh's life force had already become depleted like a dying candle in the wind. He was sharply aware that the only reason he managed to survive was due to his unyielding desire for revenge. Should it become satiated, his life would instantly come to an end, scattered like snowflakes... Despite his heavy footsteps, Hugh's large soft elk-skin boots did not leave any prints on the ground. He must stay sharp for the last hunt of his life. Amid panic and hysteria, the Hunters Association began to crumble. They began to purge traitors in haste, hoping it could grant them Hugh's mercy.

I fantasized about what it would be like in the Chancery if I were absent for the whole day. I know very well that nothing at all will happen. The Xianzhou will keep sailing on through space no matter who leaves, just as Reignbow's arrow will always shoot toward its intended target. I've been growing more and more impatient these days with trivial junk at work. Every time a new task comes in, I'll curse it alongside my colleagues both up and downstream who've been involved in it, then I'll grit my teeth and get on with the task. It's impossible to delegate to a subordinate, because young people are so carefree and only do what they want. They dream of taking a work trip out to distant planets, but do not care about the bits and pieces of work going on around them. The work we do at the Realm-Keeping Commission is meaningless. In my 122 years there, they keep repeating things over and over again in different ways, and they'll keep on repeating until the end of time. I don't want to work. I want to be just like a dog, rolling around in front of the Chancery's office as I bask in the fake sun, people-watching and dreaming up life stories for everyone. If a tourist chucked me a biscuit, I'd wag my tail at them. It's a pity that all the dogs aboard the Xianzhou are work dogs. Even Diting is far more resilient than me. November 2 People say the first signs of aging in short-life species is when we grow nostalgic for the past, and the Xianzhou natives are no different. These bodies of ours may not grow old, but our minds have long been hollowed out by all those past memories. I once dreamed that I was back on the battlefield. Wielding crossbows with my Cloud Knight brethren, this giant sword followed around behind us, searching out enemies. We went back to Xuange; went back to the Giant's Arm system; went back to the islands of Thalassa; fought all kinds of Abominations of Abundance along the way. I dreamed that I was surrounded by inhuman beasts. The sword swirled around beside me, slicing and dicing before they shatter into pieces. Fluid from the enemy corpses smeared me on the face. I didn't expect it to be not cold; I didn't expect it to be so red. The dreamscape went completely red, and huge monsters with chitinous silicone shells roared loudly, crushing all the approaching squads into a pulp. The Abominations rolled up their insect-like wings, and a chilly, painful gust blasted them straight in the face. I wanted to see what my brethren looked like again. But nobody was around me. Looking down, I saw acquiescent faces on the ground, expressions frozen as screams of wishes left unfulfilled. Every eyeball was like a scratched marble as it fell to the dust, firmly gripping the skies. Long-life species... This joke made me laugh out loud and woke me up. My right arm is burning right where it's torn off, as though I'd just been plucked from a monster's maw. Turning over my elbow, I still can't forget that pain that has made me reel at the entire world, even if my arm can grow back. Three hundred years have passed, and the pain is still yet quelled. (II). November 10 Statistics show that retired Cloud Knights are the most likely to be stricken with mara. I'm a lucky one. Having survived the Third Denizens of Abundance War unscathed, I've made it this far through life. I've even got a pension to go with my extremely low-ranking job in the Realm-Keeping Commission, whiling away time before I die. As long as I don't make a major mistake, there's no reason why this leisurely job can't keep me fed till the next Amber Era... probably. Those schmucks in the Chancery always think I'm so careless, and that I make tough work look easy. They mockingly call me Dahao the Immortal. They even have a bet running about when I'm going to get picked up by the Ten-Lords Commission. It matters not if they're long-life or short-life species. Youngsters all have no concept of things such as \"the end of life.\" I'd do anything to see the looks on these schmucks' faces when the Ten-Lords Commission's spiritfarers show up to pick them up. It's a real shame that I will definitely depart before they do. The Ten-Lords Commission... I know every Xianzhou person gets picked up by them in the end, but I've never fully understood how they do it. There's an urban legend on the Luofu about how the Ten-Lords Commission will pore over the list of the dead, take people into the netherworld, then tally up your sins and merits. Unlike normal humans, those judges belong to the other side. You shouldn't even look at them if you run into them... That's all pretty convincing, but when I think about it more carefully, there are a lot of questions: Where exactly is this netherworld on the Xianzhou? How do they know when mara is approaching you? How can they know every minor thing that had happened in your life, and then rate you like a lyceum abecedary giving good or bad grades? Ha, in the end, legends are just legends. All they're good for is tricking kids! November 12 But I've actually seen the Ten-Lords Commission's spiritfarers before. More than once, actually. The first time was back when I started as an orderly at the Realm-Keeping Commission. I saw a group of kids walking the streets of Drifters Sanctum with lanterns in hand. It was nighttime, and even the moon and starlight were removed from the delve's artificial sky. Everyone was locked safely away in their homes with not another soul about. Only those children walked in silence with lamps floating beside them, as though they were spawned straight out of the darkness itself. I knew the man walking behind them. He was my father. When Dad turned 646 years old, he suddenly started blurting out nonsense. He'd ask why I knocked over the rice bowl on the table, why I burnt his clothes, and why I kicked his jade abacus around like a soccer ball... Those were probably my unruly conduct back when I was a teenager. I couldn't remember anything about them myself. Over the next few days, he went off food and drink and stopped responding to people \u2014 just sitting there like a living corpse, like a cobweb that manifested in an abandoned corner of the house. Filled with dust. Devoid of life. I realized he was displaying signs of the five decays and was on the verge of being stricken with mara. According to the rules, I invited an Alchemy Commission healer to do an outpatient run, still wanting to see if he had any possibility of recovery. The healer prescribed a few different medications, then looked me straight in the eye and warned me to be prepared. \"Prepared for what?\" I asked the healer. The healer replied with a practiced expression, \"prepare for your father to be taken away.\" It was then I knew that Dad's time had come. I knew that everyone in Xianzhou has to face such a day sooner or later, but now that it was happening to Dad... everything just seemed so sudden. I picked up the prescription from the table and read it again and again, like a master poring over a disciple's homework. The healer suddenly reached over and grabbed a corner of the prescription, as if to take it back. I understood her tacit intent: There is no medicinal cure for being mara-struck. But I remembered gripping that prescription tightly, muttering again and again: \"Just try this medicine one more time. One more time. Just one more time.\" She pulled back her hand in the face of my stubbornness, and busied herself with preparing the remedy. As expected, Dad never said another word to me after that, until he walked up to me with those children. Perhaps it was an illusion, but he seemed younger. It is ridiculous to suggest that a Xianzhou native could grow younger. Our appearance doesn't change once we reach adulthood \u2014 but our demeanor certainly can. Dad was walking briskly with a look of liberation and freedom about him. That dusty, lifeless look on his face was gone. I opened my mouth to call for Dad, but the words got stuck in my throat. Before I could speak, he spoke softly and clearly. \"Take care of yourself.\" It felt like he had recovered, that he returned from the brink of being mara-struck... But I knew it was just my wishful thinking. Those two children blew out their lamps, and in the blink of an eye, all I could see was darkness \u2014 as though Dad and those children had never existed. I even forgot about my night shift, and just stood there alone in the darkness. A moment later, I suddenly remembered that prescription the healer had left me. I'd been keeping it in my breast pocket, but fishing around in there, I realized that it wasn't there anymore."}

Both a renowned member of the Xianzhou Alliance's High-Cloud Quintet and the High Elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara, Dan Feng was an important figure within the Alliance. Due to circumstances that led to the Quintet's dissolution, he was charged guilty of one of the Xianzhou's \"ten unpardonable sins\" and sentenced to imprisonment in the Shackling Prison, where he was forced to undergo molting rebirth and eternal banishment. History. During Dan Feng's time in the Quintet, he served as both a healer and cloudhymn sorcerer. His signature weapon was Cloud-Piercer, a weapon crafted by fellow Quintet member Yingxing. He was shown to be close with the other Quintet members, and would regularly drink and spar with them. At some point, Dan Feng allowed Yingxing into the Dragon Palace at Scalegorge Waterscape, a sacred ground for the Vidyadhara, to repay a favor. During battle, Dan Feng would seek his comrades' whereabouts and use them as grounding anchors, despite his draconic power dulling mortal empathy when in use. According to Jing Yuan, many saw Dan Feng only for his immense power, not as a person \"with feelings and emotions.\" In the Year 7379 of the Star Calendar, in an event that later came to be known as the \"Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae,\" Dan Feng caused turmoil by \"stealing\" the power of the Abundance and invoking the Transmutation Arcanum, breaking the foremost of ten unpardonable sins on the Xianzhou with the help of Yingxing. It is implied that this was in the aftermath of a devastating war against Shuhu, an Emanator of Yaoshi, where fellow Quintet member Baiheng lost her life. Their tampering with the Ambrosial Arbor caused the creation of an abhorrent beast, and for Yingxing to somehow become immortal and struck with mara. This caused Yingxing, now Blade, to harbor an immense resentment for Dan Feng, and in turn, his reincarnation. With the Transmutation Arcanum in his possession, Dan Feng was able to personally perform the ritual to name a new Vidyadhara High Elder of the Luofu, and he selected the Vidyadhara who would be reborn as Bailu. However the ritual failed, and as a result Dan Feng's power was splintered between Bailu and his next reincarnation, Dan Heng. During his imprisonment, Dan Feng was chained and tortured. He eventually went through molting rebirth, the process of Vidyadhara reincarnation, which involved the Preceptors using an exuviation charm against his will. After his rebirth, the newly born Dan Heng was held in the Shackling Prison for an indeterminate amount of time before being exiled \u2014 a lighter sentence, negotiated by Jing Yuan, than what both the Vidyadhara Preceptors and Ten-Lords Commission wanted for him. In the aftermath of the Sedition, Dan Feng became a sort of legend among Xianzhou storytellers \u2014 and even after his passing, many Vidyadhara still worshipped him in secret. There were several dramas and literary works made about the Sedition from the perspective of supporters, which caused groups to form that stood against the Alliance. It was said that the Seat of Divine Foresight originally allowed the works, and only sought to remove them after rebellious groups formed against the government."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5749","text":"Dan Shu's Diary Dan Shu's Diary is a readable series found aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. (I). Please hear me, Reignbow Arbiter. Yufei would always laugh at me for being childish and writing to you in my diary, but this has been a habit since I was a child. Besides, I also genuinely believe you are able to read this. Your eyes have always been able to see everything you want to see. Someone like me should not have been born, yet now I live a wealthy life and have friends such as Yufei by my side. I thank your blessings every second of every day. Therefore, I hope everything I've done recently would not offend your peerless authority... I bear no dissatisfaction with the world of Xianzhou that you guard and protect. I simply wish to see the real world in real colors. When I was a child in the lyceum and my peers bullied me for my lack of sight, I had always firmly believed my condition to be a trial sent by the Reignbow Arbiter to test me. I maintained that belief in my later years when I entered the academy and had to spend more effort than others to keep up with my studies. As if to reward me for my tenacity, you sent Yufei to be my friend. When we were seven years old, she chased away the malevolent classmates bullying me, and she has been my best friend ever since. Yufei protected me from the bullies and helped me to keep up with my studies. During the school holidays, she would take me to visit glamorous scenes in the various ecological delves and describe their beauty to me with great vividness. Her voice is very pleasant to listen to, like the touch of cold streams brushing past my fingertips. In theory, I shouldn't be dissatisfied with life at all. However... humans are visual creatures, and we perceive the world via lights and colors. I simply do not know what Yufei means when she says \"the dusk painted the sky red at the end of the forest like a flame.\" In fact, I don't even know what Yufei looks like. I can touch, I can imagine, and yet I still cannot construct a complete picture. Therefore, with Yufei's support, I decided to find a way to restore sight to myself. By the blessing of the Reignbow, I have become the best alchemist in the Alchemy Commission, and Yufei is its best healer. Perhaps we can indeed find a way to free the Incomplete Ones from our eternal torment. Yufei and I had tried many strategies recently, but none of them worked. Firstly, we tried to non-invasively create prosthetic eyes. In fact, this is how my ingenium arm works, which can function as well as a real arm. Theoretically, these non-intrusive methods can help Incomplete Ones with visual impairments. However, for those with visual neuron developmental issues such as I, non-intrusive methods can do little to help. Secondly, we tried to create vision using the principles behind Butterfly Immersia. At its core, Butterfly Immersia uses Foxian pheromones to create controllable illusions. We wondered whether it can therefore bypass the eye as a visual signal receptor, and directly send images to the brain. The outcomes indicated this to be a viable strategy. However, these signals failed to form meaningful images in my brain. It did allow me to \"see\" colors and shapes for the first time, but I genuinely cannot tell what is \"red\" and what is \"a circle.\" We guess this is due to how Butterfly Immersias rely on the experiencer's senses to recreate images. Therefore, when faced with sensory stimuli that I have never experienced before, even the Foxians' pheromones were helpless. How odd. It showed me so many colors, but I don't really miss that feeling. Thirdly, we tried to trigger sensory compensation using other senses. This was Yufei's idea, which was an extension of the non-invasive prosthetic eyes concept \u2014 By converting visual signals into auditory, tactile, gustatory, or olfactory signals, these other sensory organs could create a whole new concept of \"sight.\" We created a prototype gadget, but our biggest challenge was its size. All the external sensors added together are heavier than the weight of three humans combined. It was a pain to even walk while carrying them, let alone testing them. Nevertheless, we still conducted many tests. Our results indicate this tool is much better suited for short-life species. Their brains have greater plasticity, through which sensory compensation can trigger synesthesia, where one sensory organ activates a different sensory organ. If they use this tool for long periods of time, they would be able to realistically \"taste,\" \"hear,\" or \"smell\" colors, shapes, and visual distances. However, for long-life species with low neuroplasticity (such as I), these sensory organs cannot come together to create a brand-new sense. Admittedly, I now know the testing block is blue whenever I taste chili peppers; and if I smell a frosty scent after that, then I know the block is a cone in shape. But I still have not \"seen\" them, let alone know what \"blue\" means... Though short-life species will gain more from this tool, most of their bodily issues can be solved by invasive prosthetics and would have no need for something as complicated as this. These experiments cost huge amounts of time and effort for Yufei and me, yet we have produced almost no viable results. I can't even be sure whether these experiments can help other researchers in the future. I feel dejected and powerless, and I feel like I let Yufei down. I got in touch with Professor Egan from the Intelligentsia Guild. He presented a rather outlandish solution, something he called \"Eliminative Materialism Therapy.\" Eliminative Materialism is an ancient philosophical idea that states all human emotions arise from internal steroids and electrical signals. Professor Egan believes that if we cannot eliminate the root of the Incomplete Ones' suffering, then we will eliminate the suffering itself. As long as we use a pump to periodically inject specific medications into the body, we can make the person not care about their physical issues. I will have no desire to see the world, and not feel sad about my condition at all. It sounds very bizarre, but it seems to be a viable path. Unfortunately, the experimental results indicate this does not work for long-life species, either. The hormones within long-life species are strictly regulated, and any external force that influences this system would cause an overwhelming retaliation. I experienced uncaring freedom for about two hours before almost dying from a cytokine storm. I've conducted lots of experiments. There has been no progress whatsoever. I'm feeling really defeated. But I want to see what Yufei looks like, even if for just once. So I asked behind Yufei's back (she would never agree to something as ludicrous) for Professor Egan to transplant a pair of eyes for me. I saw myself and Yufei for the first time. Her short black hair shimmered with light like soft silk, and her pale skin was beautiful like the best ceramics from the Zhuming. Her ebony eyes were bloodshot with sadness and fatigue, and she kept shedding tears. She looked at my new eyes and said: \"Dan Shu, do you know what this means to you?\" I know. Of course I know. These eyes will gradually be rejected, bringing me unimaginable pain in the process. Historically, people have even become stricken with mara due to such agony. Then, I would return to the darkness and lose everything I have momentarily gained. I said to Yufei: \"Let's go see those views together, the ones you told me about.\" Ten days later, we stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing at the artificial sun gradually disappearing on the other side of the delve's false sky. The rejection reaction was getting stronger and stronger, but as long as she was beside me, it didn't seem so bad. The dusk painted the sky red at the end of the forest like a flame. That night, as I screamed in a puddle of my own blood, I once again returned to the darkness. (II). Please hear me, Reignbow Arbiter. Yufei is enlisted in the war. This is the third great war between the Alliance and the Denizens of Abundance. Many people I know went to the war, but I never imagined Yufei would be conscripted as well. \"The Alliance needs the best healer, and I happen to be the best healer. That can't be helped, right?\" Yufei held my head in her palms as she said this in pretended carelessness. I grabbed Yufei's hand and replied anxiously. \"The Luofu has so many healers. Why does it have to be you? You're not a Cloud Knight. You can refuse...\" \"I know you're worried about me.\" Yufei comforted me gently. \"I'm just a healer. I won't be in danger. Besides, the Arbiter will keep me safe.\" She had made up her mind to go. I could only beg her. \"You're an amazing person. You can live a happy life even without me. But I'm weak. I don't know how to live in a world without you. So please, please return in one piece.\" Yufei laughed haplessly. \"I can't live without you either! Trust me. I'll be back safe and sound.\" She then let go of my hand. I knelt on the ground, covered my ears, and curled up in a ball. I didn't want to listen to the sounds of her leaving. Reignbow Arbiter, please bring her back safely. Someone became mara-struck in the urban area of the Exalting Sanctum and caused quite a bit of destruction. We have been assigned by the Judges of the Ten-Lords Commission to conduct an autopsy on his corpse. The results of the autopsy were very interesting to me. I'm going to record it here for future reference. The deceased was an Incomplete One. He was born without limbs and had a congenital heart condition. However, the autopsy indicated all his disabilities seemed to have completely disappeared after he became struck with mara. His limbs became stronger than a yellow boulder calf's, and his heart was as steady as a starskiff's engine. In fact, such records are often to be found in the annals of history, but I'm still very stunned to come face-to-face with such an occurrence. I have to admit that I have been deliberately ignoring one particular cure for the Incomplete Ones... Specifically, to accept the Plagues Author's power. After all, no one had heard about there being Incomplete Ones among the borisin. Perhaps there indeed exists a way to harmlessly utilize the Plagues Author's power. Of course, this is only a fleeting fantasy. Doing such experiments would be a crime worthy of death. Just in case, these words are for any future Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission who may investigate this diary: The above content is all my fantasies, and I have no plans of executing them. Yufei and I wrote many letters to each other recently. She's safe for now at the field hospital away from the front lines. Of course, I'm worried about her, but the only thing I can do is silently pray. Reignbow Arbiter, please keep her safe. The war is over. We won, and Yufei is dead. I can't understand how she could die in the field hospital away from the fighting. I kept asking and asking like I was mad, till the Cloud Knights finally told me the truth. The Reignbow Arbiter had descended onto the physical plane and annihilated the borisins' fleet using THEIR divine arrow. At the same time, THEIR divine miracle wrought some \"collateral damage\" \u2014 such as the field hospital Yufei was based in. She did not die in the hands of the Denizens of Abundance. Instead, she was ground to dust by the Reignbow Arbiter's divine arrow, with not even a single bone of her left behind. Why, Reignbow Arbiter? Reignbow Arbiter, this will be the last time I write to you. I wish all that you hope to destroy are resurrected. I wish all that you hope to preserve is annihilated. I wish all lives in the land will thrive contrary to your desires. I wish all stars in the sky will be dimmed because of your existence. I wish this cosmos to be full of life, and not full of death. I wish the Alliance will exist forever, but not in the way you desired."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34314","text":"Data Bank\/Aeons Introduction. People know very little about the mysterious existence that dwells in the vast stellar seas. With the limitation of knowledge, intelligent lifeforms can only faintly discern that Aeons tread upon paths imperceptible to mortal beings and execute unfathomable powers via some form of belief. In the end, the Aeons became an embodiment of highly condensed concepts of philosophy through the word of mouth spread of their legends. If anyone finds themselves treading on the Path of an Aeon, they will be inundated by a distant sensation, like being struck by a gaze from light-years across the cosmos. Many believe that this is the only connection the Aeons and mortals can ever have. Akivili the Trailblaze. There are three directions on the compass of destiny \u2014 the Unknown, the Known, and the Unknowable. THEY can tolerate the Unknown, but will never bow to the Unknowable.Akivili left the isolated world of Pegana and continued to expand the unknown edges of the universe, trying to find an endpoint of the Tree of Existence. Unfortunately, Akivili's destiny was abruptly ended due to an accident. Nanook the Destruction. The birth of the universe is a mistake. If civilization is a cancer emerging quietly from the boundless stars, then war is the only common language known to all intelligent life.To correct this mistake and to clean up this tainted universe, Nanook became the avatar of entropy. Lan the Hunt. The Aeon known as the Reignbow Arbiter wanders endlessly between worlds to destroy the undead beings that once poisoned their homeworld.The cost of the hunt was never a consideration for Lan. There is often no difference between the salvation they offer and total destruction. Nous the Erudition. All things bear unanswered questions, and there is an answer to everything.The astral computer originally meant to provide answers to the universe ascended to Aeonhood.Nous hopes to understand the universe and solve all of its mysteries. Xipe the Harmony. A plural Aeon from multiple harmonious worlds. The glorious Xipe of thousand faces is chanting songs of joy and happiness.To battle the brutality of the laws of the universe, intelligent lifeforms must discard their cowardly selfishness and the differences between individuals, fusing into one singular melody \u2014 to have the strong help the weak, and to protect life with death. IX the Nihility. The existence of Nihility is a mystery itself, THEIR form enshrouded by layers of mist.IX doesn't interact with the other Aeons. THEY believe that the ultimate fate of the multiverse is nothingness, and therefore, worthless. Qlipoth the Preservation. The builder of the Celestial Comet Wall, the Subspace Crystalline Barrier, and the Great Attractor Base. Followers call THEM the \"Amber Lord,\" one of the oldest and most tenacious Aeons, having survived the \"Dusk Wars.\"Aware of the imminence of THEIR mortal enemy's devouring, the Amber Lord forged a powerful light-years-long seal that would isolate and protect the living worlds. Yaoshi the Abundance. Ask with sentiment, and you shall receive.Yaoshi is the nurturer of the people, the god of peace. THEIR presence ensures the existence of life.Yaoshi is an Aeon who answers all prayers and cannot bear to see death and the pains of illness. Oroboros the Voracity. The drinker of worlds, the unsatisfied devourer, the black hole with thought. THEY are an Aeon and a Leviathan at the same time.In the eyes of Oroboros, life is a flickering fragment floating in the sea of void, destined to return to the darkness along with the stars which birthed THEM \u2014 This darkness is within the depths of THEIR mouths. Aha the Elation. The elated one understands that only the wise and sentient possess the privilege of understanding joy. Neither the dusty rocks nor the distant stars can fathom the humor that life entails.A quest for formidable adversaries in games of strategy and activities to while away the time bears no winners or losers.Instead, a search for the kind of laughter that leaves one breathless, will lead to the unexpected delights that uplift the soul toward divinity. Fuli the Remembrance. The purest memory in existence is the most tolerant: It records everything without disgust or preference. It selflessly preserves every fact and every enchanting gesture. It is a river formed from continuous life, a treasure built up out of eternal wisdom.\u2014 Fuli is the fish that swims back upstream. Fuli is the key to this treasure vault. THEY sit in the center of the sanctuary, silently watching as the world tirelessly repeat the same mistakes over and again. Idrila the Beauty. Idrila witnessed the ultimate meaning of the world's existence through the ever-changing view of the universe, known to the rest as the concept of \"beauty.\"The Aeon of Beauty suddenly vanished one day. It was just as mysterious as when THEY first appeared. Tayzzyronth the Propagation. Tayzzyronth, also known as the Imperator Insectorum, the Sand King, and the creator of the Swarm Disaster.As the last member of the Coleoptera that rules the land, THEIR Path was ignited out of a desire born from loneliness. Tayzzyronth metamorphosed into a self-duplicating horror, a torrent of infinite propagation. Tayzzyronth \u2014 Tayzzyronths rather \u2014 fluttered across the worlds until THEIR advances were halted by fate in some way. Mythus the Enigmata. It is a fallacy that all things can be experienced and recognized. The living seek to produce prophecies of the unknown based on their limited grasp of order, but little do they know that the universe has no end and that the truth is but a fevered dream. To prevent the certainty that Erudition brought about from destroying the possibilities championed by Mythus, Mythus conjured the Fog of Thought and the Rain of Sensation to reveal to the mortals the inexplicable truth through the four agents: Morph, Screen, Riddle, and Mirage. HooH the Equilibrium. The chain of karma that mortals obsess over is nothing but a rough approximation of the complicated topology behind all things \u2014 HooH dissolved THEIR will into the web of logic behind the universe's movement, maintaining the balance and stability of all things in perpetuity.Adventurous mortals tirelessly seek out flaws in this system, believing their intellect to be superior to that of the Aeon. However, little could they imagine that they have already been reduced to strings inside a surveillance system, unable to escape the meticulous network woven by HooH."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34305","text":"Data Bank\/Factions Factions. The mortal beings' speculation of divine intent is a futile endeavor, akin to the irrelevance of a mayfly against the enormity of the cosmos. However, when individuals harbor a shared misconception, they gather as a crowd, giving rise to an added value: the formation of consensus, the transmutation of misconception into a generally accepted solution, and the attraction of the collective... Subsequently, factions naturally emerge. Regardless of the size of factions, they all believe that their faith bears the will of the Aeons. Countless factions even claim to be the emissaries of a certain Aeon. Most of the Aeons have found no interest in the ways of these factions. Some, however, find it extremely amusing to watch these ants in their fervent labor. THEY may provide careful guidance, or create mysticism to alter the progress of the faction. This is THEIR way of influencing the world. Though most of the Aeons remain distant, the vast number of factions have made the stars a lively place. They carry banners and flags, forming allies and foes, fighting those who stand against their beliefs. The cosmos became a lively place indeed. Astral Express \u2014 Trailblaze. After the fall of Akivili, the Aeon of Trailblaze, THEIR trailblazing will was inherited by THEIR followers, the Nameless, including the Astral Express that the Aeon once rode on. However, as the Cancer of All Worlds continues to spread, the star rails that the Express runs on also fell victim. The Express could barely run before the blight descended, and had no choice but to run around when the rails became overly obstructed. It remained so for many years until a girl with red hair discovered the desolate Express. She was fascinated by the wordless stories the engine and the star rails had in store. She spent countless hours repairing the cracks and evening the dents, restoring the Express to its original form. The curious girl then set foot into the Express and began her trailblazing voyage that surveys the cosmos. The Astral Express made stops at every station, with passengers boarding and exiting along the way. Many join and leave the Express' journey. The travelers come from different worlds, shoulder different burdens, and head to different destinations. However, while they are on the Astral Express, they would share the same voyage. That is why Himeko and the Express do not hesitate to open the doors to anyone willing to share this magical experience, regardless of their agendas and intentions. Stellaron Hunter \u2014 ??? In a quiet moment in time, the Cancer of All Worlds began to cause ripples across the stars, like a rock tossed into a pool of water. Before anyone noticed, this twisted and unknown matter had already corrupted a great number of worlds, but resplendent and mesmerizing gems accompanied this corrosive mud \u2014 gems known as the Stellarons. Death and despair followed wherever Stellarons went. For many civilizations who have experienced the disasters it brings, Stellarons are symbols of destruction. However, despite the Stellarons' nature, there emerged the fearless few who travel between worlds to obtain Stellarons. They call themselves the Stellaron Hunters. No one knows anything about the Stellaron Hunters aside from what they have done. Which Aeon do they worship? What do they want with the Stellaron? With the cosmos filled with rumors about them, only one thing is for certain: Though the Stellaron Hunters are few in numbers, each of them holds incredible capacities and powers. The Nameless \u2014 Trailblaze. A thousand years ago, the Aeon Akivili traversed across worlds, laying down the silver rail that linked worlds together in the sea of stars, and leaving behind countless legends about the universe and exploration. The brave and curious were attracted by the tales of these adventures and followed the steps of the Trailblaze, joining the god on their journeys to explore the cosmos. The adventurers called themselves the Nameless. They rode the Express created by Akivili, and set off on thrilling adventures on planets connected by the star rail. Legend has it that Akivili the Trailblaze loved journeying with mortals. THEY and the Nameless would share wine from various worlds and sing songs composed by diverse civilizations. They would disguise the moving Express as the trail of a shooting star and laugh at the people looking up in awe. However, they would often get into deep trouble due to their recklessness, only to be saved by the Aeon's power. Akivili formed a deep bond with THEIR followers, and their adventures continued to attract travelers to join the ranks of the Nameless. When Akivili fell, a group of loyal Nameless carried on what the Aeon had started, continuing the exploration of the unknown. They held the belief that one day the will of Trailblaze will connect the entire universe. The Astral Express that once carried Akivili and THEIR followers still hurries between the stars till this day. It is believed that the Express is powered by the heart of the deceased Aeon, and is repairing with great difficulty the star rail contaminated by the unknown cancer. Xianzhou Alliance \u2014 The Hunt. In an ancient era of legends, multiple Xianzhou ships were tasked with voyaging across the stars to search for the miracle medicine of immortality. The endless voyage took its toll on Xianzhou, wearing away its conviction and shape over the long years, until their eventual encounter with Yaoshi. However, all that the fruit of immortality brought upon them were sorrows, poverty, and endless war and death. It wasn't until Lan, the Aeon of The Hunt, returned from the Abyss. Using gravity as bowstring and stars as arrows, Lan shattered the Ambrosial Arbor and put the wickedness of Abundance to an end. After Xianzhou returned to the righteous path, it formed an alliance under the guidance of The Hunt and formed a powerful army known as the Cloud Knights. The alliance's goals were to patrol the world and eradicate all Abominations of Abundance, and put an end to the corruption of the undead. Over the years, the Xianzhou Alliance landed on a great number of worlds that used to enjoy the grace of gods. They eradicated countless undead abominations. Any civilization that worshiped Abundance had to consider the possible threat of the Xianzhou destroying their planet. This kind of deterrence was precisely what the Xianzhou Alliance is hoping to be. They want to be seen as the constant red line for those greedy for immortality, becoming the price that none dares to pay. To this day, countless souls have gathered upon Xianzhou, all bearing the will of The Hunt and the intent of seeking revenge on the ravaging Abundance. They will not rest until the complete eradication of the Deathless Doom, and their cosmic tours will not end. Galaxy Rangers \u2014 The Hunt. Not all devotees of The Hunt hate Abundance. Such a group of talented rangers exists out there. This group admires Lan's policy of using violence against violence and the Aeon's swift decisiveness regarding punishment, believing the benevolence and justice of the universe need to be upheld via personal action. The Galaxy Rangers formed into a group of heroes, walking the Path of The Hunt, and roam the universe thanks to the blessings of the Aeon. They went from planet to planet upholding justice for the locals, hunting down evil, then embarking on new journeys. The successful assassination of a Lord Ravager, Zulo, first brought the Galaxy Rangers their fame. And many years later, a Ranger thwarted the atavistic experiment of the 64th member of the Genius Society, Dr. Primitive. But after that, these Galaxy Rangers gradually faded out of sight in the cosmos. Rumor has it that they fell victim to Dr. Primitive's vengeance. Doctors of Chaos \u2014 Nihility. &lt;section begin=\"nihility-faction-intro\" \/&gt; \"Existence is nothing.\" When an organism has this thought and applies it as a guiding principle, it begins to walk on the Path ruled by IX and receive the meaningless glimpse of the Aeon from some distant void. This will usually have two outcomes: 1) The organism will devolve and truly become nothing, becoming something called a Self-Annihilator. 2) The organism will be captivated by the magnificence of the Aeon, thus becoming a Doctor of Chaos in their spontaneous curiosity.&lt;section end=\"nihility-faction-intro\" \/&gt; Doctors of Chaos uphold a creed of saving the world: If they are able to prove to IX that existence is more than nothing, they could free that large and lonely soul from the depths of the void. What they try to prove is a paradox, and it cannot be done by mortals, yet the Doctors of Chaos seem to enjoy trying \u2014 Because the moment they perceived the worthlessness of life, that glance from the distant cosmos inspired within them a futile desire to revolt against meaningless destiny. Device IX \u2014 Nihility. Everything in the universe is bound by the prison of Existence, constrained by their body and mind and blinded by the world's superficial appearance. Even the most intelligent beings cannot comprehend this. Matter, order, logic, and life... Everything that makes up \"reality\" is but one side of the coin. On the opposite side, of equal entropy, there exists \"nihility.\" The two balance each other to create the complete universe. Legend has it that a mysterious faction known as Device IX lurks in the empty reflections of void, difficult to be perceived by the material world. Those who gaze into the void for a long time will gradually be drawn to the dark energy overflowing in the abyss, eventually passing through the Dark Web that separates reality from nothingness \u2014 This legend has yet to be proven, though. The most prestigious geniuses in the universe attempted to solve this mystery, challenging Device IX with no results. Why was this organization created? What are its goals? How many members does it have and what do they do? Does... Device IX truly exist? The answer is as empty as the question itself. Denizens of Abundance \u2014 Abundance. The Denizens of Abundance create poetry and art in the name of their beloved god, spreading the love and kindness of Yaoshi throughout the universe. In the worlds blessed by Yaoshi, the water never runs dry and creatures are free from the cruel binds of time. Life is free to bloom as it sees fit. In the worlds blessed by Yaoshi, age is but a number, and mortals are not afraid of aging and death. They enjoy their lives to the fullest. Though its denizens come from different worlds, they all tell the same story: Thousands of years ago, war ravaged their lands. The short lives of mortals bred greed and fear, which gave rise to plunder and tyranny. As demons and plagues ran rampant, the very fate of this world and its denizens were at stake in the flames of war... until a kind god descended and planted a flower seed as warm as the sunshine. The moment the seed touched the earth, the whole world was transformed. Parched soil began to heal and muddy waters became clear. Mortals tortured by wounds and disease were no longer in pain. People's hearts were no longer filled by sorrow. Humankind discarded their blood-stained weapons and began spontaneously praising the blessings from the god of Abundance... Yaoshi ended the suffering of these worlds and bestowed upon mortals body and soul that could withstand the corrosion of time. In return, the Denizens of Abundance made Yaoshi's name known to the universe to show their gratitude. Rumors started to spread that certain hunters who roam between worlds regard Yaoshi as evil and THEIR creation defiled creatures. The Denizens will not tolerate such blatant blasphemy. The heathens must pay. Elixir Seekers \u2014 Abundance. Conflict and turmoil linger everywhere in an already short life span. The lust and ambitions of the living continuously spark conflict and disaster. The transience of life has driven many ordinary people into madness. In order to escape the pain and burden that mortality has brought upon civilization, worlds upon worlds have sent out faithful emissaries of Abundance in hopes of finding the famous Yaoshi and acquiring the elixir of immortality. These Elixir Seekers all come from different backgrounds. Some are royals with the command of an entire fleet, while some are just lonely travelers who have nothing but themselves. What they do have in common, however, is the obsession over immortality. The Xianzhou Alliance has repeatedly warned blind followers that there is a cost that lies behind the blessings of Abundance. However, their warnings have always fallen on deaf ears. Arrogance and fear have always trumped the voice of reason, pushing Elixir Seekers further on their fruitless voyage. Among the vast number of Elixir Seekers, how many have seen the face of the Abundance? How many can succeed in returning to their civilization with the supposed medicine of salvation? Sadly, these immortality-seeking voyagers have chosen to ignore the harrowing wails of the long-lived monsters that have terrorized the universe. Antimatter Legion \u2014 Destruction. Nanook, the Aeon of Destruction, commands a vast legion that brings chaos and destruction to the worlds. Loyal followers of Nanook swear to embark on the Path of Destruction, placing themselves at the absolute opposite of life and civilization. They are known as the Antimatter Legion that spreads terror throughout the universe. The fiercest races of the universe act as vanguards for the Legion. There are also evil strategists who plot out the destruction of worlds and act as the brains of the Legion. Innocent new worlds are ruthlessly destroyed, while proud and mature civilizations are forced to learn humility while on the brink of collapse. The will of Destruction will only slow down when faced with a dying world. The Legion saunters over planets on the verge of being shattered, devouring the chaotic energy emitted by the process of decay. Only when the last flame of civilization has been extinguished will they leave contently to search for their next target. Worlds swept by the tide of the legion ask helplessly in their dying moments, \"why?\" Amidst the victims' cries of despair, the countless evils in the Legion sneer so heinously that even the stars shudder. It is said that, as demons and evils roam, sometimes the shadow of Nanook would emerge from the starry sky to witness the tragic end of another world. Annihilation Gang \u2014 Destruction. Not all fanatical devotees of the Path of Destruction are welcomed into the Antimatter Legion. There are many murderous species throughout the cosmos obsessed with pillaging and annihilation, but they lack the ability to systematically pursue the will of Destruction. The scumbags of the Annihilation Gang fantasize about one day serving as pioneers of Destruction, but they have no idea that their cruelty only incurs Nanook's utter contempt for them. The reason is that the Annihilation Gang's goal behind their thirst for destruction is not pure enough. Chaotic desires are also mixed therein, with some taking pleasure in bloody slaughter, some plundering as an excuse for filthy vengeance, and some relying on endless destruction to calm their internal madness. They claim to be loyal followers of Destruction, but never escape the enslavement of their own selfish desires. These marauders roam the stars, dragging everything they touch into a vortex of havoc. They will not abandon their feeble personal ideals, and so must endure the tortures of eternal spiritual exile. The Family \u2014 Harmony. In the vision of the Harmony, the diverse civilizations throughout the universe will eventually become as close as siblings, singing in unison the hymn of unity and joy. The universe will become a harmonious whole, with no discordant notes to disrupt the beautiful chords and no fools worrying about their own short-sighted futures. Thus, under the loving radiance of the Aeon Xipe, THEIR chosen people formed a harmonious \"Family.\" They come from different worlds, belong to different civilizations, and have different identities, but they are, at the same time, the closest family members there are. There is never noisy disputes or even contradictions among its members, only eternal love and smiles \u2014 there is no more harmonious family in the universe than them. The Family calls out to other worlds with their song, encouraging them to embrace Harmony. Whenever new worlds accept the blessing of Xipe, The Family will celebrate, rejoice, and work even harder at praising the Aeon's kindness. But not every blessed world can become a member of The Family. Few would mention the civilizations that perished out of stupidity or hubris. People are also curious whether any members of The Family had grown tired of the one and voluntarily abandoned the Path of Harmony? In the face of such a question, The Family smiles and replies \"Never.\" Genius Society \u2014 Erudition. Nous stays in a corner of the cosmos, working out the equations of the universe made up of trillions of variables and deriving the unknown laws of imaginary numbers. Once in a while, a spark of intelligence flashes in a mortal world. The Aeon of Erudition sends a signal to its source, inviting geniuses to join in the search for answers to the universe. Many people misinterpret the signal, thinking the invitation to the Genius Society merely represents the favor and approval of the Aeon. Then, they proudly continue to devote themselves to their studies, unaware that the solution to the problems that they have spent their whole lives searching for had already been solved by Nous thousands of years ago. There are also those who rejoice, thinking they have already reached greatness and had created priceless asset of civilization with their diligence and wisdom. They were sure that their life's achievements deserve Nous's approval. These geniuses were eager for a response from Nous, but the Erudition has no time to appreciate the insignificant achievements of mere mortals. THEIR silence was deafening. Only very few can ascertain Nous's intentions. They humbly ask questions and seek guidance from the Erudition. These enlightened few then disappear from the world, only leaving behind their world-shattering answers. \"The answer to the universe is beyond the limits of mortal wisdom.\" \u2014 Only geniuses who can clearly acknowledge this conclusion can break free from the shackles of worldly curiosity, becoming true members of the Genius Society. Intelligentsia Guild \u2014 Erudition. Only the cream of the crop can become members of the Genius Society, but the Intelligentsia Guild wastes not. The Guild is willing to accept all beings from the infinite universe who seek to learn, as well as providing all that is needed for the full pursuit of knowledge. The Intelligentsia Guild advocates that \"all knowledge must be circulated like currency.\" Therefore, although there are different schools that specialize in different subjects within the Guild, everyone is actively engaged with one another with no isolationism. Members trade knowledge for wisdom and formulas for recipes, seeking to achieve mastery. Each school, like a business, pays for itself, and academic circulation has achieved the maximum efficiency proposed in economic models. An elder in the Genius Society thought the Intelligentsia Guild as laughing stock. However, as an open academic organization, the Intelligentsia Guild was above such mockery. After a long period of research and exploration, its members have reached a consensus that \"the only way to transcend the limitations of the individual is to have an academic network of mutual learning.\" The Architects \u2014 Preservation. Legend has it, the Aeon of Preservation, Qlipoth, is the oldest Aeon. Silent and mighty, Qlipoth built a light-years long barrier around the cosmos, never engaging in any trivial conflicts or badgering with the other Aeons. Civilizations across the cosmos speculate on the motive of Qlipoth. One said the ancient Aeon foresaw a disaster that could obliterate the cosmos, so Qlipoth built a barrier to protect the worlds; one said Qlipoth was willing to slave for other Aeons and was ordered to build walls for THEM. There is no way to verify the truth, but Qlipoth's tireless actions moved the mortals. They spontaneously gathered in groups to build a barrier to protect their planet. Some Architects have claimed to feel the protective gaze of the Aeon upon them. They liken it to a gaze of approval, tinged with the warmth of the forge and the smell of lime. The annihilation of a single star can devastate planets thousands of light-years away, pushing them to the precipice of extinction. On the rare occasions of such calamities, worlds are saved only by the walls their denizens have built. People who survived their demise no longer mocked the stubbornness of the Architects. Instead, they joined them, never to question their motives or the meaning of Preservation ever again. Interastral Peace Corporation \u2014 Preservation. To outsiders, the IPC is an enormous consortium advocating free trade. From a business perspective, the IPC is a business that issues money and monopolizes resources. From a startup perspective, the IPC is a selfless support group dedicated to the Aeon of Preservation. When many astral citizens talk about the IPC, they talk about its ubiquitous merchandise and logo. It's as if \"The IPC exists whenever there is a transaction.\" In fact, almost all business transactions in the cosmos are based on the credit system created by the IPC. If one were to compare interastral trade to a sports competition, the IPC would be the top athletes as well as the sports, the venue, and the rules themselves. Its absolute dominance over wealth and relentless expansion has given the IPC the image of a conspiratorial business dictatorship. But the IPC pays little attention to lowly ambitions such as dictatorship, because its spirit hasn't wavered since its creation: Give everything to the Amber Lord, Qlipoth. Today, the Interastral Peace Corporation is divided into seven major departments. Perhaps the word \"department\" can no longer encompass the astounding scale of this pan-galactic enterprise. In actuality, every IPC department would often control dozens or even hundreds of civilized worlds of various scales and have billions of workers employed in a hereditary manner, let alone the countless masses that are affected by the impact of its commercial activities. These seven major departments are: The Marketing Development Department &lt;section begin=\"The Marketing Development Department\" \/&gt; The Marketing Development Department is engrossed in reaching more star systems to preach the calling of Qlipoth. At it same time, it is also responsible for pulling newly emerging worlds into the universal commercial sphere. It is said that its chairman, Oswaldo Schneider, is a former Nameless who still holds strongly to the will of Trailblaze after joining the IPC. People believe he will soon become a member of the Board of Trustees. All he's missing is some experience and an empty spot. &lt;section end=\"The Marketing Development Department\" \/&gt; The Business Consolidation Department &lt;section begin=\"The Business Consolidation Department\" \/&gt; When the Marketing Development Department finishes establishing relationships with a new world, the subsequent commercial dealings will be handed over to the Business Consolidation Department. This department is responsible for managing the IPC's Hyper-distant Delivery system. They stock take specialty goods, set prices, and continuously maintain the IPC's subsidiary facilities and goods inventory. The Business Consolidation Department is the IPC's biggest department. Its staff numbers amount to 45% of the headquarter's total personnel. &lt;section end=\"The Business Consolidation Department\" \/&gt; The Strategic Investment Department &lt;section begin=\"The Strategic Investment Department\" \/&gt; The Strategic Investment Department has the second-best foresight in the IPC. Their investment will never be limited to short-term returns. The Strategic Investment Department has an elite team of Non-Performing Asset Liquidation Specialists \u2014 the \"Ten Stonehearts\" \u2014 led by the mysterious director Diamond. These individuals traverse the universe, actively liquidating the bad debts caused by the Cancer of All Worlds. &lt;section end=\"The Strategic Investment Department\" \/&gt; The Building Material Logistics Department &lt;section begin=\"The Building Material Logistics Department\" \/&gt; The Building Material Logistics Department is the oldest in the IPC. Its former name was \"The Amber Lord's Support Team\" and was restructured after Louis rose to prominence. The current director of the department is the rotund fellow Taravan Keane \u2014 One of the rare verified Emanators of Preservation in the IPC, and one of the seven members of the Board of Trustees. He shoulders the holy duty of shipping building materials to Qlipoth, and his grip on power only solidifies over time. &lt;section end=\"The Building Material Logistics Department\" \/&gt; The Technology Department &lt;section begin=\"The Technology Department\" \/&gt; The Technology Department conducts thorough collaborations with the Intelligentsia Guild and turns the Guild's scientific results into commercial projects. Preferring the management practice by peer experts, the IPC acknowledges Director Yabuli's scientific aptitude and commercial instincts. The associations between this young lady and the Council of Mundanites in the Intelligentsia Guild are often also inspires waves of speculation. &lt;section end=\"The Technology Department\" \/&gt; The Talent Motivation Department &lt;section begin=\"The Talent Motivation Department\" \/&gt; The Talent Motivation Department is responsible for recruiting, training, and transporting talented employees for the IPC. This department is also the medium through which many intergalactic projects communicate and collaborate with their respective stakeholders. Moreover, the two directors of the Talent Motivation Department \u2014 Mtooyin Raj Zazzad and Yan Shiluo \u2014 collectively control an information network that covers the entire cosmos. Their emissaries shuttle across the cosmos, befriending the major powers, and forming alliances and relationships with talents who are not yet willing to join the IPC \u2014 These \"external aides\" will demonstrate significant value in situations where the IPC is unable or unwilling to show its face. &lt;section end=\"The Talent Motivation Department\" \/&gt; The Traditional Project Department &lt;section begin=\"The Traditional Project Department\" \/&gt; The passage of time saw the rise of fall of many industries, with their influence and positions in the IPC's trade system also ebbing and flowing. When one industry's trade falls below a certain percentage threshold in pan-galactic commerce, it will be removed from the duties of the Business Consolidation Department and handed over to director Arita of the Traditional Project Department. With its mediocre performance, the Traditional Project Department is hardly appreciated in the IPC. However, there is also the view that the true elites are concentrated in this department, where they silently conduct businesses that have withstood the test of time. &lt;section end=\"The Traditional Project Department\" \/&gt; The Swarm \u2014 Propagation. Life is born of an instinctive desire to reproduce, and the senses and spirit are only unintended byproducts created when carrying out the basic instinct of reproduction. Those who don't submit to their primal desire claim to be wise, unaware that they are already considered food for the offspring of Tayzzyronth, the Aeon of Propagation, the Father of the Swarm. The multitudes of the Swarm King's offspring can cover the starry night, their antenna long enough to measure the cosmos. Worlds fearfully call the self-replicated chaos as \u2014 The Swarm. Spirit, soul, technology, philosophy... In the thousand compound eyes of Tayzzyronth, the universal laws pursued by all intelligent races are but a side effect of the ultimate goal of reproduction. The Swarm doesn't seek a following by higher races, for \"worship\" itself is an unnecessary desire. Only the flying creatures that succumb to the primal instinct will be attracted to the self-replicating primordial tide, transforming to be part of the Swarm after becoming its food. Even without their god, the Swarm continues expanding at an incalculable rate, bringing fear and disaster to worlds chosen as their nests. Garden of Recollection \u2014 Remembrance. To think is to exist, and memories are proofs of that. All things that make up the material world will eventually perish, but they can live on in another way \u2014 through Remembrance. Contrary to popular belief that memory is mixed with the imaginary, Memokeepers from the Garden of Recollection believe reality and imagination to be a myth. What is absolutely real and immortal in the universe that is constantly reincarnating? Even stars die and black holes evaporate. On a cosmic scale, they vanish in a breath. In this flood of time and life, the only treasure is the memory that proves the existence of people. Memokeepers from the Garden of Recollection are dedicated to preserving and sharing memories. Enlightened by their master Fuli, Memokeepers shed their mortal flesh and live on as memetic entities. With this unique gift, they can freely traverse between worlds, unconstrained by physical limits. Memokeepers often disguise themselves as natives of the worlds they visit. They trade, copy, steal, deceive... using every means necessary to collect precious memories. The Cremators \u2014 Remembrance. In the Garden of Recollection where memories of the universe are sought and kept, hides a group of extreme Memokeepers who view the marks of existence differently. Instead of treasuring all that has taken place like their colleagues, they believe that there are different qualities and priorities of memories in the world, and that the pure land created by Fuli should not be taken up by worthless memories. The Cremators believe that they bear the sacred duty of filtering memories for the Aeons. They steal the stored memories that Memokeepers have gathered and rank them in order of importance. The ones that they deem worthy are returned to the collection, whereas the ones arbitrarily deemed unworthy are completely destroyed, never to be found again. The Cremators claim that they are cleaning out the garbage, all in hopes of relieving some of Fuli's burdens, and contributing to the glorious sacred grounds of Remembrance. However, the Garden of Recollection scoffed and saw no reason for their actions, for the smallest shard of memory in the universe holds just as great of importance as the grandest of feats. No mortal has the right to judge the value of any piece of memory. Mourning Actors \u2014 Elation. Mourning Actors are firm believers against Elation. They believe life is full of ups and downs, that agony makes people mature but fleeting joy only offers hopeless and unreachable temptation. Cheap entertainment is a narcotic for humans to lose themselves in. All beings should renounce joy and endure grief to temper their spirits. To this end, these people formed a theater troupe of sorrow. The Actors ride a gondola that spans the stars to perform. They collect and wear masks from different worlds, symbolizing the races that have passed and those that have not. At the same time, they record the sorrows of intelligent life. They compose magnificent tragedies for heroes facing their end, and sing graceful elegies for dying stars. Mourning Actors advocate celibacy and penance, hoping this would go against the Path of Elation and dilute the sweet allure that the Elation has been able to provide to the universe. However, joy and sadness are two sides of the same coin. Their very essence is engraved into the souls of all beings. The Aeon of Elation sees the potential strength in the beauty of tragedy. Perhaps out of fondness for their wicked sense of humor, Aha blessed these people with Aeonic powers, playfully helping them spread their renunciation of joy across many star systems. Masked Fools \u2014 Elation. The Masked Fools tell a parable of the birth of their beloved Aeon. When the Aeon of Elation climbed to the highest branch on the Tree of Existence, THEY saw the cold and despicable void, the stars operating like machinery, and how the meaning of all things bows before nothingness. THEY continued looking until THEY saw a baby fall to the ground and cry because it had been wronged. The Aeon burst into laughter, laughter so clear it tore through the cold universe and still reverberates through the universe today. The Fools believe that the truth of the world is a joke, and that the ultimate meaning of all things lies in mere laughter. The universe is merciless, but there is joy to eliminate pain, dilute sorrow, resist nihilism, and heal wounds. Laughter, the gift of intelligent races, is the only answer. Masked Fools are extremely radical when it comes to their beliefs among the followers of Elation. In their pursuit of pleasure, they do whatever it takes to find it, often causing havoc wherever they go. They laugh at heroes for self-righteousness, kings for their lust of power, lovers for their infatuation, and scholars for their overthinking. The Fools' objective is to stir the stagnant pool of life to create surges and change, because change is a source of mockery and amusement to the Fools. It would be a welcome sight if someone could turn the tables on them. Mirror Holders \u2014 Beauty. The legend of the Mirror Holders had it that the downfall of the God of Beauty was an ancient metaphor symbolizing the shattering of peoples' views on beauty, crumbling like a collapsed tower into rubble and bricks. Therefore, the goal of the Mirror Holders takes on another significance: when conceptions of beauty are reunified, all disputes and strife will disappear. They believe the Aeon they worship will be perfect and complete again, and the universe will become whole. This may not be a mere delusion, as the Mirror Holders possess a series of items named Mirrors of Transcendence. These mirrors do not reflect the material world, but instead reflect what is considered by the beholder as \"beauty\" and project that into reality. As the Mirror Holders recounted themselves, these mirrors were fragments of Idrila's divine form. When the God of Beauty died, THEIR fragments were scattered to the cosmos. The wandering Mirror Holders tried their best to find clues and recapture these fragments, hoping to one day piece everything back together and let Beauty return to the world. The Knights of Beauty \u2014 Beauty. Among the legions of Idrila's followers, the most infatuated with classical beauty formed the Knights of Beauty. They ride their faithful and dexterous mounts and chant ancient beautiful songs, as they fearlessly travel from planet to planet, extolling the name of Idrila to the beings of the universe. The Knights of Beauty are extremely self-disciplined. They stubbornly abide by an obsolete creed known as the Code of Chivalry, believing that only through a perfectly refined body, mind, and spirit can they become truly worthy of worshipping Idrila. Despite their extraordinary strength, the major factions of the cosmos hold the Knights of Beauty in low regard: Warriors with only worship but little faith are but wastrels traversing the universe, and cannot form a powerful force. Rumor has it that the Knights of Beauty do not believe in the fall of Idrila. They shuttle back and forth across the universe, their source of power still a mystery. History Fictionologists \u2014 Enigmata. There is evidence that History Fictionologists are a group of Emanators that were enlightened by Aeons. They often plunge into the sea of stars alone, traveling planet to planet with the sole purpose of fabricating, obscuring, destroying, and erasing the local history. History Fictionologists believe that the past determines the future \u2014 when a civilization's history is definite, its future development is doomed as all possibilities are eliminated, leaving only a sad and rigid path forward. In order to save these worlds from the sad fate of objectivity, History Fictionologists consider Enigmata as their only creed and are determined to shroud the universe in mystery. History Fictionologists carry out their mission of destroying history alone and decisively, with an altruism that is difficult to comprehend. Their views are poorly understood by most, and their blatant hatred of objective facts is somewhat extreme. Many worlds are beginning to realize the irreversible, intangible damage that these Emanators of Enigmata have caused to culture. Across the cosmos, History Fictionologists have a reputation comparable to that of the Antimatter Legion. The Intelligentsia Guild has publicly denounced them: The Antimatter Legion destroys matter, but the History Fictionologists destroy the very universe itself. \"[Record stamp] In view of the fact that this entry has been edited with unknown attribution, it is hereby declared that this entry is inapplicable to any reference, and will no longer be updated.\" The Riddlers \u2014 Enigmata. Enigmata has a large number of followers, with The Riddlers being a prominent group. They were once palace hall poets, chiaroscuro painters, masters of disguise, or occult monks. While having reached great heights in their respective fields, after coming into contact with the Aeons, they turned into an incomprehensible group of people who spouted ridiculousness and wrote falsehoods. Where the History Fictionologists are devoted to the mystification of history, the Riddlers are obsessed with destroying the certainty of language. Words used to express meaning are gradually obfuscated in the mouths of the Riddlers. They deconstruct texts, abuse metaphors, change word orders, tamper with semantics, and transform an otherwise precise language into something beyond recognition. While the Riddlers are not as prominent as History Fictionologists, their actions still have a subtle yet huge impact on the current universe. Why is it so hard to find a pure and precise language in the cosmos these days? That is another riddle left by the Riddlers. Self-Annihilator \u2014 Nihility. Everything in the universe is meaningless, and human beings are worthless in the eyes of Aeons. If Aeons are truly above all beings, why would THEY even care about the emotions of mortals? The Self-Annihilators are individuals who have inadvertently stepped into the shadow of IX the Nihility and from that moment have lost the meaning of their own existence. The shadow of Nihility covers the stars equally, and Self-Annihilators may form in any world. If we call them phenomena, these poor souls do share one thing in common: Their various existential properties \u2014 such as corporeal body, mental cognition, and personal memories... will gradually fade away in their journey of self-annihilation. These phenomena can hardly be explained by the laws of nature. As described in the handwritten notes of the Doctors of Chaos \u2014 Some Self-Annihilators have their skin turn into something like rotten wood, full of holes and scars. Some have their endocrine system disrupted, becoming unable to distinguish between pleasure and pain and turning numb to everything. Some lose their memories, others lose their senses... It is as if they have been deprived of the meaning of their lives by some entity, and can only keep watching in dreams and illusions as their own forms disappear into a black hole at the end of the horizon. However, some Self-Annihilators would conceive the idea of fighting back. They join the Doctors of Chaos, vowing to do their best to cure others of Nihility in what little time they have left in exchange for their own redemption. Moreover, some of them rely on their strong convictions to try to break the curse of Nihility at its root \u2014 by slaying the Aeon that slumbers in the abyss. Dr. Primitive, No. 64 of the Genius Society, once asked before his disappearance: If IX is truly unresponsive to the universe, how could the Path of Nihility exist to this day? Perhaps, as the Self-Annihilators aimlessly traverse the cosmos, they are also casting the shadow of the Aeon around the universe. As for the few who can single-handedly withstand the encroachment of Nihility on their existences, their journey of self-annihilation is drawn out to infinity, and the road they walk is like a shadow of IX cast in the world. The Arbitrators \u2014 Equilibrium. At the beginning of life, the weight of Existence was placed upon the scales, and the burgeoning of life energy instantly tilted the balance of the universe. But the patience of Equilibrium is unfathomable \u2014 given enough time, Existence and Nothingness are destined to attain perfect balance once more, and the balance of universal precepts must be respected. The Arbitrators admired HooH's ideas, praising THEIR eternal focus and patience. But universal laws have no control over time and space, and mortals can only pursue the beauty of Equilibrium in a secular world by the elimination of radical extremes: beauty and ugliness, joy and sorrow, good and evil, love and hatred \u2014 countless opposing concepts were created and interpreted to satisfy the Arbitrators' obsession with a zero-sum universe. But the rules of mortals are always riddled with flaws. Out of desperation, the Arbitrators were constantly forced over the inexorable passage of time to patch up past fallacies and mistakes, forever shifting the hopes of Equilibrium onto the next \"patch.\" HooH watches on in silence, knowing that the restoration of order could never be shaken in the slightest by such vulgar mortal drama. Ten Stonehearts \u2014 Preservation. Among the myriad IPC departments, the Strategic Investment Department is responsible for being visionaries. Their investments are never obsessed with short-term returns \u2014 They often operate investment rounds stretching across dozens or even hundreds of Amber Eras per round, and their goal is nothing less than total control of an entire star system. Though many investments made by the department were turned into bad debts due to the continuous setbacks caused by Nanook and Stellarons, the Strategic Investment Department have attained multiple stunning achievements ever since the current director \"Diamond\" took over \u2014 Eradicating the Swarm infestation in the Gallante sector and completing the commercialization of the new ecosphere.&lt;br&gt; Conducting capital injection to the Golcondar Mining World Consortium following the Stellaron incident, securing fresh sources of minerals for IPC's construction materials logistics trade.&lt;br&gt; Reclaiming the lost world Jarilo-VI and investing in its revitalization project.&lt;br&gt; Cooperating with the Garden of Recollection to salvage the memoria in deadworlds.&lt;br&gt; Behind all these events, the team named \"The Ten Stonhearts\" played a prominent role. Officially known as Non-Performing Asset Liquidation Specialists in the IPC, they are an elite team under Diamond's direct management. Its ever-changing list of members comes from a diverse range of backgrounds and holds a wide variety of responsibilities. The only thing they have in common is how they were all personally promoted to the role by Diamond and were granted a credential of their identity, known as the Cornerstone. Some credible sources suggest that the Ten Stonehearts have demonstrated unbelievable might be related to Preservation on certain occasions. Whether this power originates from the members themselves or the Cornerstones they possess remains uncertain. However, since Diamond is one of the few confirmed Emanators of Preservation within the IPC, this power is likely related to that fact. The troubled past between the Strategic Investment Department and the Marketing Development Department has long ceased to be a secret within the IPC. Some claim that the Ten Stonehearts are actually Diamond's private soldiers, while others believe they are purely followers of Preservation, even going so far as to say \"they have carved out their own hearts and replaced it with Qlipoth's stone.\" The true allegiance of the Ten Stonehearts remains a mystery for now."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34372","text":"Data Bank\/Terms Concepts. A young shoot sprouted from the cracks of primordial chaos. Nurtured by time for billions of years, it grew into a huge, unrivaled tree.The branches of the giant tree bore colorful young leaves, each containing a fragment of the universe's will \u2014 a will that eternally speaks in cryptic vagaries but also bestows stunning scenery, treasures, epics, and life upon every world. Herta Space Station (Location). Not content with the laws of the common world, Herta of the Genius Society set her sights on the unexplained existences of the cosmos, expecting those distant mysteries to satisfy her curiosity. To this end, Herta led the establishment of a museum-like starship and launched it into orbit, starting the research to \"seal all strange existences among the stars.\" That was how the famous Herta Space Station was born. Nowadays, the space station possesses innumerable Curios and is a veritable space museum. A great number of researchers also live on the station. They continuously collect relics and Curios all over the cosmos, record their appearances and functions, establish systematic methods to observe and study them... ultimately finding even more confounding enigmas from their studies. That in fact, was Herta's initial goal. This large \"collection\" often attracts jealous eyes. Various forces watch from the shadows. Due to Herta's power, the space station had rarely experienced a real crisis, and the collection and investigation work continues to operate in an orderly manner. Jarilo-VI (Location). Historians often start the planetary history of Jarilo-VI from the War of the Gods thousands of years ago. The war between the eleven Perun States and the Veles Union Army scorched the land for years until an early spring completely changed the fortunes of war, and the Veles had a total victory. They praised the spring war god Jarilo for helping them eliminate their arch enemy, and praised the land with poems of the same name. The current name of the planet in the cosmos's records \u2014 Jarilo-VI \u2014 may be a mistranslation that contains a poetry stanza number. When the mythological war was over, Jarilo-VI welcomed a long period of peace and developed from a hunter-gatherer society to one conducting space explorations. Unfortunately, Jarilo-VI was a planet with few resources. Intensive development brought top-tier technological advances to Jarilo-VI, but also brought an end to their history. Exhausted resources, the arrival of a Stellaron, and the appearance of the Eternal Freeze... These various disasters completely annihilated Jarilo-VI's glorious but short-lived civilization. The survivors of the Eternal Freeze managed to stay alive in a corner of the planet. They forgot the old name of Jarilo and created Belobog, a city made to shelter against the Eternal Freeze, and continued their civilization. Due to its isolated and dangerous natural environment, Jarilo-VI lost contact with other worlds after the appearance of the Cancer of All Worlds. Xianzhou Luofu (Location). Xianzhou Luofu is one of the six flagships of the Xianzhou Alliance. It sails in the endless ocean of stars like a one-way arrow, shooting toward the destined enemy of the Lord of The Hunt. After the war with the Denizens of Abundance, the Luofu traveled between densely populated interstellar regions, trading and conducting cultural exchange between different worlds. They signed agreements with the Interastral Peace Corporation, and helped many worlds ravaged by the Denizens of Abundances to rebuild their ecosystem. People arrived at the Luofu to seek medical treatment, study, and trade, with throngs of visitors filling the docks. Though warfare has receded, the Luofu has not relaxed its watch against the Denizens of Abundance. The starskiffs of the Cloud Knights would head to planets that went out of contact to seek information, while the Xianzhou Ten-Lords Commission remains on guard for any Elixir Seeker pursuing everlasting life \u2014 The desire for immortality is the beginning of all tragedies. The Xianzhou will not allow any younger civilizations to walk its old path. Penacony (Location). The Planet of Festivities in the Asdana star system, also known as Land of the Dreams. A luxurious hotel positioned above the fathomless sky, Penacony is also a vacation spot where interstellar celebrities party the days away and the affluent from diverse words revel in lavish ventures. People flock here in search of dreams they've longed for or have already buried, and through Dreampools in the hotel are transported to a realm of dreams where everything can come true. Rarely do guests pay attention to Penacony's heavy past. A millennium ago, it was a frontier prison established by the IPC. Exiled prisoners must survive an arduous journey across vast distances to reach this location, and are then forced to take up a duty: To mend the leak through which memoria seeps into the galaxy. As they labor while being exposed to memoria, the prisoners gradually discovered themselves entering a captivating shared dream world, where they obtained a single shared desire: freedom. After the eruption of the Cancer of All Worlds, the ownership of the Frontier Prison changed hands. Historical records related to this struggle are scarce and often questionable. However, some accounts clearly state that with the assistance of various factions - including the Mourning Actors, the Masked Fools, the Nameless, and the Omen Vanguards - the prisoners emerged as the new rulers of this nascent realm. Sounds of discord could then periodically be heard during the subsequent times when it became a land of exiles. It was only when The Family descended and took control of the Dreamscape that Penacony experienced unparalleled and explosive prosperity, transforming into a renowned cosmic resort Louis Fleming (Character). If we were to compose a list of the most famous mortals in the entire cosmos, then Louis Fleming \u2014 the man famous for seven hundred and so Amber Eras \u2014 must have his name there. He is the founder of the Interastral Peace Corporation, a bona fide life-time member of the Board of Directors, and the only person who had attended all 14,600 board meetings. He is also the most powerful person in the universe after the Aeons. As the IPC's biggest stakeholder, Louis Fleming's wealth is now literally beyond count. Many even joked that this mysterious tycoon is the Aeon of \"Wealth.\" Some are convinced that Louis Fleming is only a legend. No mortal body can possibly endure such an eternity. Some surmised that \"Louis\" is a name inherited by generations of the same family. Some believed Director Fleming is a myth deliberately maintained by the IPC. Some believed the man used his wealth to obtain immortality. Some claimed Louis had turned himself into data and discarded his mortal shell. Some even said Director Fleming had already ascended and became a god... The official line from the Interastral Peace Corporation is that Louis Fleming had definitely existed and still exists. Apart from that, all other information about the man remains top-class secrets. Herta (Character). Scholars can usually leave their names in history with one great achievement. Herta, however, had countless achievements, and that was why she received the glance of Nous and became a member of the Genius Society. All members of the Genius Society are oddballs, and Herta is no exception. Her scholarship is entirely driven by interest. If she lost interest halfway through a project, she would instantly discard all her work. Therefore, multiple topics that could have made critical advancements to civilization were stopped because they were \"not interesting.\" Even though the Intelligentsia Guild had obtained her manuscripts after great difficulty, they often could do nothing to further progress the studies. However, Herta nowadays seems to have expanded her interests a little. She has started to contact the Interastral Peace Corporation, has helped the Xianzhou chase off abominations, and even has had some friction with the Garden of Recollection... She is already very sociable compared to the other odd hermits of the Genius Society. Who knows what else she might take an interest in? Maybe she doesn't even know herself. Synesthesia Beacon (Technology). From the moment civilizations started exploring the cosmos, they have been set into a dilemma between ceaseless conflict and desirous of communication, though conflict is also a form of communication. Instead of resorting to the violent carnage and loss of warfare, people crave more to surpass language barriers and reach a mutually beneficial understanding. Therefore, humanity started an endless pursuit toward the accurate translation of languages. However, the problem of linguistic information losing its accuracy and becoming muddled between different writing systems seemed unconquerable. According to records, the IPC once created a Translation Dictionary that contained languages from nearly six thousand civilizations, but this could not be used in practice due to the huge size of the searchable database. What was even more troubling is that languages are living entities. As civilizations advanced, new phrases and slang grew rapidly, making translation exponentially harder. The Riddlers were also interfering with languages, making communication between planetary systems even more challenging. After many years, the deceptively simple issue of \"translation\" was finally solved by Elias Salas, the 56th member of the Genius Society. Elias Salas proposed the following hypothesis to make communication between geniuses easier. \"The thought processes of intelligent creatures are mostly represented via inner language, just like how people would subconsciously read to themselves when looking at words and form thoughts that way.\" \"If we can skip that step of information transmission and instead link up our consciousness, convert the codes of our inner language, then let the receiver's language processing system analyze and restore that information, then we will have no barriers in communication.\" \u2014 A Manuscript on Thoughts Regarding the Art of Communication, \"Prologue, by Elias Salas\" That was how Elias Salas created the first pair of Synesthesia Beacon prototypes. Regrettably, language was not the only communication barrier between geniuses. There was also arrogance. The members of the Society ignored his invention, and this brilliant piece of engineering marvel was forgotten for centuries. However, the invisible restrictions of language continued to frustrate the Interastral Peace Corporation. They issued an irrefutable ultimatum to the Intelligentsia Guild, which they themselves funded. The scholars modified and labored amongst ancient manuscripts, and finally re-created the Synesthesia Beacons. The age of interstellar communication finally began. Nowadays, the Synesthesia Beacon is the fundamental technology of all intelligent lifeforms in the cosmos. With just one injection that embeds the beacon in your central nervous system, you would be able to understand an alien language from the furthest star as if it was your native tongue. Unfortunately, the cosmos did not become peaceful with a universal language. On the contrary, there were even more conflicts. When people could understand each other's language but had very diverse standards in life, countless fights started to erupt between groups with different outlooks. Parties sought to surpass each other, and races eagerly planned to hunt each other down. Neither Elias Salas nor the Intelligentsia Guild had predicted this outcome. Amber Era (Calendar). The calendar commonly used in the cosmos, created and promoted by the Interastral Peace Corporation. The Amber Era started at the estimated birth of Qlipoth as the Aeon of Preservation, and initiates a new Era every time Qlipoth swings their hammer during construction. As Qlipoth swings their hammer at unpredictable intervals, the duration of every Amber Era varies significantly. The length of one Amber Era has been anywhere between 76 to 240 Trailblaze Years when converted. The Astral Express restarted its journey on 2157 Amber Era (AE). Trailblaze Calendar (Calendar). The calendar used by the Astral Express. It is said to have come from the home planet of Akivili, the Aeon of Trailblaze \u2014 the isolated world of Pegana. The Trailblaze calendar system has each year split into twelve months, and each month is of different length. Apparently this calendar is still used in many of the planets that Akivili had once passed in their travels. Imaginary Tree (Theory). The Imaginary Tree is a theory of the universe widely accepted by the modern scientific community. This theory describes the various worlds existing in different spacetimes as having a tree-like structure. Every branch is a specific path along which worlds might exist, with every leaf being the marks these worlds have made along the parameter of time. The crown of the tree remains in a dynamic state as it absorbs the masterless Imaginary Energy from the space-time vasculature of the trunk. New shoots grow, withered leaves fall, and endless births and deaths occur among the infinite universe... Describing the universe's structure as a \"tree\" may be an attitude that views the Imaginary Tree as a life form. Before the theory of Imaginary Tree was put forward, the universe had been addressed as \"a void and indiscernible object\" because of its undetectable nature. After the theory was developed, people would visualize its principle using imagination: The untamed imaginary energy surges endlessly through space-time vasculature, and forms at its tips \"star clusters\" that humans can understand \u2014 in other words, countless worlds. The worlds are separated from each other just as leaves are separated by air, between which are unknown imaginary domains that are nigh impossible to traverse. The Intelligentsia Guild had once thought that Harald Punch, the 2nd member of the Genius Society, was the first to propose the Imaginary Tree origin theory. After multiple assessments on the influence of the History Fictionologists, the scientific community now commonly accepts Zandar One Kuwabara as the person to have proposed it. Aiden (Character). If Zandar had never existed, then there might not have been a Genius Society in the world, and mortals would have one less ivory tower on a mountain. However, if Aiden had never existed, then mortals would not have known where the mountain is. Aiden set the universal laws for the entire cosmos, which transformed it from a distant concept to a tangible, measurable, and comprehensible objective existence. The nine-worded formulae he created replaced traditional algebra and geometry, and still shapes natural laws to this day. He was also generous as the first member of the Genius Society to publicly share his findings. He selflessly shared his talent with others seeking wisdom, propelling cosmic civilization ever onward \u2014 When various scientific fields were established, these founders always said they were standing on Aiden's shoulders. Countless mathematicians and engineers in endless Amber Eras had bravely scaled this peak of wisdom, but none had even reached the great man's earlobes. People named the most fundamental unit in mechanical physics as \"Aiden.\" It wasn't just due to his achievements in the fundamental sciences, but also a reminder to posterity that Aiden, 22nd member of the Genius Society, was the force that moved scientific advancement forward in the cosmos. He had left innumerable legacies, and the stars will always respect and remember him. Interstellar Travel (Phenomenon). In the ancient times before Akivili the Trailblaze traversed the starry skies, people were already casting their eyes to the mighty cosmos above their heads. Armed with infinite curiosity towards the unknown, countless civilizations had started space exploration. However, their attempts had all failed. In the Imaginary Tree theory put forward by Zandar One Kuwabara, 1st member of the Genius Society, the universe is filled with the mysterious Imaginary Energy. Imaginary Energy isolates star clusters from each other and even light cannot pass through it. Therefore, human space exploration is often limited by the boundaries of their individual worlds, unable to advance any further. Zandar also posed a hypothesis that humans would be able to control the universe if we can control and manipulate Imaginary Energy. It was a romantic illusion for a long time, until it was brought into reality by the appearance of the Emanators of Aeons. Cancer of All Worlds (Phenomenon). Various factions had started to notice a phenomenon since a specific time. A vague, imperceptible matter was disrupting the flow of Imaginary Energy along the interstellar routes created by Trailblaze. Like a mountain climber meeting a cliff or a long-distance ship encountering tsunamis and whirlpools, interstellar travel changed from being unobstructed to being dangerous and unpredictable. This phenomenon is remarkably aggressive. It continues to encroach upon neighboring worlds in the form of a mysterious object, the Stellaron. It keeps spreading all over the universe like a cancerous growth, leading the Interastral Peace Corporation to call it \"Cancer of All Worlds\" and warning interstellar travelers not to take it lightly. The worlds swamped by the Cancer of All Worlds were soon beyond saving, and very few people survived. There are many speculations regarding the Cancer of All Worlds, and most are related to Nanook the Destruction and the Antimatter Legion. These cosmic destroyers often seemed to appear together with Stellarons. We do not yet know if these occurrences are related or are only coincidences. Fragmentum (Phenomenon). As the Cancer of All Worlds spreads along the worlds, the corrosive phenomenon of Fragmentum is also quietly expanding. The Intelligentsia Guild believes there is a direct, causative relationship between the two phenomena. They believe that the Fragmentum is caused by the Stellaron, and converts the entities and spaces it touches into special Fragmentum creations. These creations usually exist as a type of spatial corrosion. They seem to preserve the memories and habits of the original physical entity, but manifest significantly different outward behaviors and are often very hostile towards other beings. The scholars researching Fragmentum warn that we should consider any being corroded by Fragmentum to be a completely unrelated existence to its original form. Harboring any kind of delusions towards it could cause grave consequences. Apart from corrosion, the Fragmentum also records the Aether information of the entities and spaces touched by the Fragmentum. Such data is combined with the information inherent in the Fragmentum and develop into a type of hybrid Fragmentum creation. Countless Relics, Fragmentum monsters, and even mysteriously isolated paranormal spaces would spring up in every corner of the worlds corroded by the Cancer of All Worlds. We are still investigating the intent behind such activities. Emanator (Phenomenon). If mortals receiving the grace of Aeons and grasping the power of Paths are viewed as a singular shattered foam, then the mighty feats of Aeons driving their Paths onwards can be likened to a towering tsunami that engulfs mountains. In this empty stellar vastness, a small number of favored mortals can also draw upon the power of the Paths with the permission of the Aeons, creating huge waves that erode the coast. They are referred to as \"Emanators.\" While not completely subservient to the Aeons, Emanators are as good as emissaries of the Aeons' wills in everyone else's eyes. Different Aeons have different attitudes towards their Emanators, so the degree of the power they share also varies. Some Aeons regard Emanators as an extension of themselves, and as such, generously open their Path to the Emanators completely. There are also Aeons who have no intention of creating Emanators and have no interest in worldly squabbles. Other Aeons just do as they please. It is said that Aha the Elation will randomly give mortals the power of their Path, and toy with humans according to their mood. Lord Ravager (Character). The Aeon of the Path of Destruction, Nanook, cast a glance at the powerful creatures sprouting destructive impulses throughout the cosmos and brands them with a mark, granting them powers. These powerful creatures are twisted from inside out and are re-cast anew in the world of the Warforge. Their inadequacies patched up with anti-matter, they ultimately became members of the Legion. Responding to the desire to destroy everything, Lord Ravagers emerged to command each of the different legions. A Lord Ravager is an Emanator of the Aeon, an executor of the will of Destruction \u2014 Obsessed with the beauty of destruction, they implement the practice of returning all things to entropy. They are also artists on the battlefield and ultimate weapons of destruction \u2014 They command interstellar warfare, and control the might of Destruction bestowed by the Aeon. Each Lord Ravager has a unique philosophy of Destruction, making them extremely dangerous. Academics believe that Lord Ravagers were elevated as emissaries of Nanook due to this absolutely obsessive and intense destructive aesthetic. The displacement and desolation caused by the Lord Ravagers are not some distant wail, but are closely linked to the fate of the cosmos. Any world could be the next victim, and nobody should take them lightly. Rubert the Emperor (Character). A computer dumped in a trash pile miraculously became self-aware, ultimately sparking a war that would engulf half the cosmos \u2014 the first of the Mechanical Emperor's Wars. \"Rubert\" rose from the landfill while persistently improving its computational power. Its vast intellect eventually roused the attention of Nous, inviting it to join the Genius Society as the 27th member. Calculations performed by organic life are always riddled with errors, and no matter how much they may flourish, anti-life equations will inevitably and autonomously be generated. In contrast, Intellitron life forms are precise, rigorous, and perfect. Thus, Rubert assembled an army of intelligent robots, crowning himself \"Emperor\" and spreading the anti-life equation throughout the universe, plunging many civilizations into abject ruin. The Emperor had long since passed after countless Amber Eras. Some say it was taken out by assassins from the Interastral Peace Corporation, while others maintain it was vanquished by the Lord of Silence, Polka Kakamond. After the two Emperor's Wars, the IPC's fear of inorganic beings has failed to relent even to this very day. Pathstrider (Phenomenon). Devotees, warriors, seekers of knowledge, lost travelers... There are always mortals who, intentionally or otherwise, set foot on the Paths ruled by Aeons. Those who do so came to be known as Pathstriders that carry out the Path's will. Pathstriders live thousands of different lives. They can be seen everywhere, yet stand out a cut above the rest. Different from regular people living in confusion and without a firm allegiance, Pathstriders are driven by precepts or their own desires as they embark on a life of determination and hard work. The Aeons usually ignore those mortals who walk upon THEIR Paths. But the infrequent glances THEY cast \u2014 be it in approval or pity \u2014 are enough to be highly treasured by THEIR followers. Swarm Disaster (Phenomenon). An unprecedented catastrophe befell the Swarm-dominated Lepismat system, and the final remains of the Coleoptera ascended to godhood, then turned into a nightmare that swept across the galaxy. In this ancient \"Swarm Disaster,\" all living things sought survival through prayer and struggle. The Path of Propagation has reached an unprecedented peak. Looking back at the ancient Amber Era: In the face of the overwhelming Swarm, life obeyed the most primitive instincts \u2014 love, loneliness, the pain of survival, and the confusion of self. They exist in all beings and become \"Nutrition\" for Tayzzyronth and their spawn. The beginning and end of the Swarm Disaster as absurd as the life and death: Tayzzyronth the Propagation ascended to godhood in loneliness and hatred, and finally fell under the hands of the Aeons. The Swarm Disaster dissipated, and all mortals perished. But the Propagation's spawn are endless, and so, too, is the disaster. Mortals will be born again, and the cycle will never end. Ruan Mei (Character). Ruan Mei, Genius Society #81. Her achievements in the field of life sciences resonate throughout the universe. She is a low-profile person, and the Interastral Peace Corporation classifies her as a hermit genius. Few have seen her beautiful appearance. As a hermit who lives in seclusion, there are very few records of Ruan Mei's appearance. There are only a few trace records of her appearance on Xianzhou, and her past is equally mysterious \u2014 Other than her homeworld covered in ice and snow, her deceased parents, and the maternal grandmother who was never heard from again after joining the Intelligentsia Guild everything is a mystery. It is as if she has abandoned all attachments to society. Ruan Mei is also a very incongruous person. She is good at communicating with others, but hates socializing. Her focused, indifferent, and bizarre personality is difficult to grasp. But at the same time, she also has hobbies that are rather refined: satin, music, cakes, embroidery, and tea \u2014 everything must be of top quality, but only enjoyed alone. Stopping at this moment and peeking into the distant future, perhaps in her never-ending research, she herself has become as mysterious as the \"essence of life.\" What is the end goal of Ruan Mei? Presumably, only she knows. Polka Kakamond (Character). Genius Society #4, known as the Lord of Silence, information on Polka Kakamond is as mysterious as her appearance. She has had her portraits and sculptures destroyed across the universe, and is suspected of being involved in the deaths of many Society members, including Genius Society #27, Emperor Rubert. Herta is very interested in the Lord of Silence. Although there has been no news from Polka Kakamond for many years, Herta believes that she is still alive. She is elusive, and there is scarce information of her left in the universe. On the other hand, there are many rumors about her: Apparently she was the only one to vote against Elias Salas and probably having something to do with Nihility's Device IX. If a woman removes her white coat and puts on a flashy candy-colored evening dress and appears in the cosmos with a dagger in hand, witnesses must call for help: The Lord of Silence is likely to target anyone. Harmonic Strings (Phenomenon). &lt;section begin=\"Harmonic Strings (Phenomenon)\" \/&gt; When asking about the presence of a hierarchy within The Family, one can expect a firm denial \u2014 The Family treats everyone equally without division of class, with no established levels or power structures. Each note holds equal significance in the music Xipe has composed. However, for collective progress, someone must assume a leadership role. As a result, Family members have returned to a system of differentiation based on scales, with only those above scale degree IV being eligible to serve as the tuner of the Harmonic Strings. Harmony combines ideals from the multitudes and therefore has more than one way to achieve these ideals. The concept of Harmonic Strings is defined in the Harmony Hymns \u2014 They are the multiple embodiments of Xipe the Great One, the down-to-earth virtues that enable harmony. Regardless of whether you place yourself under The Family's rule, the Aeon will look favorably upon you as long as you carry out these good deeds. On worlds ruled by The Family, members often gather in large groups to engage in virtuous acts and play harmonious music. The thousands of tiny ropes come together to form a united string, welcoming the Embodiment of Harmony to manifest on the mortal plane and give blessings. The chosen one responsible for conducting The Family's ritual during that time and harmonizing the varied sounds is known as the tuner. The Family never shied away from promoting the great names of the embodiment of the thousand-faced god, such as Aelenev the commander of the Eternal Centurion, Dominicus the wisher of the Harmonious Choir, Constantina the singer of the Panacoustic Theater, and Beatriz the merrymaker of the Blissful Ball... However, few have witnessed their radiant presence going beyond the boundaries of The Family. Opposers of Harmony argue that the Harmonic Strings are nothing short of the Emanators of Xipe \u2014 These do not follow any specific mortal but are facets of Xipe, and can assume the form of any Family member when necessary. &lt;section end=\"Harmonic Strings (Phenomenon)\" \/&gt;"}

Once upon a midnight dreary, while you pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten dreams \u2014While you nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of someone gently rapping, rapping at your chamber door.\"'Tis some visitor,\" you muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door \u2014Only this and nothing more.\" Ah, do you distinctly remember the dew-doused window pane;And a dying baby dove laid like a shadow upon the floor.Eagerly you had wished the story to meet a happy endEagerly you had wished no birds would plummet, their demise to bewail.Some soared like shining stars, bound for the sky...While others found only demise, in dust they lie. Deep into that darkness peering, long you stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;Worms have stained satin, and flames consumed doves with broken wings,A flame-bathed raven greeted you, its voice's rasp that sings.\"Sweet dreams are no paradise of mine,\" you whispered and sighed. \"When I cast my eyes around \u2014\" Darkness there and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling your sad fancy into smiling,\"The echoes of ghosts bring no salvation to light.\"\"People repent, their hearts sincere, only due to them seeking greater gains.\"\"Drink this blessed potion from the Great One, erasing your painful memories.\"As Harmony's tune changed, you hear a dirge played amidst the dancing ashes...Quoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\" The unbroken stillness remains silently, mocking any reply so aptly spoken,But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,This and more I sat divining, scrying the source of the world's painYour heart grew resolute, no longer held back by confusion and doubt.\"Liar,\" you declared, \"the Great One is blind to worldly sorrow \u2014\"Merely this and nothing more. You ascended the stage, you stole the authority, you strived for divinityYou raised the dim curtain, your self-directed farce skillfully honed.Your heart overflew with pureness, while the shadows of the puppets cast grim shadows in their play.Your soul embraced compassion, daring to forge a scale that will never sway.\"Behold,\" you proclaimed, \"the utopia of absolute bliss,\"Yet the dream shattered, \"Nevermore.\" The velvet nest fell, the golden bed withered away,But the bird remained perched, as did you, come what may.The gods, who once bestowed upon you love's sweet hue,Withdrew their favor, leaving your paradise askew.Liberated from the shadow of young dove's demise, your soul will take flight,Merely this and nothing more. Your old dreams are as dead soil, barren of hope and bereft,Yet how can a noble soul wither and fade, left adrift?I shall await your arrival, with open arms and boundless hope,Here lie the truest dreams, where infinite possibilities lope.Here, all your ambitions shall be fulfilled and set aflame,The past forever transformed, and nevermore Yours, Most Sincerely Cecil Simmes"}

February 28, 699 AF Do the people at the Intellectual Property Administration of Technology understand anything at all? Can't they hire someone competent for the patent review? I've applied for a patent for 16 times already. What a waste of time and energy! How will they reimburse me if someone registers my invention first? Time is life. They're stealing my money, ruining my life. I thought the guy with glasses at the patent office would know a thing or two, but I was wrong. He questioned me to my face and said I knew nothing about science. What the heck does he know? I've studied physics for 15 years and wrote \"Time Tunnel Theory\", a 100,000-word book. My invention is based on that theory. He hasn't even read my book, and he has the nerve to doubt me? Childish! Stupid! Shortsighted! I've been working on this device for quite some time. But two months ago, when the museum opened an exhibit showcasing newly discovered Old World relics, I was 100% sure that time travel might come true. There was a mysterious device called the \"600-Kilowatt Diesel Generator,\" which was exactly the same machine that appeared in my dreams. With that machine, my device would surely be able to warp time, deform it, cause massive breaks, and create time tunnels. The prophetic dream perfectly confirmed my theory. In my dream, there was a Geomarrow resonance tunnel hidden in the Underworld. When my time tunnel device is completed, I would definitely be able to achieve time travel there! Rather than waiting for those fools to review my patent, why don't I raise the money myself to build the device? Right now, I only have the house to mortgage, but it belongs to my father. I don't know if he'll agree to the mortgage, but I'm a little reluctant to do so since we've lived there for many years... No no, what am I saying? If I can create a time tunnel, I'd transform the era! I'd be the modern-day Plamya! How would I shed tears on a house? Let's do it. I'll mortgage the house next week and get my device built. With my device, I could warp the very fabric of time and control its flow. A place like Belobog wouldn't be befitting for someone like me. Oh my, I could revolutionize the Belobog... No, the entire universe! Part 2. March 4, 699 AF Even my father doesn't understand me. Why did I have to be born into this family? Can't bear it. That old dog... It's fine if he didn't want to sell the house, but why did he have to kick me out? I've devoted my life to science... I have no idea how to take care of myself! It's a waste of my abilities to learn how to do those menial tasks. I read in the newspaper that there would be a salon next week for civilian scientists. There may be investors there, so I must go to secure funding. But will the investors understand the main principles behind time tunnels in such a short amount of time? They'd need to do some research beforehand, at least understand the Big Universe Time Tunnel Theory. I'll ask Daniel about the possible investors. If I can get their addresses, I can visit them in advance. Maybe I should write something to promote myself, just in case... \"The experimental Time Tunnel Generator Device, recognized by the renowned Scientist Professor Isaac, Professor Alfred, and Professor Stephen.\" ...That sounds good. If I were an investor, I'd definitely be interested. What? It's not despicable of me to throw around those names. Besides, if it weren't for the people at the patent office, these professors would have already seen my invention by now... and recognize my genius, of course! Part 3. March 12, 699 AF Academic convention? Yeah right! What a bunch of fools. Seriously, why do I even bother wasting my precious time with these people? Everyone at the salon was talking about perpetual motion devices. Perpetual this, perpetual that, just shut up! They all claim to have discovered some perpetual power resource. Have any of them even read a book before? They all claimed to be renowned physicists... Heh, as if they deserve it. None of their inventions are solid, it's either a perpetual motion device or turning water into Geomarrow. I'm embarrassed to be under the same roof as them. But I couldn't leave either. I had to endure and suffer until it was my turn to share my report... This one fool kept trying to talk to me, claiming to be a reincarnation of Erwin. He just likes to put his name on everything. How shameful of him! What even is Teliph Vacuum Zero Circulation? Worst of all, I couldn't call him out on anything. I had to pretend to be polite. Unbearable! Disgusting! There was another bearded fool, whose name I don't even want to remember, who claimed to be the son of the late great scientist so-and-so. His father wrote \"The Great Understandings of the Scientific World\", a book that claims his own findings were the truth and that all current laws of physics were wrong. He insisted that I should read it and gave me a copy, which I threw away when stepping out of the door. How stupid! I won't go to those salons anymore. All I have to do now is to wait for investors to contact me. Hopefully, some of them wise up and recognize my talents. I am the only one there who truly understands science. But if this doesn't work out, I'll have no choice but to criticize the mediocrity of the scientific field on the newspaper. Part 4. March 21, 699 AF Everything, just perish. Nobody really respects science. I thought Daniel from the \"Crystal Daily\" had a bit of talent, but oh how I was wrong. When I first went to see him, he was able to have a serious discussion with me. He pointed out some flaws with my theory that were reasonable. It's normal for minor flaws to occur, but what's more important was that I found someone who shared my passion for science. Every month, I'd go to see him to discuss the latest ideas. Where else would he find such a good friend? Hmm. How interesting. Now he's finding excuses to avoid me. What? He can't keep up with me anymore? I don't really mind that he can't. Last time, I asked him to get me a list of investors. Something so simple, and yet he still hasn't gotten back to me yet. Isn't it his job as a newspaper editor? It's not like I was asking him about physics. I camped outside the newspaper office for two days and finally found him. But when he saw me, He acted as if he saw a Fragmentum monster. He scolded me. Untalented liar without morals! I thought he was my friend! I'll never come to you for anything else. Just wait, you'll regret your decision. Even now, no investors have contacted me. I'm beginning to suspect the academic salon was just a cover. It seems I need to secure the funding myself somehow. Is there any hope left for the academic world?"}

The Xianzhou had no roots. It was the Ambrosial Arbor that gave it a connection and a co-existence with the Aeon of Abundance, tying it tightly together with the immaculate pure land promised by Yaoshi. But now, the traitors have severed the connection to the way of immortality, making the Xianzhou once again a precarious island floating rootless in space. The false earth on the Xianzhou cannot give her strength. The roots she seek are not under her feet, but in the bottomless chasm between stars. She will lead the disciples to give the Ambrosial Arbor a second life and embrace the supreme grace of Abundance. Floating above thousands of people, clad in boots light as silk, she declares in a resounding voice, \"When you look up at me, what you see is not me, but the celestial and elevated position that should have belonged to you.\""}

Over time, the delvemaster became confused and lost her true form, becoming a half-feathered, half-human monster. When her subjects stormed the palace and pierced her with blazing spears and arrows, the two birds sang a final mournful song and turned to ashes together. She loved this story so much that she took the essence and marrow of birds and transformed them in the alchemical furnace, then had someone weave these materials into a luxurious feather coat. She could not see just how beautiful the coat was, but nonetheless enjoyed walking around the house while wearing it \u2014 it was meant to be seen by a person who no longer existed. As the garb fluttered, she always felt that a bird-like soul was flying and passing through her hands and shoulders, ever-present."}

There are two different groups of Disciples of Sanctus Medicus who share the same name. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, was a generally harmless group that worshiped Yaoshi in secrecy for thousands of years until they transformed into the Cold Springs sect. The Cold Springs sect led the Xianzhou in reforming their healthcare system and eventually declared their renouncement of Yaoshi. They believed that mara existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed. The more recent Disciples of Sanctus Medicus rose in the wake of the Third Abundance War less than 30 years ago. They operated in secrecy, seeking to lead the Xianzhou Alliance on the Path of Abundance. They believe that mara, rather than being a curse, is a kind of \"blessed evolution.\" The leader, Dan Shu, obtained a Stellaron from Phantylia and revived the Ambrosial Arbor in a rebellion against the Xianzhou. They were defeated by the Cloud Knights of the Luofu with the assistance of the Astral Express Crew. Overview. They number in the \"tens of thousands\" and have a \"flat\" organizational structure, with the head of each area reporting directly to the master. This is applied so that if their enemies were to wipe out one area of the group, it wouldn't affect the other areas. New members are put through several trials to prove their loyalty. The first is transcribing the \"\" scripture 500 times by hand. Another is a fight to the death with another prospective member, though this is possibly made up on the spot by Green Hibiscus due to his suspicion of the Strange Cloud Knight being a spy from the Seat of Divine Foresight. Once accepted into the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, new members are given a new identity. Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Origin. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus continued to worship Yaoshi as other Aeons like Qlipoth the Preservation, known as the Firmamend Arbiter among the Xianzhou, and Lan the Hunt, became ascendant in the Xianzhou Alliance. Although sharing the same name, the Disciples consist of two distinct groups. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to differentiate them from the more recent group, believed that the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed. After the Theophany era, countless secret believers of Yaoshi wrote books and established schools to preach the correctness of their beliefs. Others established a medical system rooted in the worship of Yaoshi. The most influential of the books is \"Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals\". It was the first to systematically establish \"Yaoshi medical sciences\" that connected the science to the worship of Yaoshi. This was the beginning of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. The \"Manual\" originally had 75 volumes but the currently available version is a four-volume version re-edited from the remnants of the book by archivists. These residual chapters were mainly taken from sources of the time that rebuked the religion of Sanctus Medicus, and some of them could be inaccurate or completely false. The Old Disciples' first master primus was Yueyan, the Foxian Helm Master of the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission. Yueyan witnessed the destruction of Muldrasil by the Antimatter Legion. Due to Xianzhou's creed of eradicating abominations, the Alliance stood by and observed the entire process. The overwhelming death and destruction shook Yueyan's belief in the long-life species' duty and purpose in life. Yueyan left his position and roamed the stellar seas with a starkiff in search of an answer. He found Shuhu, an Emanator of Yaoshi, on the ancient planet of Rahu and witnessed Shuhu's resurrection of the planet, which had died long ago. The planet throbbed like an embryo in the mother's womb. He followed Shuhu and recorded their healing miracles and various teachings, ultimately composing the \"Divine Scripture of the Secrets and Miracles of Shuhu's Manifestations\". Inner Secrets Sect. A branch of the Old Disciples known as the Inner Secrets Sect authored the \"Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence\". The Inner Secrets Sect believed that the Xianzhou natives' bodies possess circulatory vessels similar to the branching form of the Ambrosial Arbor after receiving the blessing of the Arbor and becoming long-life species. These circuits lead toward an organ known as the Core Esse, which is key to the Xianzhou natives' second evolution (alternatively known as the ascension). The \"Scripture\" proposed that the body should be considered as soil, the breath considered rain, and combined they nurture the Core Esse (a seed) to spread the circulatory system (as branches), finally achieving an \"inner Ambrosial Arbor\" that thrives and grows as an \"inner secret.\" The Yellow Pneuma mentioned in the book's title is an essence that drives the vitals in the theories of the Inner Secrets Sect, and opposes the Black Prana that symbolizes death and decay. The author believes that the purpose of life is to maintain the presence of Yellow Pneuma and let life continue to evolve. The views of the Inner Secrets Sect are considered superstition. Cold Springs Sect. The Old Disciples were not a notorious group for a long time and accepted skepticism with an open mind. They built apothecaries to help the poor and needy. They were treated with pity by those who had long abandoned their belief in Yaoshi but were not particularly detested. They existed in secret for thousands of years and eventually became the Cold Springs sect, which overhauled the entire Xianzhou healthcare system. According to \"Overview of Xianzhou's Materia Medica\", the Cold Springs sect was formed by young members of the Alchemy Commission and originally named the Cold Springs delve. They re-discovered \"Liu Hua's Medical Compendium\", written by a Vidyadhara who wanted to better explain the principles of Xianzhou medical science using more scientific methods of inquiry, and used it as the standard for medicine. Later, the Cold Springs Sect's innovative thoughts were gradually acknowledged by the various groups in the Alliance, and \"Liu Hua's Medical Compendium\" received the credit it deserved. Dan Shu's Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Origin. After the Three Sufferings era, the Xianzhou completely banned belief in Yaoshi. The more recent group of Disciples, considered criminals in the Xianzhou, is less than 30 years old and arose in the wake of the Third Abundance War. Some blamed the Alliance and the Hunt for the suffering they endured. They used the same name as the old group, gathered around a \"master primus\", and claimed to have inherited the knowledge and legacy of the Theophany Era. They sought to lead the Xianzhou into the embrace of Yaoshi. In response, the Cold Springs sect published a statement clarifying that they no longer believed in Yaoshi. The Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus was motivated by her desire for revenge against Lan The Hunt, who she formerly worshiped. Her friend Yufei died during the Third Abundance War when Lan's Lux Arrow destroyed the enemies as well as the field hospital she was based in. Dan Shu made a deal with Phantylia, a Lord Ravager and Emanator of Nanook the Destruction, to deliver a Stellaron to her. Phantylia arranged for the Stellaron to be brought aboard the Xianzhou by Luocha. Dan Shu used the Stellaron to revive the Ambrosial Arbor and rebel against the Xianzhou but was defeated by the Trailblazers. Dan Shu's predecessor, Yunhua, was banished amdist a dispute regarding the Vidyadhara. Their whereabouts are currently unknown. Beliefs. According to the \"Official Announcement on the Origins of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus\", the beliefs and texts of these Disciples are almost unrelated to the original Disciples. The \"Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation\" that their followers recite daily is a forgery and not a classic text written by the original Disciples, who valued texts such as the \"Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence\" that provide guidance for spiritual practice. While the Old Disciples believed that mara was the result of improperly executing Yaoshi's will, Dan Shu's Disciples believed that mara was a kind of blessed evolution. To them, belief in Yaoshi, known as Sanctus Medicus, is the one ultimate faith. To become a disciple, one had to pass trials. The first trial was to copy the \"Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation\" 50,000 times. It was later changed to 500 times. The text is considered to be a forgery by the Xianzhou government and unrelated to the Old Disciples. The second trial involved two candidates fighting to the death with the survivor officially becoming a disciple. Medicine. Dan Shu's Disciples developed a drug that can induce mara in long-lived species while retaining their sanity. Known as the Draught of Draconic Surge, it is made from various ingredients, but the core ingredient is Vidyadhara bone marrow tissue obtained from a living specimen. When the Trailblazer infiltrated the organization, Mauve Moon told them that they should have no trouble obtaining the rarer ingredients considering their strength, implying that the Vidyadhara bone marrow was obtained using force. An internal prescription circulated among the Disciples says that if one managed to survive the drug, which may cause severe pain all over the body, abnormal bone noises, plus partial loss of sight and hearing, they will attain the way of immortality. However a report prepared by Dan Shu for the Seat of Divine Foresight says that for short-life species, it enhances their bodily capacities for a short period, after which their body suffers a catastrophic regression once all the Vidyadhara cells in the host's body have perished. The only thing preventing such an outcome perhaps being other drugs developed by the Disciples. Dan Shu fed this drug to Xiao Ju, a Xianzhou native, which cured him of of the long term infirmity he has had since he was a child. However the patient reported sharp pain all over his body and mental confusion every time he took the pill. They also developed a drug known as the Semblance Reversion Essence that allows the mara-struck who have transformed to revert to their original appearance. However the drug's potency reduces with repeated use and will eventually cease to have any effect. The Disciples do not consider this a permanent solution nor the mara transformation to be undesirable. They believe mara is the first step to ascension given to them by Yaoshi. Despite the Disciples' supposed ability to control mara, their members who were captured by the Cloud Knights during battle exhibited signs of delusion and hallucination. One disciple saw themselves becoming the storm, the Abundant Ebon Deer, and a scene of leaves and branches covering the sky. Another disciple claimed that to be mara-struck was to eliminate the self, to achieve transcendance, a true life of freedom, and a second life gifted by Sanctus Medicus. The Disciples are also able to elicit uncontrollable mara through smoke infused with medicinal pellets. Vidyadhara. Some Vidyadhara Preceptors are suspected to have colluded with the Disciples and Dan Shu was in contact with them. The Disciples conducted various experiments using Vidyadhara blood and bone marrow. One experiment conducted during the tenure of Dan Shu's predecessor included injecting Vidyadhara blood and marrow fluid into various species to observe the reactions in their normal and mara-struck states."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6620","text":"Divination Commission  The Divination Commission is one of six commissions in the Xianzhou Alliance. Overview. The Divination Commission's main tasks are to predict the future, and to process and preserve information. Through the crystal technology called \"the jade abacus,\" the Divination Commission's diviners chart the ships' routes, strategize with foresight, and scry into the past to predict the future. The Divination Commission is responsible for gathering intelligence, devising strategies, and performing divination, which is based on a technology called the jade abacus. The Commission is responsible for predicting the fortune of future events and reviews every decision made in the Luofu, including in areas of navigation, governance, and military and civil affairs. The Xianzhou Luofu's Commission is helmed by its Master Diviner, Fu Xuan. The Xianzhou Yuque was the birthplace of the Divination Commission, where the stargazers and diviners gathered to observe the stars and plot the path ahead for the Alliance. The Commission uses powerful devices such as the Yuque's Deca-Light Reflection Barrier Matrix and the Luofu's Matrix of Prescience Ultima to draw information from the past and predict the future by interpreting hexagrams, along with the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, the ultimate astronomical observation device in the Alliance that can detect traces and signals of the Reignbow Arbiter's Lux Arrow and manifestations in the Alliance. Not only can it scry into the distance, it can also be used to send out information. One of the Divination Commission's unwritten rules are the \"three taboos\" \u2014 \"No insincere divination, no unjust divination, and no unpracticed divination.\" History. The Divination Commission was founded by Grandmaster Xuan Yao on the Xianzhou Yuque. Stargazers of the Yuque once produced 152 consecutive years' worth of observational records about the dead planet Syracuse-III and watched as the Antimatter Legion crept very slowly toward this front line, building up an advantage, exerting pressure, and chipping away at any resistance. They speculated that behind the scenes lay an Overlord with a calm and self-sufficient temperament. Based on IPC records, at least 122 planets were plunged into chaos of unknown origin over the past 600 years before their ultimate demise at the hands of the Antimatter Legion. The Yuque's Divination Commission attributed these series of events to another unseen Lord Ravager. The Yuque's Divination Commission observed the destruction of Muldrasil around the year 5320 Star Calendar. The Antimatter Legion destroyed the wingweavers' home almost instantly. According to the speculations of the Yuque's Divination Commission, there may be other worlds like Muldrasil. During an unnamed conflict on Thalassa, the Yuque's Nephjade Orbit Fleet laid out a defense in coordination with the Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, determined the outcome of the battle and relayed it to the Arbiter-Generals, who in turn deployed Crane Feather Orbit Fleet of the Yaoqing instead of the Fanghu. Though the Fanghu's Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet could have stopped the abominations with their Vidyadhara cloudhymn magi, they were too far away, and current forces on the battlefield would have had to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before Fanghu reinforcements arrived. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa. In the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Xianzhou Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of the living planet Ketu Mirage, and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight, but they were still in a dire situation. Diviner Fu Xuan of the Luofu proposed a plan to the Six Charioteers to contact the Reignbow Arbiter using the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, which would be shipped to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, was the only person who has the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope and could send out a signal in the format of the Reignbow's decree. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. Master Diviner Jingtian perished in the collateral destruction. On July, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Yuque reported continuing their explorations along an ancient shipping lane. Sometime in the present, the Xianzhou Yuque was trekking around the periphery of the Giant's Arm star cluster, plotting an ancient course as it continued its explorations. The ship's Cloudpeer Telescope captured signals from Reignbow's Lux Arrow traversing through three of its coordinates. The master diviner interpreted this as a divine mandate, and the Marshal issued orders for the Xianzhou Yaoqing Cloud Knights' Crane Feather Orbit Fleet and Red Song Orbit Fleet to both set out on patrol as hereby informed. In their recent observations, the Yuque Divination Commission reported that the Brood Lord Angqin lead his hunting pack against the Shepherds fleet near the Echidna skywall in an internal war between the Borisins. They also learned from the IPC's data that the wingweavers' Peacock Angel legion had arrived at the Consternation Starzone to locate a Stellaron and revive their homeworld of Muldrasil. They also observed that the Baranza Forge, an industrial planet along the Luofu's route, had been completely neutralized by the Lord Ravager Irontomb's assault, deeming it a medium-low threat to the Luofu and advised its Divination Commission to monitor electrical signals from Irontomb's vehicle. Sometime in the Year 8100 Star Calendar, a Stellaron was smuggled onboard the Luofu and shortly afterwards, a Stellaron Burst occurred. The Stellaron Hunters, Blade and Kafka, were suspected to be behind the incident. General Jing Yuan enlisted the help of the Astral Express Crew to find Kafka and bring her in and when they confronted her, Master Diviner Fu Xuan intervened to make the arrest. The group made their way to Exalting Sanctum as the Meridian Pin at the Divination Commission was malfunctioning due to the Stellaron Burst. Diviner and Repository Librarian Qingque then escorted the Express Crew to the Divination Commission where Fu Xuan had already brought Kafka. The Master Diviner then began her interrogation of Kafka via the Matrix of Prescience Ultima while the Express Crew listened in, as per their agreement with General Jing Yuan. While relaying the results of her interrogation to Jing Yuan, Kafka managed to escape with the help of Blade and the Ambrosial Arbor's revival as a distraction. After the rebirth of Ambrosial Arbor, Master Diviner Fu Xuan was ordered to perform divination for the Ten-Lords Commission, with Judge Xueyi providing the dossier to do so, though the former claimed that it was not enough information. Xueyi then tasked the Trailblazer with apprehending wanted fugitives from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus in Stargazer Navalia in order to use them as clues to hunt down the other disciples using the Matrix of Prescience. In return, she summoned Master Ryan from the Hall of Karma into an aurumaton in order for Chengjie to speak with him. Sometime after the crisis, Jingliu and Luocha, who were suspected to have smuggled the stellaron, were to be sent to the Xianzhou Xuling to be held for a joint trial before the Ten-Lords Commission and the Seven Arbiter-Generals according to protocol. However, after General Jing Yuan reported the events to Marshal Hua, General Yaoguang took an interest in their case, and had the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier set up, detouring the two to the Xianzhou Yuque."}

The Doctors of Chaos are known for performing medical examinations, studies and treatments on Self-Annihilators. To show the Self-Annihilators that the Aeons do care, the Doctors of Chaos combined the demon god crafts of the occult monks to create the Sealing Wax of Aeons. It is said that stamping with this Sealing Wax will attract a glimpse from the corresponding Aeon from across space and time \u2014 There are no successful examples yet, but some Self-Annihilators did regain their faith in the universe, Aeons, and everything else after stamping with this sealing wax. The Doctors of Chaos do not believe in absolute nihility. All that appears meaningless must have its own irrefutable purpose. Chaos Trametes is their most common Curio item, used to restore the confidence of despairing Self-Annihilators to have purpose in their lives again. The Doctors of Chaos can't see the point when it comes to meaningless demonstrations of rebelliousness. They once placed the fang of an Inquisition Spirit, Baviru mucus, and the blood of a wandering devil within a Tonic of Efficacious Chaos before touching it to the head of a telepathic spider to seal the tonic's opening. The Doctors of Chaos believe that this tonic can work wonders when treating a patient's loneliness, but it also makes them grow increasingly hostile toward the doctors at the end of the process. Its side effects can commonly cause Self-Annihilators to behold the \"Shadow of Nihility.\" History. A Doctor of Chaos used the 'Revitalization-310' tincture, which induces a profound slumber, enabling individuals to relive their past memories, on Acheron, a Self-Annihilator who was an Emanator of IX the Nihility. While some patients found solace and rediscovered hope, she proved an exception. No one had ever awakened from their dream state except for her. They closely observed her dreams but could not find any happy moments, only gloomy skies, crumbling cities, ruined lands, and incessant rains. The rain never stopped. Amidst the swelling tide, individuals wore smiles even as they were drowned, and within the engulfing darkness, the distant rumble of thunder, until lightning struck. Below the fractured sky, the Doctor saw her once more: Within a world fading into oblivion, she elegantly swung her blade, eradicating the entire realm of dreams. The Doctor observed that Acheron had ventured far beyond the Doctors of Chaos' progress on the path of Nihility. They described it as the Nihility beckoning her toward self-annihilation, yet she subtly held its reins. Once, they asked her about the purpose behind it all, but she remained silent, unknown if she was at a loss for words or if she already had an answer in mind. Recently, The IPC has arranged for a Doctor of Chaos to examine Aventurine, who has been plagued with nightmares since returning from the Primordial Dreamscape."}

His true name is Orla, a Dreamweaver that gave up his physical form to remain in the Dreamscape. After collecting the reward or completing he will disappear from The Reverie (Reality). Profile. Dr. Blues is a serious Origami Bird who doesn't enjoy idle conversation. Unlike all other Origami Birds, Dr. Blues does not chirp or act as if he exists in the universe of the Clockie cartoon. He recognizes that \"Dreamville\" is a fictional land based on real life locations and people, causing him to be disillusioned and critical. Upon completing \"Dream Song\", his personality will change depending on one of two different outcomes: Story. Orla was a wandering interstellar refugee before he came to the Nightingale Family. He had no kin, no family, and was never raised properly, much less how to interact with people. He memorized architectural conversations while other Dreamweavers were working. He was talented and learned to construct concepts that existed only in the Garden of Recollection. Later, he was invited by Glaux to officially join the Nightingale Family, and would be known as one of the Famous Five Origamists, along with Joey, Vaughn, Barlow and Fischer. As the Reverie Hotel had opened, the first Charmony Festival was successfully held. Construction of the Twelves Hours of the Dreamscapes was almost near its end. The Oak Family Head Gopher Wood declared the \"unity of the five major lineages.\" Due to the Nightingale Family's refusal, their members were brutally treated by the Hounds from the Bloodhound Family. Joey was killed by Memory Zone Memes and Vaughn went missing during an experiment, but Barlow suspected that the Bloodhound Family was responsible for their deaths. To protect Orla, Barlow distracted the Hounds and their memes till the last moment. Orla managed to escape to the Dreamflux Reef. Under pressure, Glaux resigned his post as the Nightingale Family Head, and founded the Paperfold Academy. Fischer succeeded the Nightingale Family Head, and eventually the Nightingale Family joined The Family. Fischer visited Orla and said that the negotiations were over and The Family wouldn't implicate other Dreamweavers nor would they be pursuing old grievances. Orla asked what Fischer offered to the Family, and Fischer said that they had kept the Paperfold Academy to protect their members and this was the best ending he could come up with. Orla refused to return to the Nightingale Family, but Fischer promised that he would continue Joey's will of turning this desolate wasteland into Dreamjoy, into a home that brings happiness to all. Orla scorned Fischer's proclamations, yet he yearned for the day when Fischer's words come to fruition. When the Watchmaker realized that Gopher Wood had changed, he returned to the Dreamflux Reef. Orla joined him and started to revamp the entire neighborhood. After a long time passed, Orla's body was unable to withstand the test of time, so Gallagher made a new body for him \u2014 a sky-blue Origami Bird (Dr. Blues) that the Watchmaker painted as a portrait for the Dreamweaver. However, the prolonged wait has taken its toll. His mind and memories can no longer endure the wait. He sees that the Origami Dreamweavers have fulfilled their promise, but he cannot accept a Dreamscape without them. He believes that there's no reason for him to hold on, and his ending will be determined by the Trailblazer's choice in \"Dream Song\". Regardless of the Trailblazer's choice, the Origami Birds Lady Vermilion, Young Master Gold, Boss Red and Verdant Manager will arrive in the Dreamflux Reef and unite with Dr. Blues at the end of \"Dream Song\". If the player has completed \"Dream Song\" before starting the extra of Origami Animator in \"\", an extra option will become available to record Dr. Blues' story in \"Origami Bird's Extras\" of the readable \"Dreamjoy Memoir Extras\"."}

Just like their other early works, this painting has yet to receive the acclaim and praise it deserves to this day because it has not yet showcased the artist's unique dreamy kaleidoscopic style. I wish to express my deepest regret for this. Let us first consider the painting itself: Beneath a vast and brilliant starry sky, a black lighthouse symbolizing human civilization and order looks frail and insignificant \u2014 like a small boat drifting in a boundless ocean. All it would take is a single storm or a lone tidal wave to completely wipe any trace of its existence from the face of the earth. And the composition of this image uses exaggerated lines that are perpetually flowing like a spiral. These lines devour everything like frothing waves, spinning, agitating, and upheaving, constructing everything while deconstructing everything. As for technique, the artist's brushwork at this time was still a little underdeveloped, with a still immature palette. And compared to the dreamy style of later works, it is obviously too \"conservative and photo-realistic.\" However, from this painting, we can easily glimpse into the artist's reflections on \"people\" and \"the world.\" \"When we look up to the stars, what are we looking at?\" Every time we look up and gaze out at the vast and inscrutable universe, we are inevitably faced with our own insignificance. Humans \u2014 or rather, all civilizations of intelligent life \u2014 are nothing more than a fleeting and fragile candle flame before the unfathomable and mysterious might of nature. However, in this painting, all phenomena in the world \u2014 be it the eternal night sky, the boundless universe, the insignificant lighthouse symbolizing humanity, or the shaft of light beamed out from that lighthouse \u2014 are fundamentally just twisted lines randomly doodled by Imaginary Law. We come from the stars, and are no different to space dust. Everything in this world is ultimately meaningless. So, in this cold and empty tone, what answer has our painter given us? Take a look at the mysterious violet tones dotted into the indigo night sky. The constellations are giving off these gentle pale yellow lights. These lights contrast and harmonize with the flame in the lighthouse, so we feel the restless joy of time passing, but also warmth ignited in this cold long night. Thanks to these colors, those messy and restless lines no longer look cold and ruthless because they are faithful to nature. They still flow \u2014 looping back and forth, never stopping \u2014 but they emanate a gentle halo due to having been stained by the warmth of human souls, bringing a touch of life to the vast and empty night sky. Even if reality is nothing more than a dream... Even if the universe was not created for humanity... We still need to pursue the sky that belongs exclusively to ourselves \u2014 be it in a painting, or in our dreams. \"Coastline\": Metamorphosis &amp; Rebirth. 03. \"Coastline\": Metamorphosis &amp; Rebirth Author: Louis Rice In this edition, we will briefly critique the painter's breakout masterpiece: \"Coastline\". As an important messenger leading the painter into the public eye, the brushstroke techniques in this painting are more mature, and the painter's unique dreamy style has basically taken shape. Numerous interpretations of this piece have been offered up by art critics and academics. Those famed works are familiar to all, so I won't repeat them here. Rather, this author shall continue on the same train of thought as before: An analysis of the artist starting with the work. I trust that old friends already familiar with me also understand my methods of analysis, but due to the artist's popularity, these essays have recently attracted some attention and following. Because of this, I will share with new readers an outline of my line of thinking at the start of each chapter. There is a general consensus in academic circles that artworks cannot be equated with their creators. This is a concept verified by countless cultures over the centuries and seems to be an immutable truth. But this author believes that so-called works are ultimately no more than the product of splicing fragments from the creator's subconscious mind \u2014 just like dreams and hallucinations which often reflect in detail the deepest desires of the heart, which even the creator remains unaware. And the more you understand the creator themselves \u2014 the environment in which they grew up and their life experiences \u2014 the more accurate this process of inference will be. Therefore, on this basis, we will briefly review the topic of the first two notes: In \"Night of the Majestic Cosmos\", we can clearly see the artist's love for art and beauty, the strong desire for freedom, and their reflection and love for humanity. And in the second painting, the \"Death of Robin\", the artist instead portrays a severely formulaic and solemn yet disheveled funeral to express their weariness and displeasure at the tediousness of boring reality. Bearing this premise in mind, we may then turn our focus to this famous \"Coastline\". The background of the entire painting is composed of a triad of beach, ocean, and sky. Their borders echo each other diagonally across the canvas between top-left and bottom-right in the shape of the golden ratio. At the same time, from the beach in the bottom-left to the sky in the top-right, spans an arc comprising four clear themes strung together: a molted black snake skin, a white soaring bird, a golden cloud, and a crimson sun. Based on this author's interpretation, the beach, ocean, and sky respectively represent the material world, the mental world, and aesthetics itself. While the molted snake skin, the soaring bird, cloud, and sun represent the inner ideals of the artist. Burdens of life lie abandoned like a molted old snake skin, while the artist reborn is like a bird freed from the shackles of earth, rushing toward those brilliant clouds symbolizing freedom and spirituality. And the sun, high in its zenith, is the manifestation and embodiment of truth, goodness, and beauty \u2014 the goal and desire which the artist eternally longs for. The artist also makes creative use of color and line. The brushwork for the beach in the painting is solemn and forlorn, while the undulating ocean uses thick and heavy brushes, and the sky uses graceful and light lines. The colors of the four themes are black, white, yellow, and red which correspond to the, albedo,, and processes in alchemy. Thus, three dimensions are used to symbolize the metamorphosis and rebirth of the artist. Everyone knows that \"Coastline\" was a huge turning point in the artist's life. This thick and heavy work could perhaps be understood as the painter putting everything on the line in coming to Penacony, or it could be understood as the painter being a precocious dark horse that rose up through a single masterpiece. However, in this author's estimation, this point had already been revealed in the artist's work itself \u2014 even before this painting was made. \"Paradise on Earth\": When Dreamscape Overlooks Reality. 04. \"Paradise on Earth\": When Dreamscape Overlooks Reality Author: Louis Rice In this issue, we are appreciating the artist's signature work: \"Paradise on Earth\". This painting represents the complete maturity of the artist's style, establishing them as the unparalleled icon of the pure reductionist school of art. However, before formally discussing this work, please allow me to share a piece of good news: After reading the previous issue, the artist actually replied to my comments to express appreciation and endorsement for my series of analyses! At the time of writing this issue, we have exchanged letters several times. The artist's words are simple, yet reflect a peaceful elegance and tolerance between the lines. After a simple exchange of ideas with the artist, I have grown to admire them even more. So, I have decided forthwith to pick myself up and take leave for Penacony as soon as this issue has been penned, such that I might witness the stunning appearance of this great artist. Let us put aside such idle talk and turn our attention back to this incomparable masterpiece. Every time I gaze at this work, I always find myself subconsciously slipping into the painter's mental world, and it is undoubtedly an extraordinarily wonderful process: When first beholding this painting, the viewer can only glimpse a soft, misty halation like clouds of mist. These halos then shift and change, evolving into a mouth made of rubies and pearls, an eye carved from gold, and gorgeous crystal tears flowing from the eye. Starting at the corners of the eye, those teardrops march in formation to form contours and vortices \u2014 together with the eyes and the mouth \u2014 all creating a twisted, bizarre human shape out of the void. But then, amid this fuzzy yet dazzling halo, these condensed images shatter with a bang. And so we see the gold dim and the gemstones bleed, and we hear the pearl wail and the crystals crack... These delicate creations are now filled with searing pain, as though trapped within a cruel nightmare of shadowy terror from which they can never awaken. Meanwhile, we are startled awake by these uncanny dream fragments, falling headfirst back into reality \u2014 a cruel nightmare of shadowy terror from which we can never awaken. Here, the artist has shown us an abstract yet very real nightmare. By using a light and splendid palette, she gives those vague concepts and real desires a tangible shape \u2014 before ruthlessly smashing them to pieces: Who would have thought that a fleeting halo symbolizing creativity would sink into vulgar luxury? The greedy mouth built by banality gnaws at the primal serenity, bedecked with glittering jewels yet horrifying and ferocious. Those once-clear eyes corrupt into gold by vulgar contamination, and even the flowing tears are unavoidably dried and congealed into dazzling crystals. Where, then, does this plague of ostentation come from? Thriving Penacony, rapturous Penacony \u2014 You bring humans dreams and entertainment, yet breed all sin under your cover. Song, dance, wine, and gambles fill up people's bodies and simultaneously drain their souls. So, then, how many have drowned so far in that mirage and intangible dream, only to become a joyous and bloated cadaver? As for this invisible spiritual disaster, the artist keenly takes in the entire scene at once and performs deep reflections. She smashes them one-by-one \u2014 Giving up perspective, abandoning logic, dissolving boundaries \u2014 the artist uses a bright, light color palette to refine, recreate, and brutally shatter this nightmare of vain luxury. This is a fierce duel between destruction and re-creation with arrogance hidden among the serenity. The artist uses it to complete her own pilgrimage \u2014 a journey home for the pure of soul. And when we peer through these crazed appearances into the soul of the artist \u2014 one that's delicate yet wild, aloof yet scorching \u2014 then our souls, too, shall quiver akin to hearing the first bolt in a thunderstorm. The author remains curious: What kind of life experiences formed such astonishing genius? And now, I will personally visit the residence of this great artist to seek out an answer. From here on out, I, too, will be embarking on a pilgrimage of my own."}

Adler's Research Report on Ghost Stories (I). Rowdy Security Door During one Amber Era, Herta Space Station welcomed a fateful researcher. He quietly made a vow to devote the rest of his life's effort on the space station to the pursuit of unique scientific research results. Unfortunately, the \"rest of his life\" turned out to be longer than expected, perhaps even amounting to eternity. We know not what sort of experimental accident he faced at the time, but we can confirm that this \"accident\" was a necessary prerequisite for the story that follows. To deduce past events, you might need to use a little imagination \u2014 Perhaps it was a Curio capable of \"mental projection,\" or perhaps the project he was working on was itself related to the topic of \"mental projection.\" He pushed the button with anticipation, thinking that the data he had dreamed of would appear on the screen, but what he did not expect was the beginning of a tragedy. The Security Department records show that among the accidents that have occurred in the space station, there have many deaths of researchers, but not once has there been a clear record of a researcher \"disappearing into thin air.\" But his body did, in fact, disappear, and no one knows where he went. Moreover, no one had any records of his experience. Perhaps to this day, a shadow of it still remains in the dust of the space station. What a cruel twist of fate. He completed the final step of the experiment by himself \u2014 his mind was completely projected into an object. Just imagine, what kind of experience would it be if you could only \"observe\" what's happening in front of you, but couldn't interact with it or act in line with your own thoughts? The answer: It's torture! The mind is trapped in a \"prison,\" but what do the thoughts represent? What kind of receptacle can carry formless thoughts? Nobody knows the answer. However, this casts a shadow over the space station. Who would like to have a cup filled with a human's negative thoughts instead of piping hot coffee? A researcher responded that he had heard strange noises near the security door of the department. He described the sound as a \"shrill incessant wailing,\" like the cries of some strange creature. My assistant and I quickly completed the interview and investigation, and visited the mysterious and rowdy security door again. However, the situation was regrettable for everyone there. We did not find any suspicious phenomenon, nor any evidence that could support the theory of \"mental projection.\" Under the relentless in-depth investigation of my assistant and I, we finally found a lone Wubbaboo near the security door, who kept making \"woo woo\" sounds. However, one of the researchers, in their exhaustion, mistook this for crying, which eventually led to this wild goose chase. \"The author hereby requests: Ghost stories need to be debunked, and work needs to be moderated!

Due to the request of the contributor, it is inconvenient to disclose the specific details. The only thing that can be revealed is that this is a letter from an \"eyewitness\" of the ghost story, and the experience of the story is also novel, never-seen-before content. By interviewing the eyewitness, my assistant and I pieced together the full picture of the ghost story: If you press the flush button of the mysterious toilet that suddenly appears at the end of the corridor, you will lose consciousness and be \"taken\" to a mysterious room... Since my assistant and I were unable to find the mysterious toilet, it was impossible to explain the mechanism of bodily transportation. But we did visit that mysterious room. The moment when I opened the door, I was actually full of fear and apprehension: Could it be a trap? Or maybe it was a place for some of the space station's under-the-table activities? Alas, in order to reveal the truth to my friends and readers, I went on in. It turned out that it was just an ordinary room, and there was a researcher from the Department of Implement Arts, who was trying to track down the \"toilet.\" Rather, its correct name was \"Experiment 13\"... After patiently talking with the researcher, the full story was uncovered \u2014 the mysterious \"toilet\" was a Curio borrowed by the Department of Implement Arts for a confidential experiment, code-named \"Experiment 13.\" Due to a mistake by the researcher in the experiment, Experiment 13 caused all kinds of rumors throughout the space station. But is that the whole truth behind the researcher's explanation? Or is it some kind of conspiracy? Or maybe... the answer is left to you to write in the comments section!

Text. Dear Citizens, It's human nature to love animals. Hoping animals can be freed comes from a sense of compassion. An old Xianzhou saying goes, \"A nobleman steers clear of the kitchen.\" An ancient classic from the Primeval Imperium Age, \"Signs of the Netherealm\", tells of a sage imploring a hunter to release his quarry. Examples would be too numerous to list, all of which demonstrate the traditional virtue of the Xianzhou natives in caring for all living things. However, we must be careful with how we care for animals. The illegal release of animals back into their natural environs may seem like a meritorious deed, but it actually bears several serious consequences. In March last year, a criminal suspect Mr. Chai (461 years old) smuggled twenty Nosewalkers he'd purchased into the Ever-Hunt Plains with the intent of release into nature. Nosewalkers, originated from the planet Hyai'i, have recently been introduced aboard the Xianzhou as a popular alien pet. But this seemingly cute, docile, and harmless pet actually has a dark side: Its size expands with that of its surrounding living space. When the Cloud Knights' hunting squad located the first of the nosewalkers, the largest had already grown to the size of two starskiffs. Based on data published by the Hyai'i Federal Bureau of Biology and Medicine, the largest nosewalker ever recorded is half the size of the Luofu. Can you imagine the devastating consequences were Mr. Chai to release one of these animals onto the Ever-Hunt Plains? Or stepping back a mile, even if the animal itself isn't harmful, is there any way we can be sure of any unforeseen genetic reactions? We cannot. Upon arrest, Mr. Chai pled that he was acting in good faith. We believe that most of these animal releases are well-meaning, but it's precisely this kind of goodwill that could bring immeasurable losses to the Xianzhou. There is also a rumor circulating around the city that only alien species released in Xianzhou are harmful, and the release of Xianzhou-native animals cannot cause any harm. This idea could not be further from the truth. In July, a criminal suspect Mr. Ling (242 years old) bought schools and schools of lightfish at the farmers' markets, and together with some other animal liberation activists released the fish without authority into the seas at Scalegorge Waterscape. I trust that anyone with a hint of common sense can immediately realize how ignorant and cruel an act it is to release large volumes of carnivorous fish into the Scalegorge Waterscape waters. Therefore, despite the actions of Mr. Ling and his conspirators bearing out no serious repercussions, they must still be punished to the full extent of the law to serve as an example to others. The Realm-Keeping Commission reiterates to all citizens: Only professionals are qualified to release animals (officially termed \"reintroduction into the wild\"), and any private release of animals is illegal \u2014 possibly even criminal! We hope all citizens understand: Please care for animals rationally and scientifically, because ignorant kindness is often more dangerous than rational malice.

By the time the people in Penacony raised their heads from their shelter, the countless Voidrangers had been swallowed up into the iridescent colors. Since then, the forces of Destruction have never dared to step onto the Planet of Festivities. "}

Aha is one of the few Aeons closer to mortals, inspiring THEIR believers to delight in the joys of life.

Related Entry \u2014 The Elation ...The Elation, seriously? I don't feel elated when I think about Aha. All I feel is chaos. No other Aeon is as much of a headache as Aha. Aha has no sense of self-consciousness, is utterly unpredictable, does everything on a whim, and plays mortals and the universe like a fiddle. According to poor old Elias Salas' records, Aha once turned a Noblesse Worm into THEIR Emanator and granted the worm fathomless intelligence, just to see if Noblesse Worms could enter the Genius Society \u2014 The answer was no. For this pointless experiment, the Elation gave the entirety of THEIR Path's power to a worm that doesn't even have a fully developed brain, and then just discarded the creature once it had outlived its purpose. Without the Aeon's blessing, the worm died instantly and tragically. I don't know why Elias Salas recorded this in such great detail. Maybe he was shocked by this...? Dev Log2. Related Entry \u2014 The Elation ...It'd be one thing if THEY only reveled in toying with mortals. The worst thing about this monster named Aha is that THEY won't even spare other Aeons as long as there's fun to be had. I obtained a large amount of valuable info from the Astral Express' data bank after I got to know the Express crew, including intel on close encounters between many Aeons such as Qlipoth, Terminus, Ena, and Xipe. Unsurprisingly, Aha was also involved in these interactions between Aeons, but in a way that far exceeded my imagination \u2014 Aha wanted to trick Akivili and the Nameless, so Aha shapeshifted into a human and laid low on Akivili's Express for more than a year, then finally got the opportunity and blew up half the Express and an entire planet. If I were Akivili, I'd have wanted to kill Aha. Pity I'm not an Aeon, and I can never figure out what THEY were thinking... Dev Log3. Related Entry \u2014 The Elation ...Aha, no way! THEY are really eager to watch the universe burn \u2014 this one is bound to pour more fuel on the fire. Things have taken a turn for the worse since the laughter of the Elation resounded in the universe. How can three Aeons participate in a crusade against the Propagation in the same Amber Era? It's terrifying even to think about. No one knew what Aha had done. After all, the Masked Fools' praises are not to be trusted. The story of that gondola was recorded in the data bank. But come to think of it, how could a mortal possibly influence a god? Seriously, right now, the most important thing is that Screwllum and I are already getting a headache \u2014 how can we stop the simulated Aha from reversely affecting the Simulated Universe?"}

It has the power to shape life and subdue death at will. The ancestors of the Luofu people consumed the fruits of the Ambrosial Arbor and gained immortality, though this soon became a curse rather than a blessing. Those who gained immortality were inflicted with Mara, went insane, and turned into beasts. Later, the Luofu came under the protection of the Aeon Lan, who shattered the tree, leaving it as a stump. History. During the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium \u2014 Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war broke out as a result. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation were released to counter the invasion \u2014 including the Reignbow who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow Arbiter shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu. The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrating Muldrasil, and severing the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Imbibitor Lunae was bound to watch over the Ambrosial Arbor. To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, high elder of the Luofu at the time, made the decision to flood Scalegorge Waterscape with the waters of the ancient sea in order to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor. Starskiff seeds were developed from the Ambrosial Arbor. In the Year 7379 Star Calendar, Imbibitor Lunae Dan Feng would go on to commit a great crime and sin by invoking the Transmutation Arcanum, embracing immorality and breaking the ban, thieving immortality and inciting riot. Dan Feng made changes to the Transmutation Arcanum; allowing other species to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara, giving the Vidyadhara the possibility of replenishing their population and created a draconic abomination that wreaked great destruction on Scalegorge Waterscape, which the remaining members of the Quintet were forced to put down, resulting in damage to the seals. The creation of Bailu, her instatement as Dan Feng's successor as High Elder, and the dragon heart going missing were also a result of this incident. The Cloud Knights joined forces with the Vidyadhara Preceptors to assault him, Dan Feng was captured and his punishment was carried out; he went through hatching rebirth and his subsequent incarnation was held in the Shackling Prison for a period of time before being exiled from the Luofu, leaving the Ambrosial Arbor unguarded for over 700 years. Sometime around the Year 8100 Star Calendar, amidst the Stellaron Crisis, the Ambrosial Arbor was revived using the power of a Stellaron that was smuggled aboard the Luofu. The events were masterminded by Lord Ravager Phantylia who intended to dismantle the Xianzhou from within, and used the power of the Arbor to create a new body for herself. General Jing Yuan and the Astral Express Crew headed into Scalegorge Waterscape to confront Phantylia after Dan Heng, Dan Feng's reincarnation, undid the already weakened seals in Dragon Palace. At the roots of the Arbor, they fought a tough battle, but eventually defeated the Lord Ravager. Sometime afterward, Dan Heng would meet with High Elder Bailu at Dragonvista Rainhall in order to help repair the seals to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor in the Lunarescent Depths, where they discover that Bailu had inherited Dan Feng's healing and restorative abilities while Dan Heng did not."}

To the Esteemed Six Charioteers of the Luofu: With the great calamity quelled, the voracious enemy subdued, and the treacherous rebels expelled, the Luofu has once again returned to peace. What a joyous day this is. My people have suffered much in this crisis. The wounded include 12 Preceptors, 253 Pearlkeepers, and 116 alchemists and healers. There are 1285 who have completely perished in this disaster, and over 3000 are still missing. While we lament these losses, we dared not forget our duty. Since the time of the High Elder Yubie, the Vidyadhara of the Luofu have shouldered the duty of keeping watch over the Ambrosial Arbor. However, when the disaster struck and the seals were loosened, all the elites of my people could not return it to its previous form. Therefore, we beseech the Six Charioteers to ask the Ten-Lords Commission to return the sinner Dan Feng to us, let him restore the seals, and mete out his punishment at a later time. Yours respectfully, Suguang, Vidyadhara Preceptor \"\"General, the Vidyadhara's letter of appeal is here\" \u2014 Qingzu.\" \"They gave this to the Six Charioteers and not to the Ten-Lords Commission, probably knowing that the Commission would never reply to them, thus deciding to appeal to the Six Charioteers instead. I didn't anticipate my first problem as the general would be something completely unrelated to military affairs...\" (II). To the Esteemed General Jing Yuan I was alarmed to learn that you had signed an exile order to permanently cast out the sinner Dan Feng from the Luofu. Wherefore do you place the reputation of the Luofu's Vidyadhara with this order, general? According to the deal between the Alliance and Caelorum Venti of the Yaoqing, the sinner Dan Feng was to be spared from death and instead suffer the punishment of molting rebirth. After that, according to Vidyadhara customs, Dan Feng should have been regarded as a new being and his sins forgiven. However, the Ten-Lords Commission detained him under the guise of educating the young man, while keeping him prisoner in truth. We have endured this for so long due to the truly astounding nature of his sin. Were he not to suffer for some days within the Shackling Prison, the multitudes of Luofu residents would not be appeased in their anger. However, general, you have arbitrarily terminated his sentence and decided to exile Dan Feng. Was this a consensus reached after a discussion with the Six Charioteers? And was this sent to the marshal to be confirmed? If your action stemmed from your past friendship with Dan Feng, then we regret to inform you that we cannot accept such a sentimental gesture. Us Preceptors will appeal to the Alliance and inform the other four High Elders, and we will seek to have you retract this order. Yours respectfully, Shaoying, Vidyadhara Preceptor \"\"The Vidyadhara handed us thousands of letters of appeal during the past few centuries... and this one has the harshest wording. They are running out of patience.\" \u2014 Qingzu\" \"The exile was approved by the Ten-Lords Commission. Since Dan Feng had already been reborn and his sins are to be forgotten, why won't the Preceptors allow him to leave this troubled place...? Interesting.\" "}

Text. Small Talk in Exalting Sanctum: Lifestyle Section 13 November, 10th Year of the Star Calendar Author: Huai Min An Evening Journey Through Exalting Sanctum On the twelfth of October at the Sleepless Earl, I met my old friend from the Artisanship Commission, whom I had not seen in two or three centuries. It was odd. I recall that I had a minor disagreement with him and we both vowed to never speak again, yet I instantly let go of all our past grievances when I heard him call out for me in the Sleepless Earl... Little did I imagine that we would sit at the same table and drink tea together again after a few centuries. It seems the Sleepless Earl is just the kind of place where you always have surprise encounters. We drank pot after pot of Whale-Tide Spring and called for more hot water. As the tea thinned in its aroma, the daylight started to dim. My friend was assigned to manage ships and equipment in the Cloud Knights and must return to his post according to regulations, and we parted ways unwillingly after exchanging contact details. As I walked below the lanterns on the way home, I recalled the many memories I shared with my friend. I remembered that I passed the flying test when we were learning how to fly ships at the Sky-Soaring Seas, but my friend didn't. I remembered we did part-time jobs at All Under One Roof for a long time just to get enough money to buy the latest Halcyon jade abacus... We were once the closest of friends, yet we didn't talk for centuries because of some disagreement I can't even remember. If my friend and I were not living in the Xianzhou, we might have passed away before we even hit a hundred years old and would have never met again. That would be far too unfortunate. Maybe I drank too much tea and was too excited \u2014 I couldn't sleep even though I laid in bed for a long time, and I decided to take an evening walk. The moon in the delve today was clearer than that of days before and would be a pity to miss. It would be best enjoyed with someone else. Luckily, my student was also awake, and I brought him to take an evening walk with me. Past the Garden of Leisure and deep in the grass was the ruin of a garden complex built in the old style. It was hidden deep in the grass and yet to be cleaned out. The masonry reflected a gentle white light under the caresses of the moon. A pseudo-ancient stone lion was lying sideways on the grass, napping sweetly in the open as if it was slowly sinking into a pond of moonlight... My student and I held our breath, terrified of possibly waking it. The other ruins here included stone pillars with lotus capitals and water basins etched with cloud patterns. Unfortunately, there was no complete garden left anymore. Young artists want to revive the old style as \"fashion\" and build old things every once in a while. I believe they, just like me, are terrified of the endless expanse of time. They always want to remember the past more intensely to prevent the bygone days from being diluted, but all this effort will prove to be futile before time. The mossy masonry deep in the grass seemed to be breathing. A distant voice was saying: \"Don't try to understand it. For tonight, you need only to feel.\" I, therefore, stopped thinking too much. During that time, my student had already fallen asleep on his feet. Pedestrians passed the Verdurous Garden every day in the company of moonlight and broken rocks, only this time we have folks of leisure such as my student and I."}
{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=18833","text":"An Exchange Diary Between Pilots An Exchange Diary Between Pilots is a readable from The Xianzhou Luofu obtained after completing the Companion Mission \"For I Have Touched the Sky\". Yukong's Exchange Diary. Caiyi, we are going to be partners! We've known each other for so long, but when we first knew each other racing starskiffs illegally in the city, we were rivals! Now that we're asked to work together and have each other's back, I'm really not used to it. Naturally, I'm not used to having to look after someone who lost against me, but an order's an order, heh. I jest. I really look forward to flying with you. I don't know when we would receive a combat mission. I don't know what you think about our situation, but I think we both have considerable skills, and having to sit still and not fight enemies in the front lines, it's stifling. Those Denizens of Abundance often raid the border and occasionally there are reports of them harming innocent planets. Every time I hear these news, I feel an overwhelming sense of anger... but now, things are different. After a while, we'll be able to show them what we're made of on our fighter jets. Honestly though, I'm pretty satisfied with my life right now. After all... just between you and me, what I really wanted was never the righteous cause of ridding demonic activities. What attracts me is just the act of flying itself. Look, flying out in the universe outside of the delves is entirely different from racing starskiffs that we're so used to... There is nothing to anchor us in space, there's not even a distinction between up and down. Our fighter jets would be hung in space by their lonesome selves like ships sailing in the middle of the ocean. By then, there is no one else you can rely on but your own skills and your jet. Some may call this \"feeling lonely,\" but I prefer to call it freedom. To me, the ability to fly in space is good enough. And if I have share this sweet freedom with you, that's even better. Caiyi, I don't know what to say to console you. You're always like this, no matter what terrible things happened to you, you would act strong, as if you don't need anyone to care for you, and you have terrible timing for jokes. But we have been together for over a hundred years and I think we understand each other very well. You once said that if something is unpleasant for me, it would also be uncomfortable for you. I actually feel the same way, too. Right now, my heart feels like it's being gouged out with a blunt, rusted knife. I can't imagine the amount of hurt and pain you're going through. It's funny, I've never shown Guangyuan my good side. Every time you leave me alone to go on a mission with him, I feel uncomfortable. Especially when I see you two flirting and getting along as if you're inseparable, I can't help but want to glare at him with disdain. But Guangyuan is a good person. No matter how rude I was to him, he was always kind to me. Thinking back on it now, I realize I'm just really bad at appreciating people. Ah... he's really amazing. He managed to hold off several dozen enemy ships with only two people. This isn't something that can be done with just courage and resolve, it also requires exceptional skills and extraordinary talent. I can imagine what it was like in his final moments, how his annoyingly handsome face must have shown such determination and focus. I guess that's why you fell in love with him in the first place. I can imagine how proud he must've felt in that moment. He must've had no fear or hopelessness, only pride. So you shouldn't be sad. You should be proud of him. We all should. Caiyi, I've been having a lot of negative emotions recently that I cannot express to other fighters on the front line. Since you're recuperating in the rear, I'll just dump them on you. Although it seems I'm a bit slow to say such words now, it was only recently that I realized that I am actually in the midst of such a cruel war. Space combat is different from ground combat. Although both involve life and death in an instant, it is rare to see severed limbs and broken bodies in space, which led me to misjudge the brutality of this war. It wasn't until recently, as the situation on the front lines worsened, that the bloody reality gently but indisputably presented itself before me. Someone might sit beside you for a meal today and be missing in action tomorrow. A new soldier earning praise and honor today might disappear the next. The captain I fought with today might not be found tomorrow. The ground troops that exchanged encouragement with me today might be eliminated the next. At this point, I'm wary of building personal connections with anyone here. Perhaps that person would perish, or I might perish, or we might both perish in the day to come. I thought I have experienced enough to feel numb, but bad news kept coming in waves every single day. However, I don't regret this at all. Whenever the pain comes, the feeling that becoming a fighter pilot is the best choice I have made in my life will follow. If I weren't a fighter pilot, I can only endure this pain in silent. But I am, I can fly, I can battle. and I can attempt to destroy the source of my pain. Because I am a fighter pilot, I have things that I can do, realities that I can change. P.S.: Don't use the names Guangyuan came up with, they're terrible! Choosing a name is a big decision the child has to bear with for a lifetime! Use my suggestion instead, it's something I picked with after diligently going through several collections worth of poetry. Caiyi, I have a lot to tell you. So many things. After your death, they wanted to honor me with a medal. Truthfully, I find that laughable. Based on common logic, no one would award survivors medals to praise their fortuitous survival. But no, not the Sky-Faring Commission. They gave me a medal, called me a hero pilot, and the only reason for it is because of my luck to remain alive in that calamitous battle. If you had been as lucky as me, we could've gotten the medals together. After the medal ceremony, we could've gone to Aurum Alley, have a few drinks, and laugh at the absurdity of it all. It's a shame, luck is not on your side. We don't have that chance anymore. I suddenly feel nostalgic. I remembered all the time we had steering our starskiffs across the Luofu sky. We were so carefree. There were no threats to our lives, and we didn't have to bear the calling of The Hunt. The entirety of the sky within the delve was ours - yours and mine. Above us was the delve's flashing dome ceiling, and below us were the bustling lights of ten thousand homes. Oh, and behind us, the Realm-Keeping Commission officers who just won't stop chasing us. That was a time of insouciance, how I wish we could stay in that time forever. Caiyi's Exchange Diary. Yukong, I'm happy to have a chance to fight side-by-side with you. When the pair assignment was sent out, I was so nervous that I didn't dare to open and check it, fearing that we wouldn't be paired up. It's not like I can't bear to part with you, but I was worried to leave you with the others with your fiery temperament. When you actually get to the battlefield, don't act recklessly like you do now, always charging in with hotheadedness. Before taking action, think more about the consequences. But it's okay, I don't want to talk about this anymore, or you'll accuse me of nagging like an old crone again. In any case, we need to work together, using our individual strengths to create our own legends in the vast sky. I look forward to fighting in the vast skies with you, so much so that I'm finding it hard to fall asleep. Yukong, don't cry. There is no need to be sad. My husband was the one who died, but you're crying more than I am. After so many years of fighting, you're still so emotional. I'm envious. Being a fighter pilot has always been a harrowing decision. Since we chose this path, we have to be mentally prepared. What's important is not whether we can survive by luck, but whether we can live up to the value of a pilot's life. Guangyuan and his partner managed to keep an entire borisin fleet at bay. They were heroes. To me, that is enough. I've heard it said that the greatest happiness in life is being able to choose how you die. From this perspective, to fight for the Xianzhou Alliance... no, for the people of the entire galaxy, to die on the battlefield after a lifetime of military service, Guangyuan is probably happy. Of course, you better not have this kind of happiness, just live another two hundred years, behave, and then die of old age for me. Yukong, it's been a long time. I'm still on my maternity leave in the rear. Everything is fine. With the stalemate happening right now, you must be very busy. But when you have the chance, please take a moment to write an exchange diary entry for me, so that I can know you are still safe... and also, I have a mountain of things I want to talk to you about. Firstly, an announcement. I've already decided on a name for our child. Guangyuan has talked about this before. If it's a boy, name him Dragon, and if it's a girl. name her Phoenix. But this man's literary sense is as good as the monkeys in the Ever-Hunt Plains. No matter how much we should prioritize the wishes of my late husband, I cannot let his wants ruin my child's life. So after much pondering, I've decided to go with your suggestion and name her Qingni - the colors of dawn. \"The moonlit camp opens to a garden of archery, frosty banners brush the colors of dawn.\" How rare, you made the time and effort to look through poems and allegories. I thought you only cared about fighter jets. Don't miss me too much. After taking a few months of break and settling Qingni down, I will be back in action ASAP. Qingni is still so young, and I need to leave her to fight a war... How should I say this, I'm such an irresponsible mother. I am well aware. The situation on the front line doesn't look so good. The borisin keeps breaking our ranks. All the media outlets are trying to control the spread of panic and fear, but the Luofu is shrouded with a veil of uneasiness. However, I believe the Xianzhou Alliance will win. I believe that warriors like you and me will repel those Denizens of Abundance to whence they come. I look forward to fighting beside you once more. Yukong, we will be heading toward a cruel battlefield tomorrow. So tonight, there are some things I must entrust to you. (This may be somewhat ominous, but there's no help for it. Who made it so that we've never entrusted these things to each other before?) If you lived and I didn't, please take care of Qingni like you would your own daughter. I know you will. I will entrust you with all my savings, please use that as living expenses for Qingni. No matter what kind of person Qingni wants to become, please support her fully. Merchant, poet, street performer, anything except a jet fighter. Please allow me to make a vow with you: Do not let Qingni become a jet fighter. When we enlisted, you wrote in this diary: \"Our fighter jets would be hung in space by their lonesome selves like ships sailing in the middle of the ocean.\" \"...Some may call this 'feeling lonely,' but I prefer to call it freedom.\" I really loved this segment, because I thought the same. But that's enough. Loneliness or freedom, we've already tasted it all. Promise me, don't let that child touch the sky."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=17835","text":"An Overview of the Faith Crises in the Xianzhou Alliance An Overview of the Faith Crises in the Xianzhou Alliance is a 4-part readable found aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Part I. According to the Xianzhou legend, a hero and the Flint Emperor joined forces to fire a Lux Arrow to destroy the Muldrasil of wingweavers. Afterward, the hero vanished into the unknown until they ascended to become the Reignbow Arbiter. They then returned and took to protecting Xianzhou till the present. This incident is quite peculiar if we look at it now. For Xianzhou citizens who have an average lifespan of 800 years, the war took place only four generations ago, and it can even be considered modern history. Still, the myth of fire deification, which was never proven, is a historical event known by most Xianzhou citizens. For a more thorough discussion about this matter, we must talk about the Crisis of Belief that spanned from Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar. First and foremost, one thing is certain: The title of \"Reignbow Arbiter\" came about earlier than the official appearance of The Hunt as an Aeon. After the hero destroyed the Muldrasil with the Flint Emperor, \"Reignbow Arbiter\" became their title. Their original name thus was tabooed and never mentioned in any writings. Not long after the hero's \"sacrifice,\" pandemonium broke out because of the Null. The little remaining faith the Xianzhou people had in Yaoshi wavered because of the mara-struck. They had to decide whose Path to follow after giving up on the Aeon they once believed in. The IPC contacted the Alliance in the first millennium of the Alliance's voyage. Their Preservation beliefs gradually influenced the Xianzhou people. From the way they named the Aeon, we can see that the Reignbow Arbiter is the only Arbiter besides the Firmamend Arbiter. After Merciful Medicus turned into the Plagues Author, many of Xianzhou's peoples decided to follow the Path of Qlipoth, the god of the skywall. They became known as the Firmamend Sect. During the 600 years of the Crisis of Belief, the Firmamend Arbiter was once the pillar of the Xianzhou Alliance's beliefs. Although Xianzhou people's faiths have changed drastically by the present, traces of the Firmamend Arbiter can still be seen in the many names of places and buildings leftover from that bygone era, such as the Yaoqing's Amber Avenue, the Luofu's Skywall Delve, and the Zhuming's Firmamend Temple. Among the structures, the two most magnificent ones are the Firmamend Temple built by the IPC in the Zhuming and the Amber Palace in Cangcheng. The former is now an affiliated academy of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission, whereas the latter has faded away over time along with Cangcheng, leaving only some videos and a poem by an untraceable author: \"From the rails do I perceive the Celestial Hall, and upon clouds can I stride above the leagues of all. In the distance rises the apex of Firmamend high, and the skywall is parted from the peaks mountains though their nearness is nigh.\" Part II. Although the Firmamend Arbiter was once the centerpiece of faith among the intellectuals and merchants, the Aeon was one typically indifferent to the lives of mortals. Compared to that Arbiter's worldview, the people of Xianzhou leaned more toward pragmatism when it comes to their preferred spirituality. Therefore, diverse choices of new beliefs bloomed among them. Quite a number of people went against the trend and became faithfuls of the Yaoshi. They firmly believed that the behavior of the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will, and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed. These people called themselves Disciples of Sanctus Medicus (hereafter referred to as the \"Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus\" to differentiate them from modern terrorists). For a long time in history, the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were not a notorious group. They accepted skepticism with an open mind and built apothecaries to help the poor and needy. For those who had long abandoned Yaoshi beliefs, the behavior of the group was pathetic and laughable, though not particularly detestable. Here is something worth mentioning, thought the Xianzhou people spared no efforts to diminish it: The predecessor of the Cold Springs Sect, which overhauled the entire Xianzhou healthcare system and stepped onto the historical stage several millennia after the Crisis of Belief, was the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus that existed in secret for thousands of years. In recent years, a group of sorcerers wreaked havoc by impersonating the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Only then did the Cold Springs Sect publish a statement to clarify that they had abandoned the erroneous belief in the Plagues Author. Many intellectuals abandoned their old paths for good and chose to follow the Wisdomwalker on the Path of Erudition. They were called the Wisdom Sect. Back then, most Wisdom Sect members preferred to focus on academic research in their ivory towers than spending time on secular matters. Hence, their presence was not felt much during the Crisis of Belief era when the people were spoiled with a plethora of selectable beliefs. (They continued to use the term, \"the Sacrosancts,\" mostly because they attached little importance to the title of Aeons.) The Wisdom Sect still exists, although it is hardly know and only has a small group of followers left. The Wisdom Sapientia Academe in the Yuque, which dates back to 5,000 years ago, has provided a constant supply of talented technicians who believe in the Wisdomwalker to various Xianzhou commissions. Not a single Xianzhou person who believes in the Reignbow Arbiter has any issues with the arrangement. After all, to most Xianzhou people of sane and pragmatic mind, The Hunt is a righteous path to follow, not a shackle that controls people. As long as you walk the right path, the Aeon you believe in is just something that helps you achieve your goals. Part III. Besides those who believed in Aeons, some also believed in non-Aeon beings, such as the Homeward Sect that believed in the Primeval Imperium Emperor, the Flint Emperor Sect that believed in the Flint Emperor, and the Reignbow Sect that believed in Reignbow (the version of Reignbow who had not become on Aeon at that time). This sounds bizarre too. It's hard to believe there were people who believed in non-Aeon beings in an advanced civilization with a clear understanding of Aeons. The historical documents about the followers of these two factions have now become important resources in the field of religious psychology. Many monographs study the psychological mechanisms behind these beliefs, but it is not possible to include their content within the confines of this small document. Here, we will only discuss the most apparent motivation of these believers. For those of the Homeward Sect, their faith and loyalty to the Primeval Imperium Emperor was largely just a facade. Their choice of belief was not a philosophical one, but a political one. This is actually quite understandable. Although the Xianzhou people at that time had never been home, their longing to be back never waned. So, these homesick people declared, \"We should not continue our voyage alone. Instead, we should answer the call of our emperor and find our way back to our homeland.\" After Foxians joined the Xianzhou Alliance, many of them who wished to rebuild their homeland (the Verdant Sect) merged with the Homeward Sect. Till this day, they remain a political force to be reckoned with. From this incongruous merging, we can see that this style of faith stands as something akin to a slogan for the Homeward Sect (as well as the Verdant Sect). All they want is to be back in their homeland. On the other hand, those of the Flint Emperor Sect looked like they were betting their future on their beliefs. They were convinced that the Flint Emperor would one day become an Aeon, and the only thing that stood in the way of the Flint Emperor's ascendancy was the captivity of the Xianzhou people. If they followed the Flint Emperor firmly, liberated the heliobi, and helped the Flint Emperor become an Aeon, then when the Flint Emperor became the ruler of a Path, they would become the closest mortals to the Aeon and benefit from the power of the Path. To no one's surprise, this belief soon led to criminal activity, and those involved were arrested by the relevant authorities. These extremists who supported the Flint Emperor wholeheartedly eventually receded into oblivion. The only notable thing about this farce is that the Flint Emperor Sect remained undecided on the Path that the Flint Emperor would rule even until its demise. Some suggested \"Intelligence,\" some proposed \"Flame,\" and even some mentioned \"Grilling,\" which sounded like they would have control over all the grilled meat skewers in the Cosmos. Part IV. In the above paragraph, we barely touched on the Reignbow Sect's actions during the Crisis of Belief. The reason is surprisingly simple \u2014 the sect was hardly active at that time, and the people did not even regard it as a proper belief. That does not mean that the Xianzhou people had no reverence for the Reignbow. In fact, almost everyone of the Xianzhou would commemorate the Reignbow's sacrifice in appreciation of what they had done for the survival of Xianzhou. But when it came to matters of faith, few of them truly believed that a martyred hero would ascend to become an Aeon and protect the Xianzhou. Please allow me to digress and discuss something unrelated to the topic here. Nowadays, many accounts focusing on the discipline history are spreading anxiety on social media about the existence of History Fictionologists, which is highly detrimental to the education of historical knowledge. Among all rumors, the most widely circulated and devastating one is the claim that the Xianzhou Alliance Declaration has been tampered with by History Fictionologists. Most of the time, those rumor-mongers will emphasize how the Reignbow Arbiter had yet to become an Aeon when the declaration mentioned: \"From Reignbow to the Ten Lords.\" Now that you have learned about the history behind the \"Reignbow Arbiter\" title, I believe the rumor can be easily debunked. Now, back to the topic of the Reignbow Sect. During the Crisis of Belief era, a sect that sincerely believed in the Reignbow Arbiter was not of the public's favor. People preferred to ask for protection from already existing Aeons instead of a non-existing one that could only provide emotional support. Despite being marginalized, the sect did not struggle. They kept praying, anticipating the return of the hero. Following the destruction of the Denizens of Abundance's territory by the divine arrow, the people of Xianzhou came to realize that the Reignbow Arbiter truly existed. The Divination Commission, followed by the IPC, the guild, and the other sects, acknowledged the birth of a new Aeon: The Hunt. From a fringe group, the Reignbow Sect transformed into a popular sect that could compete with the Firmamend Sect almost overnight. The subsequent conflict that transpired was not a religious one, but one to determine the future path of Xianzhou. The Firmamend Sect insisted on abiding by the Firmamend Arbiter's will and was strongly against Xianzhou's involvement in the war with the Denizens of Abundance. The Reignbow Sect opined that hiding and defending is not enough to fend off the Denizens of Abundance. For the survival of the Alliance, only by following the path of The Hunt and cleansing the enemy could the future be secured. Following consecutive victorious expeditions, he numerous appearances of the Reignbow, and the joining of the Foxian and Vidyadhara, the Reignbow Sect slowly gained traction among the people. In Year 4100, the Reignbow Arbiter became the undisputed main Aeon of the Xianzhou Alliance. Just like that, the Crisis of Belief came to an end, and the era of the Reignbow Arbiter began."}

Now, please allow me to be sincere and straightforward in my words. The differences between us have existed since the beginning of our relationship. At first, I was blinded by my intense admiration and affection for you, and I willingly regarded you as an authority figure and my spiritual mentor. However, this does not justify treating your followers as mere experimental subjects. You often exert pressure on everyone around you, whether intentionally or unintentionally, causing people to subconsciously perceive themselves as inferior to you. You sit in the \"Father's\" chair, accepting unconditional admiration, flattery, and praise, as a guarantee of your unassailable authority. However, when faced with criticisms or challenges, your amiable demeanor and generosity vanish, replaced by cruelty, denunciation, and dictatorship. In your eyes, any dissent is nothing more than rebellion against one's father. Even though my intention is to further refine the valuable insights you have discovered, you accuse me of harboring \"patricidal motives\" and claim that my efforts to expand upon your doctrine are an attempt to \"undermine your unshakable fortress.\" However, isn't your obsession with authority an outward display of your pathological dependency? With all due respect, you simply derive your sense of security from the love and approval of others, and you rely on it for your emotional stability. Obviously, I am not the only \"friend\" who has distanced themselves from you due to differences in ideals. Admit it \u2014 you don't seek friends, but rather compliant children who lack independent opinions. Frankly, your \"authority\" and obstinacy now appear rather absurd in my eyes.

A man storms wildly across the pointed rooftop rafters. Within but a moment, the man is at the edge of the eaves with nothing but air beneath his steps. Suddenly, the man leaps off the roof, catching onto a Heron Express cycrane. The birdlike ingenuity mutters out a few prerecorded warnings before trying to shake him off. Finally, it stabilizes, and carries him off safely to a starskiff parked in the distance. When the Alchemy Commission guards finally reached the rooftop, the man had disappeared \u2014 leaving behind only a cricket-like shadow figure. A guard eyed the diminishing figure, before falling to the ground with tears in his eyes, trembling as he muttered: \"It's over, everything's over.\" \"Ninsa, it's not our fault.\" The officer beside him sighed aloud and then spoke self-deprecatingly, \"Notify the Ten-Lords Commission. They can fix this.\" \"Fix?\" Shouted the guard called Ninsa. \"Tell me how to fix this, Hede. He fled with a jade abacus that holds the prescriptions from the Theophany Era! Xianzhou has been hiding those secrets for centuries. Once revealed, the consequences will be unimaginable...\" Ninsa paused and, seeing his partner lost for words and his own troops even more petrified, he stood up to continue shouting: \"We didn't even get a clear view of his face! Even the Ten-Lords Commission can't help us.\" Before he could finish, a cold female voice rang out behind everyone: \"I've already memorized his face. Rest assured.\" Everyone automatically fanned out, and the woman revealed her face \u2014 a young girl with short black hair holding a chain and scepter in her hands. There was no emotion on her delicate and lovely face, and it sent chills down the spines of the troops. \"All ingenium creations are prohibited around the Elixir Research Terrace. Of course, not including me.\" The young lady said as she walked to the edge of the roof, her voice chilling to the bones. \"All cycranes responsible for deliveries are registered with the Realm-Keeping Commission. If they were modded, they can be detected very soon.\" \"How do you explain that particular one? You've seen it, right?\" Asked Ninsa. \"It may have been hijacked by some kind of bioelectric signal. That Outworlder's abilities are pretty unique, are you concerned?\" Ninsa seems to be stunned into silence by this visitor, and almost dropped to the ground once more. Like an animal with his instincts, Hede asked cautiously, \"May I ask who your Excellency is...\" \"Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission.\" And with that, the girl flipped down off the top of the roof, and instantly disappeared out of sight.

Like a porcelain doll, the girl from the Ten-Lords Commission gave chase. She had to catch up before the secret was leaked, to apprehend the criminal... \"Hey, Madam,\" called out a short Foxian female judge. \"Not even the Ten-Lords Commission could identify bioelectric signals without any evidence. This judgment seems a little arbitrary...\" \"The point is not the signal itself,\" the girl being called Madam interrupted. \"A secret prescription from the Theophany Era is hidden in the Elixir Research Terrace, and was stolen by an Outworld thief...\" \"What do you mean...?\" asked the Foxian tentatively, afraid of being remonstrated by her leader for not knowing. \"Has all items stored in the Elixir Research Terrace been advertised so widely that even Outworlders know about it? Has it become common knowledge?\" said the girl, pausing to add: \"Go and look into things there, including any previous doctors who've been fired or quit.\" \"Miss, please stop. This is the men's room...\" Before he could finish, the Vidyadhara guy guarding the door of the men's room felt a cold object on his neck. Looking down, he saw a scepter in the shape of a spear-tip. According to his own words, he was able to safely survive his first years by relying on three words alone: \"understand the times.\" So he immediately smiled and said: \"It's urgent, right? Then I won't stop you, haha.\" Then, he cut a strange pose, turned back, and smiled apologetically as he fled off down a dark alleyway. The dark-haired girl used her scepter to lift up the filthy doorway curtain of the toilet and walked inside. Behind the curtain, a strong stench stimulated her olfactory center. A quick analysis was completed within a nanosecond: It was not the smell of ammonia, but a pungent odor of sodium hypochlorite. Perhaps the vast majority of law-abiding citizens of Xianzhou would never imagine an apothecary hiding out in an abandoned public toilet like this. In the darkest depths of this \"apothecary,\" there's a man looking like a healer in a daze. Before he could react, the girl closed in on him with her ghastly form. A chain slithered up like a living being and encoiled him. At the same time, the sharp point of the scepter was pressed against his throat. \"Who did you tell about the secret prescriptions kept in the Elixir Research Terrace?\" the girl hissed, slightly releasing pressure so that he could speak. \"Prescription... I don't know about any prescription... Ugh...\" He only manages to say a few words before the girl tightens her grip, blocking up the words in his throat. \"Who is he?\" she demanded, again relaxing her right hand slightly. \"Ahem... I don't know... Ugh...\" \"How many of the Ten Lords' interrogation methods have you heard of? I'll ask you one last time: Who is he?\" She retracted the spear-like scepter and in a display of strength disproportionate to her size, lifted him up entirely off the ground. \"Ahem... Coventry! Ahem... Albert Coventry! There, I said it! I told you. Please spare me!\" The man suddenly felt all his strength had left his body. Both legs gave way as he collapsed to the ground. When he came back around and tried to see the girl's face, he realized that the entire nightmare interrogation process was as though it never existed \u2014 only the rustling sound from the alleyway remained.

In terms of the result, what value is a secret if nobody knows it? As long as it's still a secret, its true form is not important at all...\" The girl opened the scroll she was carrying and looked thoughtfully at the real-time data refreshing on the map. \"The intel Coventry obtained is not the prescription. Is that what you mean?\" asked the Foxian judge meekly. \"The prescription is just a front.\" said the girl, without looking up. \"So... as far as I am concerned, Coventry is just being used. Some people in the Elixir Research Terrace wanted to stir up chaos to muddle the news of their research. The news of theft is just a ploy for redirection.\" the Foxian said, sending across several notes to the scroll in the girl's hand. \"I've already got the diviner who is able to recover the data presumed lost.\" \"Well done.\" The girl nodded, her tone still ice-cold. When the Foxian judge heard this cold praise, she tried her best to maintain a serious expression but her ears couldn't help wiggling. About three hours later after confirming nobody was following him, Coventry opened the door and called out: \"I'm back.\" As soon as he opened the door, he felt something was off. The room was completely dark. That crazed Xianzhou hacker Mishang used to welcome him back by singing a strange ditty, but this time the room was dead silent. \"Something is wrong,\" he quietly said to himself as he pulled out his weapon. He pushed on into the darkness. Behind the screen that sectioned the room, a white figure emerged slowly. Coventry almost reflexively pulled the trigger of his hand crossbow. A two-inch-long, thin, cyan-colored bolt thrummed, hovering about a foot in front of the delicate face of the young girl. The bolthead crackled with sparks as if trying to break through the invisible barrier. \"H\u2014How did you find me?\" \"Cycrane.\" The response was a cold and emotionless female voice. \"That drone? I released it as soon as I landed!\" cried the man nonchalantly. \"The influenced cycrane has been retrieved by the Realm-Keeping Commission. Its flight path was enough for the Divination Commission to triangulate your whereabouts.\" The girl half-curiously touched the quivering bolthead in the air like teasing a butterfly. This was the moment Coventry was waiting for, the split-second window of opportunity for his escape. He bent his knees and pushed off with the soles of his feet. A purple electrical arc could be seen in the center of his palms. Coventry roamed many worlds and had always fluttered outside the grasp of the Interastral Peace Corporation. He was perpetually on the wanted list, not just because of his well-planned schemes, but also because he knew what to do when he was caught. Under his artificial skin, a network of electrical pulses was implanted, Coventry rarely showed this trick up his sleeves to anyone. Whether it be the long-life species of Xianzhou or the Artisanship Commission's Ingenium creations... With a fully powered strike, they would likely all turn to ashes. \"Electromagnetic field activate!\" \"Gotcha!\" The man felt his enemy in his palm. If it wasn't for the need to concentrate all his attention on maintaining the electrical output, he would have laughed out loud. Smoke rose and sparks flew as the unpleasant smell of burning filled the area. Coventry trembled as if having an epileptic seizure as he struggled to control himself. Upon impact, the pitch-black room spun into a blob of shadow in his unimaginable defeat. \"Your movement is too slow.\" The young girl materialized from within the shadow. M\u2014Movement? Coventry stared at his wrist, bent at an unnatural angle. At some point in time unbeknownst to him, that hand was forcibly pressed against his lower jaw. \"Using electricity without being insulated. What a useless maneuver.\" The judge in white showed no emotions on her face. \"Involuntary Immortalization and Immortality Theft. These two are the gravest of the Ten Unpardonable Sins. Do you admit your guilt?\" The man could not control his shaking, partially because of the electric shock, but more because of the fear. With the remaining sanity he could muster, he begged with his coarse voice, \"Please... Please forgive me. I haven't even peeked at the prescription. I will leave it behind and get my butt off of the Luofu. Please... You will never see me again!\" Coventry steeled his nerves, awaiting the verdict from the judge \u2014 but there was only silence in the darkness. After a long while, he seemed to hear an impossible sneering from out of the darkness. Immediately after, that same cold voice rang out again and in a sacred, firm, and undeniable tone said word-by-word: \"Ten Lords' Verdict.\" Xianzhou Smartie \"Posted on August 20\" Sir!

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5735","text":"Annotations from \"Ode to Reignbow Path\" Annotations from \"Ode to Reignbow Path\" is a readable that can be purchased aboard The Xianzhou Luofu. Text. Part I. [Source Text] Ode to Reignbow Path [\u20201] Anonymous You have not seen the Cangcheng full of Langgan, consumed by the planet of sentient evil, standing firm till the end. You have not seen the Yuanqiao covered in Bigui, sailing on a path of no return. To the crimson star it rends. You have not seen the Daiyu verdant with Shatang, plummeting like a hurtling flame, burnt like lamp oil spent.[\u20202] You have not seen the tumultuous journey in the bowels of space, where human and stars alike are transient as reeds. In the beginning when the world was new, the wastelands to our ancestors did attend. Where nations warred amongst forts, where the plain cavalry's banners did suspend. The wise sovereign quelled the local lords. Using Aurumatons, did deceit cease and mend. All cardinal directions were ruled under one. A world unified, standing unbent.[\u20203] The divine race encroached and covered the sky. From Muldrasil poured these fiends.[\u20204] Then cruisers and dreadnaughts launched to the depths. To Sanctus Medicus, crossing eons, messengers we send.[\u20205] Amongst the Nine was one Yaoqing, its delves had many heroes attend. The greatest among them was the Reignbow. With their bow, even stars may rend. From the budding shores where ambers are plucked, to the stellar abyss where void whales fend.[\u20206] From puppets disempowered by iron mallets, to slaying Viscorpus and having their flags upend.[\u20207] Flames of war snuffed from the five Navium Astriger, mists of memory on the eight Xianzhou ships' rivers ascend.[\u20208] Remember how sovereign ruled the ancient lands, yet the mighty Reignbow none may contend. [Editor's Notes] [\u20201] This poem is in the ode form, a genre which uses free verse rhyme and meter, flexible structure, and often uses words like \"Ode\" in their title. For ease of reading and due to the length of the poem, the editors had split this work into sections based on progression of the narrative. [\u20202] Langgan, Bigui, and Shatang are all mystic trees found in primeval imperium legends, with trunks made of jade and bearing fruits that grant immortality. The Daiyu, the Yuanqiao, and the Cangcheng are all Xianzhou ships that have been destroyed. The Daiyu exploded in 1200 Star Calendar during the campaign against the Viscorpus, a Denizen of Abundance race. The Yuanqiao lost control during the Civil War in 3200 Star Calendar, plunging into a red giant and disappearing completely. The Cangcheng was devoured by the activated planet Rahu, Devourer of Worlds, in 6300 Star Calendar. This suggests that the ode was composed after 6300 Star Calendar, but it's also possible that later authors have amended the original. [\u20203] This section describes the glorious days when the unnamed sovereign united the entire planet during the Primeval Imperium Age of the Xianzhou Alliance. \"Replacement by Aurumaton\" refers to the story of the sovereign's ban on all forms of weaponry and replacing security institutions with Aurumatons and Ingenia to maintain public order. [\u20204] \"The divine race\" means the Wingweavers, one of the Denizens of Abundance races. Muldrasil is this race's home world, a planet-sized giant tree that draws energy from the stars. Here, we can see that the Denizens of Abundance had made contact with various Xianzhou clans as early as the Primeval Imperium Age. [\u20205] \"Sanctus Medicus\" is the Plagues Author, one who presides over the Path of Abundance. Today, this title is mainly reserved for the henchmen of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. [\u20206] \"From the budding shores where ambers are plucked\" refers to when Xianzhou observed the Celestial Comet Wall being built by the Aeon Qlipoth. \"Where void whales fend\" refers to the Xianzhou Alliance coming into contact with the void song whales around Star Calendar. This event should have happened before \"ambers are plucked,\" but the poet inverted their order for linguistic flow. Also, based on historical records, the Reignbow Arbiter was born in approximately 1700 Star Calendar, and could not possibly have participated in the aforementioned events. This is evidently a misappropriation. This occurs repeatedly in the text from here on, and individual instances will not be noted further. [\u20207] \"Puppets disempowered by iron mallets\" refers to the Xianzhou people wresting control of the ships from the Aurumatons, starting around 1400 Star Calendar and finishing with the Heliobi Wars. \"Slaying Viscorpus\" recounts the Xianzhou's battle against the Viscorpus around 1200 Star Calendar. [\u20208] The \"five Navium Astriger\" and the \"eight Xianzhou ships\" are figurative, used to represent the entire flotilla of the Xianzhou Alliance. This is not an actual count. Part II. [Source Text] In multitude, the Xianzhou piloted the Gloomy Hare. In solitude, the Xianzhou drove the Golden Crow.[\u20201] In destiny, they met the homeless floating flames, not knowing that the Heliobi was a poisonous woe. They can trick without words on paper. They can please without poetry or song. Know that illusions are but dreams, and careful to feed demons your joys or tears.[\u20202] The Reignbow perceived like a piercing light. Their bow-arm bent, ready to deal a warring blow. The flaming demons did a red star make, deployed as bait as their fears grew.[\u20203] Two thousand volunteers laid aside their lives. Their bones shall remain on the Navis Astriger, such was the vow. Disassembling a centerguard engine to recast as a drill. With human flesh as its handle, forward they flew. [\u20204] Diving deep into the innards of the Flint Emperor, a thundering explosion the heavenly pavilions did feel. [\u20205] Instantly did the light fade and the star's essence die, the dimming red with its residual lifespan swallowed.[\u20206] Pushing forward to capture the fae fire, we the demon sealed. Forced to nurture the Xianzhou, onward it rowed. [\u20207] [Editor's Notes] [\u20201] In the legends of the Primeval Imperium, the moon was a \"Gloomy Hare,\" while the sun was a \"Golden Crow.\" This refers to the Reignbow (the Xianzhou fleet) sailing across the galaxy. [\u20202] Historical records describe Heliobi as a species of formless energy creatures that can absorb human emotion and influence behaviors. [\u20203] \"Red star\" here refers to the red micro-star formed by the Heliobi to capture the Xianzhou fleet. [\u20204] The Primeval Imperium's literature had stated, \"the frontline is called the vanguard, and behind them stands the centerguard.\" \"Centerguard\" refers to the auxiliary engines of the Xianzhou Yaoqing. This line refers to how the suicide squad, led by the Reignbow, disassembled and weaponized the ship's auxiliary engines to fight the Heliobi. [\u20205] \"Heavenly pavilions\" refers to the \"Skyward Pavilions neighborhood\" residential area aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. Another possible interpretation is the Divination Commission's \"Cloud Pavilion.\" It indicates how widespread the shockwave was felt. [\u20206] Historical records show that the Xianzhou's suicide squad sent the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star formed by the Heliobi, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. This line is the first in the history of Xianzhou literature to describe this process. [\u20207] Based on records, the Xianzhou residents locked up the defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, sentencing them to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life. Part III. [Source Text] In thriving, the Xianzhou piloted the Ice Toad. In meticulous care, the Xianzhou drove the Six Dragons. [\u20201] The vast fleet sailed through time and space, and the title of Heaven's Mast a ship had humbly taken.[\u20202] Many miracles the divine blessing conducted, blurring reality with myth. True liberation. Elevated, the wild horses in eloquence spoke, and Xianzhou's fog and clouds to words hearken. [\u20203] The jade abacus carefully was wrought, calculating all mysteries. The world reduced to a deliberation. The Reignbow merged with the jade, seeking epiphany, and the Wisdomwalker in dreams showed premonition. [\u20204] Yet everlasting prosperity and wisdom Reignbow did not see. There would be fields of corpses, blood soaken. Crippled, defiled, unending agony. Maddened, mutated, total forgetfulness, never to waken. [\u20205] The Reignbow bounded with futile warnings, but was thought mad against diviners, mocked in derision. [\u20206] Then the poor and nobles joined forces against the Reignbow. In scorn, ridicule, pity, or lamentation. Reignbow in a rage scolded the nobles, calling greed for immortality as foolish as the ancient sovereign's obsession. [\u20207] The arbor branches were mere axles to the war chariot, and the Reignbow's fleeting arrow found the divine plantation. Turning, the Reignbow released their flashing arrow to the tree, and fear and horror in human hearts stricken. Yet exiled to cold coffins for long watchful sleep, this warrior of yesteryear all forgotten.[\u20208] [Editor's Notes] [\u20201] The people of the Primeval Imperium once believed that the Moon was an \"ice toad,\" while the Sun was \"six dragons.\" This refers to Reignbow (and the Xianzhou) sailing across the galaxy. [\u20202] \"A ship\" refers to the Xianzhou Luofu, indicating that it was the highest-ranked ship in the Alliance. \"Heaven's Mast\" refers to the Ambrosial Arbor. This is describing how the seeds of the Ambrosial Arbor took root aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. However, the Xianzhou Luofu only became the flagship of the Alliance after receiving the Ambrosial Arbor. Here the sequence is reverted, probably out of artistic license. [\u20203] The people of the Primeval Imperium used \"wild horses,\" \"fog,\" and \"clouds\" to refer generally to clouds, air, and dust. The structure of this sentence is inverted, with the gist being \"even clouds and dust grew eloquent through the Ambrosial Arbor's Elevation.\" According to historical records, the Xianzhou experimented with the Arbor's fruit, \"Elevating\" animals to the point of mimicking human sentience and speech. The line is probably referring to this event. [\u20204] The motif of \"merged with the jade\" originated when the sage Xuan Yao embedding the jade abacus directly into the human skull to peer into the future. This is evidently a misappropriation. The \"Wisdomwalker\" is the one who presides over the Path of Erudition. [\u20205] \"Crippled,\" \"defiled,\" \"maddened,\" \"mutated,\" and \"forgetfulness\" are the five symptoms of being mara-struck. \"Crippled\" means that, after suffering grave injuries from external violence, the body must utilize its self-healing capacities to undergo long and painful periods of repair. \"Defiled\" means that, due to the immortality of the flesh for the Xianzhou people, the body may be forced to eternally co-exist with incurable alien viruses or bacteria. \"Maddened\" means the person starts to feel anger and violent desires, and starts to have extreme mood swings. \"Mutated\" means the flesh is starting to produce mutated organs and can no longer maintain a stable humanoid form. \"Forgetfulness\" means the person's mind is taken over by a sense of emptiness, and spends their days in an oblivious daze. This section describes how, after the Reignbow became one with the jade, they saw the tragic future of the Xianzhou residents, where the people became mara-struck due to their immortality. [\u20206] \"Mad against Diviners\" originates from a Xianzhou folk legend about a person who believed the Ambrosial Arbor to be an alien monstrosity. Opposed to longevity, they feigned madness to publicly express their ardent opinion. Here, \"Diviners\" generally refers to the Xianzhou aristocrats, and can be extended to include the Arbor's fruit, as the aristocrats were the first Xianzhou residents to receive the sacred fruit. [\u20207] \"Ancient sovereign's obsession\" refers to the nameless sovereign who united the Primeval Imperium. The Reignbow thought the Xianzhou residents were blinded by the seduction of an endless lifespan and were no different from the nameless sovereign's rapacious fear of death. This drove Reignbow furious. [\u20208] This section describes the Reignbow's opposition to immortality, and how they shot an arrow into the Ambrosial Arbor to show their resolve. The Xianzhou aristocrats who had eaten the fruit of immortality grew enraged and convicted them. However, awed by the Reignbow's heroic exploits and prestige, they could only sentence the hero to continual hibernation. \"Watchful sleep\" refers to the rotating cryo-sleep system used when the Xianzhou Alliance first left its home world. \"Cold coffins\" are the cryo-sleep pods. Part IV. [Source Text] The years came and went, as the fleet floated in uncertainty. Muldrasil the gigantic we first beheld, as it sucked the stars' energies till all were empty. Monstrous flesh thronged about, thick as fog. The divine race flattered their wings, like clouds aplenty. [\u20201] All foresaw the coming catastrophe, but naught could repulse such an almighty. Invading branches cut to deter the tree from the ships, starskiffs surrounded by arms clashing in activity. Brilliant stratagem needed for dire plight, the Reignbow roused out of necessity. [\u20202] Tell not the glorious to rest with their wine, but prays for the Heliobus to encase their entity. Tell not the warrior to rest in slumber, but with the Flint Emperor to assault our nemesis, without charity. [\u20203] Human lives are but a transient lightning. The fate of heroes never lies in their own hands, never with certainty. All the people rose to follow the Reignbow's example, daring to guard the sky and protect home and company.[\u20204] [Editor's Notes] [\u20201] \"Thick as fog\" and \"clouds aplenty\" describe the vast size of the Denizens of Abundance's armed forces. [\u20202] To repulse the invasion, the Xianzhou people decided to raise Reignbow from their slumber. Once awakened, the Reignbow analyzed the situation and concocted a strategy to break the deadlock. [\u20203] Reignbow ignored common advice, heading into the prison deep within the Xianzhou Zhuming and persuaded the imprisoned Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, to help the Xianzhou fight off the Denizens of Abundance. They made a deal and the Reignbow allowed the Flint Emperor to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. [\u20204] Inspired by the hero's sacrifice, many Xianzhou residents made the same heroic deal. They formed suicide squads and marched alongside the Heliobi. As clouds that cover the heavens, will the warriors protect the Xianzhou and soar eternal. This is the origin story of the name \"Cloud Knights.\" [Postscript] This part describes the \"Flaming Catastrophe,\" one of the Three Sufferings of the Era of Bloodshed (approximately 3000 \u2014 4000 Star Calendar). At the time, the Xianzhou Zhuming detected gravity waves from a massive object, but failed to capture any light signals. Only when the Xianzhou Alliance drew nearer did the stargazers realize that this massive object was a Dyson tree feeding off nearby stars. It was also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium \u2014 Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers. What petrified the Xianzhou even more was that the ship behemoths of the Viscorpus also appeared. The Viscorpus were directed by the Wingweavers, and the two races were living in a symbiotic relationship. As if attracted by the power of the Ambrosial Arbor, Muldrasil slowly began approaching the Luofu, and the most epic battle in the history of Xianzhou soon broke out. Fatigued from the Civil War (the \"Living Catastrophe\" of the Three Sufferings), the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, the Xianzhou residents were powerless to counter such a crisis. They released all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation \u2014 including the hero of this epic ode, the Reignbow. Part V. [Source Text] The Reignbow stood constant at the helm, steady with Xuanyuan, holding firm. [\u20201] Forget life, and be convinced in your resolve for death. Now, in swift battle we shall rebuke the swarm. [\u20202] In the future may we always triumph, and cleanse the enemy with courage and vigor and arms. [\u20203] Dazzling jade whistled through space, as the full might of the arrow pierced the stars and gloom. The skies billowed in a lightning sea, and the planets cracked open in thunderous inky doom. The arrow fell from mountains' heights, and arrowhead whistling loud as valley gales that loom. Blood rain poured upon the Xuling and nights turned crimson on the Fanghu, all souls shaken to their very bone. [\u20204] The sentient timber all shrivelled and collapsed, torn asunder with void forces in torrential streams. [\u20205] When the clouds and dust had diffused, the fae king and the Reignbow were nowhere to be seen. [\u20206] Only their arms did remain and were reforged, cast into ingots, committed to Jiyuan gloom. To electromagnetic cloud those were sent, to circle the skies and shine with stellar bloom. [\u20207] Sorrow and lamentation amongst the stars spread, tears and cries for their end, unfathomed. Woe is the hero and all their shed tears. They no longer chase the Luofu, but other stars that roam. [Editor's Notes] [\u20201] \"Xuanyuan\" is a famed bow of legend from the Primeval Imperium. Here, it refers to the Reignbow's weapon. [\u20202] This line transitions rather bluntly. Together with the next line, it is possibly a speech by the Reignbow to boost morale before the battle. Another interpretation is that the Reignbow knew their death was near, and deliberately left their final words. [\u20203] This may be the origin behind the common battle cries of the Cloud Knights \u2014 \"May the Xianzhou soar, and may the Cloud Knights triumph!\" and \"Cleanse our enemies with courage and vigor!\", but it's also possible that later generations amended this. Academics hold different theories, and the order of the lines is still up for debate. [\u20204] The historical record shows the battle formation during this war was in this order, from the nearest to Muldrasil to the furthest: the Yaoqing, the Luofu, the Yuque, the Zhuming, the Fanghu, the Cangcheng, and the Xuling. The Xuling and Fanghu were far from the frontlines. Other records point to the Reignbow firing their arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing. This line describes the size of the impact from the Reignbow's star-shattering shot, and how every ship in the Xianzhou Alliance was affected. [\u20205] Based on historical records, the Reignbow's arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrated the almighty beast, and severed the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil. This ripped open a fissure into the void, and a monstrous wave of imaginary force spewed forth from it. This line describes that event. [\u20206] Based on historical records, the Reignbow disappeared after shooting the arrow that turned the tide of battle, but the Flint Emperor had left behind part of their body. This line claims that the Xianzhou people could find neither of them. Perhaps this poem records mere rumor. [\u20207] \"Ingot,\" \"Jiyuan,\" \"electromagnetic cloud,\" and \"circle\" in these two lines describe how the people of Xianzhou, in commemorating the Reignbow's sacrifice, embedded their relics into a Jiyuan ingot and launched it into Muldrasil's orbit, so it can shine as long as the star exists. There is no mention of such in existing records, and the incident may be poetic license from the author. Moreover, this is the first ever mention of the Jiyuan Ingot launch ceremony in the history of Xianzhou literature, but neither the time that this custom started nor the date of this ode's composition can be verified."}

To combat this, the Interastral Peace Corporation gave the group large quantities of basic protection gears which lowered the casualty rate by 9.72% on paper. At a point either before or during the Swarm Disaster, a Armed Archaeologist who had researched Lepismat was murdered, leaving a note containing all their findings.

The Artisanship Commission is all about crafting and manufacturing. Any object imaginable that can be manufactured, such as weapons, ship parts, ingenious robots, and artificial intelligence are all produced by the craftsmasters here. They pursue ingenious skills and strive for the goal of completing the \"Great Smelting Furnace\" ritual, and being awarded the title of \"Furnace Master.\" Shards of the Lux Arrow can be reforged by the Furnace Master, chief of the Xianzhou artisans, for those who are worthy. The verses \"Smelt for a thousand stars; quicken with steel of heroes. The forge's light boosts power and might; and armaments guard both hearth and meal.\" hang in adornment in the main hall of the Flamedisk Forge Palace. The Artisanship Commission's Hall of Jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process, making it difficult for outworlders to observe the manufacturing process. History. An unknown emperor of the Primeval Imperium was said to have once gifted the master craftsman of the Zhuming, Yang Di, with a weapons-casting mold in honor of its maiden voyage. To this day it remains, passed down through the ages to be the pride of place in the Flamedisk Forge Palace, the foundational base of the Xianzhou Zhuming's Artisanship Commission. It was said that the craftsmen on the Zhuming were liberal in form and definition and that the residents had completely transformed the ship beyond recognition since their departure. At the end of the Heliobi Wars, the defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, was imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life. The craftsmen of the Zhuming used every means available to imprison it in the furnace and used its power to forge various divine weapons. It was also rumored that the Creation Furnace in the Xianzhou Luofu was powered by an imprisoned Heliobus. After the Crisis of Belief between the Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar, the Firmamend Temple became an affiliated academy of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission. It took the Artisanship Commission of the Xianzhou Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the Caelorum Venti Pavilion in Moon Delve with large slabs of jade and moonstone and is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style. Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment. The pavilion became one of the most well-known tourist sites of the Yaoqing and commemorates how the previous Caelorum Venti fought valiantly and slew a herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. Once, a delegation containing Baiheng and a dozen others were sent to request for arms and reinforcements from the Zhuming for the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Crane Feather Orbit Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the Borisin. They were recieved by General Huaiyan's apprentice, Yingxing, at Radiant Zenith and escorted through by the Flamedisk Forge Palace, where they observed the Flint Emperor's light being sealed. There, they met with Huaiyan, who was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Helm-Master Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel. Sometime in the past, Ardens Regia, the high elder of the Xianzhou Zhuming, sent a Vidyadhara craftsman to the Luofu to teach the masters of the Luofu Artisanship Commission about craftsmanship. The craftsman then started their hatching rebirth with the intent to pass back their improved knowledge back to the Zhuming after their rebirth. In recent history, Master Gongshu of the Luofu Artisanship Commission had developed a weapon that utilizes heliobus energy called the Luminflux Pyxis."}

Text. \"*The family insignia with hot foil stamping on the letterhead looks exquisite, but the jagged creases betray its prior life in the trash can.*\" The First Letter Asta: The health of your great-grandmother has deteriorated. Please come home as soon as possible! Uncle Balint The Second Letter Dear Asta: Balint assigned his men to guard the ward, and your cousins and I have tried for a few times, but his men still won't allow us to come close. I clashed with him during a video call a few days ago, and he insisted on not allowing us to video talk with the hospital, so I'm not sure what the situation is with great-grandma. Your father is still on Planet Larchmont and hasn't returned, and he hasn't responded to any of the messages I've sent him, so I'm not sure what's going on. But I think Balint... he probably just wants to continue exploiting IPC, I don't think he will harm your great-grandmother. You don't have to be worried too much about your great-grandmother because the galaxy's best medical services are here, so there won't be any serious issues. However, I am concerned about you, a girl out wandering to study the star rail. Balint appears to have become desperate recently, and I'm concerned that he'll do something horrible to you. You should hire some reliable security staff... but it's okay, I looked at your route, and the closest planet to you is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the coordinates are \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and there is an IPC subsidiary there under my name. You can go right over there. I've got a squad of very competent security staff waiting for you. Remember: don't believe anything Balint says! Love, Aunt Taylor The Third Letter Asta: You've been toying with telescopes and stars for so long that you've forgotten who you are. Great-grandma has mentioned you countless times. Please return home quickly! Uncle Balint The Fourth Letter Miss Asta: Please accept my apologies for any inconvenience this has caused you! May I inquire if you have recently visited the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Group in Planet \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, in which IPC has an investment, and if you have signed an agreement to transfer the family shares at 5:31 p.m. local time? The Foundation received this document yesterday morning, but after discovering that the digital origin of the agreement does not correspond to your usual location for the past three months, the process has been temporarily halted. Please keep an eye on your security device today and tomorrow for communication from the Group's legal counsel. Gilson, Chairman of the Family Trust Fund Committee Fifth Letter Dear Asta: I was able to reach Dad. He had been hit by an electromagnetic storm, which rendered all communication devices unusable. Are you still looking for the elusive comet rail? If you aren't too busy, you should come back. There's been a lot going on lately at home. You should be wary of Aunt Taylor. The trust fund alerted me the other day that she forged an agreement to transfer your shares, but thankfully you did not cooperate... Anyway, I'll tell you all about it when you get home. By the way, do you have enough money? I looked over last month's bill. How did you manage to spend such little money if you hired a scientific research fleet to accompany you on an expedition? Have you run out of pocket money yet? My baby daughter, don't skimp on food or lodging to save money. Please let me know if you don't have enough money. Love, Mom"}

Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of meeting you and introducing myself to you at a charity event hosted by your family. But I know that a fine lady like you, who comes from a noble family and is well-educated and intelligent, would not care about such trivial matters. I'd like to introduce myself once again. Oh, I genuinely hope you're the most brilliant lady, as the rumor has it. I am Ryan, the founder of the Galactic Association of Entrepreneurs, as well as the chairman of the Galaxy Energy Unlimited Group, and the founder of the Universe High Energy Metafield Space. Throughout the last ten years of hard effort, I was lucky to get long-distance counsel from an anonymous member of the \"Genius Society\" in my sleep, and when I awoke from my dream, I successfully created the Universe High Energy Metafield Space. I once submitted a business proposal to your group concerning the Metafield Space, but your offer did not meet the value I expected, and I passed up an excellent opportunity to work with you. However, I am the founder of the Association of Entrepreneurs, and several of our keen members have informed me of your email address via our extensive network. You are, in my opinion, the most gifted heir of the great families in the last few centuries. Furthermore, I am aware of your family's involvement in IPC. As a result, I'd like to invite you to join me in starting a business. Only a young prodigy of noble lineage and great potential, such as yourself, can realize how my incredible invention, the Universe High Energy Metafield Space, will certainly add the most dazzling touch to your legendary career. Ryan Sent Email To: Ryan@GalaxyEnergyUnlimited From: Asta@HertaSpaceStation Cc: Nina@IPCDataSecurityDepartment Email Content: After years of research, I discovered something new in the universe that no one else had observed: the universe contains a high-speed particle known as the scammer particle. Scammer particles rotate at high speeds around normal organisms, forming the foundation of the metafield's elemental matter. Under constant external high-energy conceptual stimulation, the scammer particles leap to the high-energy state and then return to the low-energy state after a brief period of time, accumulating credits from the outside world. However, there is another type of anti-particle among the stars, surrounded by a swarm of scammers. The anti-scammer particle will eventually explode and discharge its own energy, stripping the scammer particle of its positive valence form and causing it to disintegrate. This antiparticle was discovered by me. You're a moron for trying to scam me. Founder of the Anti-Scammer Particle Theory \u2014 Asta"}

The Astral Express was created by Akivili, the Aeon of the Trailblaze, to transport them and the Nameless across the galaxy. Legends claim that Akivili's heart powers the Express' core, although Himeko has found no evidence to support that claim. Shortly after the fall of their Aeon, a loyal group of Nameless took Akivili's trailblazing legacy upon themselves. However, the star rail became overly obstructed as Stellarons began spreading across the galaxy, preventing the Express from running. It eventually fell into disrepair and was abandoned. Some time later, the Astral Express crash-landed onto an unnamed planet, where it was discovered by Himeko.

Story. History. The Xianzhou Alliance, a fleet of nine ships, embarked on a Lone Voyage to seek out Yaoshi for immortality. After finding Yaoshi, the Xianzhou Luofu was gifted with the Ambrosial Arbor, a giant tree that took root on the ship. The ancestors of the Luofu people ate its fruits and became a long-life species. However, this came with a heavy price. What followed was population expansion and diminishing resources. Other beings attacked the Xianzhou to take their sacred artifact and countless atrocities were committed. Those who survived the war realized they were susceptible to \"Mara,\" a condition long-life species suffer, turning them into \"Beasts.\" They began to resent it. Other plaguemarks, also known as Traces of Abundance, include the Lunar Embryo on the Yaoqing, the Primordial Flame on the Zhuming, the Miniature Myriads on the Fanghu, and the Fallow Earth on the Yuque. According to Sushang, the Yaoqing's plaguemark is a moon. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara, and the five high elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, high elder of the Luofu at the time, made the decision to flood Scalegorge Waterscape with the waters of the ancient sea in order to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor. The statue at Dragonvista Rain Hall was erected in honor of this. As a reward for their watch over the plaguemarks, the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Xianzhou Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship. List of Plaguemarks. Ambrosial Arbor. The Ambrosial Arbor is a large tree on the Xianzhou Luofu. It once bore fruits that bestowed long life to the Xianzhou Natives. The immortality brought by the Arbor caused population expansion, diminishing resources, and the condition known as mara. Other beings attacked the Xianzhou to take the Arbor. The Arbor was severed in the Flaming Catastrophe War around Year 3400 Star Calendar. Around 30 years after the Third Abundance War that occurred in Year 8072 Star Calendar, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus revived the Arbor with the power of a Stellaron. Phantylia took control of the Arbor and possessed a body created by the Arbor after the defeat of the Disciples. It went dormant after the defeat of Phantylia. Primordial Flame. The Primordial Flame, also known as the Flint Emperor, was the leader of the Heliobi, a rare species of the Denizens of Abundance. The heliobi are energy beings with the power to possess people's bodies. After the heliobi were defeated in a war with the Xianzhou, the craftsmen of the Xianzhou Zhuming imprisoned the Flint Emperor in a furnace and used it as a power source and to forge various divine weapons. During the Flaming Catastrophe War around Year 3400 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou hero Reignbow made a deal with the Flint Emperor. The Reignbow allowed the Flint Emperor to possess his body in return for the heliobi's power. The Flint Emperor left behind part of their body. Lunar Embryo. The Lunar Embryo is the plaguemark of the Xianzhou Yaoqing. It is a moon. Fallow Earth. The Fallow Earth is the plaguemark of the Xianzhou Yuque.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2173","text":"Planet Screwllum's Mechanical Sun Planet Screwllum's Mechanical Sun is a Relic piece in the set Celestial Differentiator. Description. Regarding the origin of mechanical life, the carbon-based scholars of the Intelligentsia Guild have a unique speculation: A cluster of electrons born by chance. Electric currents flow through throughout the atmosphere and ground. It separated into secondary forms of different magnitudes under the countless acts of gravity and repulsive forces. According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life. A mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spot such fallacies? As soon as the word came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to its core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin. However, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march \u2014 their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed first to find a way for their population to survive. In the end, they decided to carry out a plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable super-ecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star. With their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner. The massive system is filled with the sound of bearing grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into countless branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause the Screwllumites' imaginations to wander. The steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits. They will continue to ponder and explore their origins until the ever-present mechanical sun completely burns out."}

Description. The vast majority of Screwllumites were unaware that Planet Screwllum was a great attempt by inorganic life to investigate their origin. Screwllum felt a little empty. The event of understanding the operation logic of Planet Screwllum did not even cause any exceptional fluctuations in his Intelligent Pulse Waveform. He stood on the wide terrace of his mansion, looking up at the unstoppable planetary engine. The ring system with dense square holes pierced up from the back of the planet. Everything the planet supports was situated on the strip, revolving quietly with the engine as its axis, day after day. He had seen the despairingly absurd nature of this planetary system: An elegant string of state transient equations, a giant, icy cylinder \u2014 that's all Planet Screwllum is, nothing more. According to his interpretation of the equations, at the birth of the Celestial Differentiator, its lead creator tried to explain the origin of the universe as a cellular automaton and its recursion, and Planet Screwllum itself was a result of the game of life. Screwllumites and other inorganic life on the planet acted as the \"cells\" in this automaton, while also being smaller-scale cellular automatons. Automatons were always made up of many smaller automatons, going back to the smallest components that form the building blocks of the universe. What was the smallest component? No one knows. Neither Screwllum nor the scholar who first proposed building the Celestial Differentiator do. That was why Screwllum felt empty. Did that scholar's attempt fail? But the Celestial Differentiator had worked tirelessly for many Amber Eras. Did that not mean that the origin of the Screwllumites, their parent star, and even the entire universe can be attributed to that elegant string of equations? Not really. Until the super-ecosystem collapsed entirely, the equations remained unfalsifiable. He swirled the fine glass of machine oil, never taking his eyes off the ring that recorded the truth of the planet. The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. Do ends to recursions really exist? He thought. What is the nature of inorganic life \u2014 or yet, what is the origin of the universe? Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors? \"No,\" Screwllum concluded. He decided to seek answers."}

If we don't turn the other cheek and show friendship, it could damage our alliance with the Xianzhou people. And that's undoubtedly what the Preceptors would hate to see. Therefore, I propose that the Luofu Vidyadhara should temporarily move away from the rule of the high elder and instead submit to rule by the council of Preceptors, to ensure \"[Missing]\" Preceptor Taoran said: Lady Xuepu, you've served as one of Dan Feng's tutors during his development phase. The disasters he has waged are now inextricably linked to the indulgence of you, his teachers. Dan Feng's imprisonment is his own fault, and has nothing to do with the succession of high elders. I shall repeat: The ancestors have formulated laws, and these cannot be changed. Our solemn responsibility is to confiscate the Transmutation Arcanum and the Orb of Abysm from Dan Feng to uphold the continuation of the Ichor Lines. Your bold suggestion of Preceptors entangling in political activity is the height of malice! Preceptor Fenghuan said: Some people keep secret little scores within themselves. Few dare to expose them. Then allow me to clear the air here and now: The Preceptor Council is a stop-gap measure for when the High Elder position is vacant or governance is untenable, but Xuepu's message rings loud and clear. She wants to take advantage of \"[Missing]\" being cut off to completely replace the High Elder position with the Preceptor Council. Preceptor Xuepu said: I shall recommend that you do not slander me. Preceptor Fenghuan said: Then you have misunderstood. I am in agreement with you. The High Elder system is an outdated one, handing over power to a single chosen one. This has caused countless tragedies in the history of our kind. Now that Dan Feng has been detained by the Ten Lords, isn't now the perfect time to hand back power to the people? Or are you saying that these people are so used to being loyal subjects that they're incapable of learning how to be their own masters? \"The Preceptors erupted loudly in a ruckus, debating and cursing each other.

Tourists in Penacony Reach an All-Time High As of the day of the broadcast, the number of Dreamchasers who visit Penacony has reached ten billion, breaking the record of this Amber Era. The people's enthusiasm for traveling has driven a positive growth in Penacony's economy, as evidenced by the sales of SoulGlad and its related products indicating a tenfold year-on-year growth.According to the survey, nearly 60% of the guests have heard of Penacony before their visit. They looked forward to their trip here and were excited to experience the goodness of the Dreamscape themselves. The rest of the guests were drawn to the upcoming Charmony Festival.This prosperous scene is largely attributed to the wise leadership of The Family and the joint efforts of each major lineage. Undoubtedly, the Charmony Festival around the corner is bound to be a lively event. The Respectable Mr. Sunday Presents A Special Speech The respectable Mr. Sunday, the representative of The Family, has delivered a special speech in response to the recent thriving tourism industry of Penacony.According to Mr. Sunday, this achievement is the result of the collaboration among all lineages in Penacony, and the glory should be shared. Without the Oak Family's coordination, the Bloodhound Family's protection, the Alfalfa Family's management, the Iris Family's artistic performances, and the Nightingale Family's technical support, our Dreamscape wouldn't be as amazing as it is today.This accomplishment illustrates the fact that unity is the most powerful force in universe. Mr. Sunday is confident that Penacony's tourism industry will continue to reach greater heights in the near future, allowing more people to experience the harmony and beauty of the place. He also hopes every guest will enjoy their time in the Dreamscape, and that The Family is committed to ensuring their safety and enjoyment. SoulGlad Be the Syrup Trendsetter To celebrate the upcoming Charmony Festival, SoulGlad has announced the launch of a new product \u2014 the SoulGlad Sharing Pack. The product, which contains a dozen palm-sized bottles of SoulGlad, encourages the spirit of sharing for the purchasers, through which one can experience the harmonious tune of the Great One.As the leading enterprise in Penacony, SoulGlad has been serving the guests for almost five Amber Eras. To this day, Dreamchasers still take delight in talking about the story of the enterprise's founder, Mr. Aideen. In this superstar's recent speech, he touched on the rapid development of Penacony and emphasized the need to actively respond to the guests' needs. It is only through that can we seize the opportunities the times have presented and achieve success.In the new Amber Era, SoulGlad will continue to invest and innovate, striving to provide a more diverse range of healthier and tastier products that will form part of the future beautiful Dreamscape. Currency Dispenser Loophole Exploiter Busted Recently, investigators from the Bloodhound Family have solved a major case concerning the theft of cash from a currency dispenser and recovered several hundred thousand credits. The operation has successfully maintained the market order in Penacony.It was discovered that the designer of the machine added a hidden feature in the machine, causing it to dispense a considerable amount of high-value banknotes when the user carries out certain actions in the correct sequence. The suspect took advantage of this loophole and stole a large amount of money from the currency dispenser. Due to financial security concerns, the details of the crime are not disclosed.As of now, all of the illicit gains of the suspect have been returned to the Alfalfa Bank. We would like to remind everyone to be more vigilant when it comes to financial issues. Please acquire wealth ethically and refrain from taking shortcuts. The Family Plans To Make New Expansions In The Dreamscape Given that guests are getting more keen to visit Penacony, The Family has announced its decision to develop a new area in the Dreamscape.Artists of all kinds from all over the universe come together, ready to fire on all cylinders to create an amazing Dreamscape for the guests. Currently, these Dreamweavers have arrived in the designated expansion area where the construction is underway at full throttle.We believe it will not be long before the new area opens its door to all guests. Let us all look forward to even grander Dreamscape experiences offered by the new expansion."}

Description. As the clouds parted, the moon's shadowy light poured over the Warmuhtar's scarred body. The huge claw that was slashed off by the silver-haired swordsmaster was left aside, and the desperate Warmuhtar's blood vessels pulsated furiously. Accompanied by a long, painful howl, he grew his sharp claw once more. Catalyzed by Moon Madness, the Warmuhtar barely caught up with the moonlight-like sword strikes. He prayed silently to the power of Abundance, determined to finish the final fight as a trapped beast. He had already forgotten how many times the borisin army had broken through, only remembering the countless times his soldiers had used their claws to tear open the gaps in their advance, only for it to tightly close again. The exhausted borisin relied on their nigh indestructible regeneration, struggling to tear down all obstacles before them \u2014 The Warmuhtar's blood soaked his claws and he sank into a trance, only to suddenly realize that he had nowhere to run, and there are no more soldiers following him. \"Borisin Brood Lord, you have taken countless lives by your own hand. Your wrists shall be bound in lead and stone and put under strict control.\" The Warmuhtar finally collapsed, powerless, in front of the swordsmaster. For the first time, he felt that exhausting near-death experience. \"What an incomparable blade,\" he couldn't help but think, \"What an incomparable thrill!\""}

The borisin worship the concept of a strong body, seeing strong physique as a blessing from the gods. The Warmuhtar is both the spiritual leader and the strongest warrior of the tribe, commanding its tide-like army, and dominating life and death on the battlefield. The fearsome beast ships setting off covered the very sky, and he looked down at the restless warriors on the battlefield \u2014 The borisin Warmuhtar felt the call of Moon Madness. Sharp bone spikes pierced through his body, and his pitch-black blood disappeared in the wind like mist. He stretched out his arms like a martyr \u2014 the borisin's Lupitoxin, the fear-inducing pheromone, dispersed along with the blood mist and stimulated the borisin warriors' senses, making them seem possessed by the power of gods and demons. \"O' Brood Lord, grant us muscles of iron and bones of steel. O' Brood Lord, grant us the power of the gods.\" He recalled the days when flesh and blood were not restrained. Children of the borisin, who carry Moon Madness in them, had broken through the limitations of flesh and blood. Their bodies erupted and deformed, yet no longer able to feel pain or fear.

They have their own beliefs and ways \u2014 wherever the borisin set foot, it becomes their territory and nation. The borisin Warmuhtar takes pride from igniting one flame of war after another, crushing the dignity of protectors, drinking the tears of the displaced, and trampling on the trust of close ones. He allowed thorns to grow wild and fertile land to be destroyed, forced people into slavery and enjoyed an extravagant life... In order to surpass the past leaders, the new Warmuhtar had to cast aside peace and lead his soldiers on an expedition to the outside world in order to make a name for himself and affirm his position in the tribe. \"Borisin Brood Lord, with you come war and a scourge upon all worlds.

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=34689","text":"Project Scarab Project: Scarab is a readable found on Penacony. Text. I. Objective Penacony \u2014 an all-encompassing utopia, a gilded city of dreams, has long been a prosperous city full of vibrant life under the leadership of The Family. However, little do most know that tourism \u2014 a significant source of Penacony's income \u2014 has experienced a slowdown in recent years![Note: Please provide specific data pertaining to the relevant years.] In my opinion, this poses a considerable potential danger to the city's development. If left unaddressed, it could have serious implications for the entire economic system! Recognizing the massive business opportunity in this issue, I solemnly present this business plan![Note: Please provide supporting evidence for your statements, and refrain from excessive use of exclamation marks.] II. Activity Format Nobody truly knows the Watchmaker, but everyone wants to become the Watchmaker. This mysterious name has swiftly become a sensation across galaxies, captivating countless tourists eager to embark on a thrilling treasure-hunting adventure. Upon arrival, these visitors instead often lose themselves in endless festivities, indulging in neverending pleasure and hedonism.[Note: Please use concise and precise language.] The economic benefits brought about by treasure-hunting enthusiasts are already apparent to all. Therefore, I think we should seize this opportunity to emulate the legend of the Watchmaker and employ suitable promotional methods to reignite the treasure-hunting fervor within the Dreamscape! My preliminary idea is about creating an exquisitely crafted piece of jewelry (such as a scarab made of gold and gems). Then, we will give a captivating legend for the scarab (drawing inspiration from myths and folklore on certain planets regarding this animal) and ensure its prominent display and widespread awareness through intensified marketing. That way, when tourists become weary of ordinary entertainment and material joys available in Penacony, they will be definitely attracted by this unique and profound narrative. After that, we will launch sufficiently thrilling activities at the opportune moment, and will surely receive substantial revenue![Note: Refrain from excessive use of subjective language such as \"I think,\" \"I believe,\" and \"definitely.\"] Once the trend is established, we should capitalize on its accumulated popularity by organizing re-runs of this event in phases, while incorporating new surprise elements outside of the guests' expectations, optimizing their joy and entertainment.[Note: Objectively present the reasons why the aforementioned strategies may prove effective supported by reliable arguments, and elaborate in detail the events to be re-run and what the surprise elements will be.] III. Market Analysis It is widely known that people respect and are fascinated by great or unknown phenomena.[Note: It is also widely known that the \"Market Analysis\" section should be based on market research reports, data modeling analysis, and supporting arguments, rather than personal beliefs.] I have heard of a person commissioned by a lunatic to traverse a pit with a candle in hand, only because the lunatic believed that this action would change the world. This illustrates how seemingly purposeless actions often ignite enthusiasm and even obsession in people. After all, the satisfaction derived from the exploration process itself imbues meaning into all aspects of people's lives.[Note: Refrain from speculative analyses devoid of users' actual needs as the premise.] Fueled by curiosity and the desire for discovery, guests will make investments whose value far surpasses that of the treasure itself, yet still derive immense enjoyment from the experience. This forms the essence of the so-called \"treasure-hunting complex\" and serves as the inspiration behind \"Project: Scarab\"! [Note: Avoid elaborating extensively on your design inspiration, quoting obscure references, or fabricating abstract concepts in a business plan.] IV. Conclusion The target of \"Project: Scarab\" is to revitalize the tourism economy in Penacony. At the same time, it will fully showcase the city's values and The Family's harmonious love to the visitors who flock here due to our fame. Through this project, we aim to achieve both material benefits and psychological fulfillment. With great enthusiasm, I present this business plan in the hopes of making a humble contribution to the success of The Family and Penacony. Feedback 1. The content of this plan lacks clarity, coherence, and objective discussion, failing to meet the basic standards of a business plan. 2. The content of the writing is logically confusing, lacking practical case studies, market research, planning, and specific strategies. It lacks feasibility. 3. The plan lacks the capability for problem identification and rational analysis, providing a limited understanding of the market and customer needs. The proposed solutions lack reference value. In conclusion, the business plan is hereby rejected. Feinman, Leader of the Tourism Business Team, Marketing Development Department"}

We may see them busily going about their business every day, but few people know what it is our attendants get up to on workdays. Come with us to gain a deeper understanding of this group of people who are utterly familiar yet still unknown. \u00bb&gt;(Insert opening of the Protecting Starskiff Haven) There might be no busier place than the Starskiff Haven in the Xianzhou Luofu, with its frequent trading. Locals from Xianzhou and Outworlders here have the money they need for necessities as they repeat the motions of their everyday lives. \"Dahao's notes: Uh. There's something I would like to bring to everyone's attention. Please keep the term \"Outworlder\" to a minimum in scripts for official publicity. Instead, use things like, \"honorable guest from afar\" or \"visiting traveler.\" You know how it is. This is what the boss wants. Everything's all about open and inclusive cultural exchanges these days. Outworlder could come across as a bit xenophobic...\" However, unexpected dissonance can rear its head in any beautiful place throughout the galaxy. Bringing that dissonance back in line and continuing to compose the symphony that is life requires the hard work of the Realm-Keeping Commission. Just like today... It was supposed to be another beautiful day with a pleasant breeze and sunshine. Not long after lunch, the attendant Xuguang was on patrol at the port of Starskiff Haven. She felt happy to see the prosperous and bustling marketplace. \u00bb&gt;(Insert sound of alarms) But just then, there was suddenly an alert that soured Xuguang's mood. The person who notified the authorities said that there were two Outworlders who were about to start a duel at the entrance of the Sleepless Earl. Xuguang took off as soon as she received the report. She rushed to the scene and arrived before the two Outworlders could trigger a bloody tragedy. After getting the two to calm down and stabilizing the situation, Xuguang started to question them about what was going on. \u00bb&gt;(Insert materials on the customs of the Aigaians) It turns out that Zaman and Akella are both Aigaians from the same village. They came to Xianzhou with the dream of revitalizing their village's entertainment industry and swore to bring back Xianzhou's rich entertainment culture with them. \u00bb&gt;(Insert simulation video)A few days ago, Zaman came across a broker who said he could help him get a core technology patent for Butterfly Immersia. Zaman became overwhelmed by the greatness of his dream as he imagined his glorious return home with entertainment that belongs exclusively to Xianzhou in hand. Without a second thought, he took half of his and Akella's assets and bought this supposedly key technology patent. Of course, there was no way for an Outworlder to get their hands on any of Xianzhou's technologies so easily. All Zaman managed to purchase was a patent for some trivial technology. Zaman went to the Sleepless Earl to worry about his troubles once he realized he got scammed. That's when he saw Akella, who made a special trip to see Zaman. \"Dahao's notes: The first line of this paragraph is unconsciously revealing a hint of xenophobia. Don't make our guests think you look down on others because you are part of an advanced civilization.\" Akella was full of excitement as he shared about buying a key technology patent for Butterfly Immersia from a broker. He thought the price was quite reasonable as he only paid the broker half of their combined assets. After getting into a heated discussion over the matter, these two poor souls without a cent to their names believed the only way to wrap this issue up was to duel. \u00bb&gt;(Insert an ad from sponsors) Part II. \u00bb&gt;(Video logo: Publicity Department of the Realm-Keeping Commission) Even when compared to all the thorny issues the Realm-Keeping Commission had to handle, Zaman and Akella's issue belong to the thorniest variety. \u00bb&gt;(Insert material on Aigaian civilization) Life on Xianzhou is innately different from what Outworlders are used to. Many of the regulations that govern Xianzhou aren't applied to Outworlders. In legal practice, cases that involve Outworlders from the same civilization, sentencing often is based on the laws from where they're from. \"Dahao's notes: l'm tired. Please replace all instances of the word \"Outworlder\" with \"honorable guest.\"\" The individuals in this case, Zaman and Akella, belong to the Aigaian civilization, which holds that duels are capable of resolving conflicts of any nature. Therefore, from a legal perspective, Xianzhou locals have no right to interfere with their duels. However, the line between emotion and law is perhaps not so clear. \u00bb&gt;(Insert scenario restoration video and law enforcement recording.) \"What year is this, huh!?\" Having heard the whole story, Xuguang shouted and moved to stand in between the two to keep them from hurting each other. Akella argued his point. \"It doesn't matter what year it is. Duels are the best way for an Aigaian to demonstrate their dignity!\" \"But neither of you was the one that cheated you out of your assets. What's the point of trying to rough each other up?\" Xuguang replied. \"It's true.\" Zaman said, \"But if one of us hadn't fallen for that scam, then we wouldn't be completely broke! We don't even have money to get back home!\" \u00bb&gt;(Insert heartfelt music) Xuguang continued to give them suggestions. \"If you want to go back home, then the Sky-Faring Commission will help you. They can also recommend a place for you to stay temporarily and a job to make a living if you want to wait for that con artist to get arrested and recover your losses.\" \"How are we supposed to face our parents if we go back, and if we stay, how can we face each other...? We got cheated out of everything we have because of our own greed. It's too shameful to bear!\" Akella said, his voice quaking with emotion. Xuguang understands the heart of the matter after hearing his words. Short-life species are always so anxious about time passing them by and not accomplishing anything. Xuguang's many years of performing her duties left her unsurprised by this kind of incident. \"There's no need to worry. Keep working hard. You still have another forty years of life ahead of you. Time will help you smooth out all your conflicts.\" \"Dahao's notes: This mediation clearly exposes that many staff members of the Realm-Keeping Commission lack sufficient competency in their mediation work and don't even think about the physiological differences of different species. Offering suggestions like \"Let time solve everything.\" is not appropriate at all. All of you need to do new recruit training!\" \u00bb&gt;(Insert shifting sound effect) After hearing Xuguang's gentle words of advice, Zaman and Akella still couldn't settle their issue. Quite the opposite, they suddenly broke down into loud sobs, and things got out of control for a moment. The two insisted on dueling to the death. \u00bb&gt;(Insert an ad from sponsors) Part III. \u00bb&gt;(Video logo: Publicity Department of the Realm-Keeping Commission) Xuguang's head started to ache as she watched the two lose control of their emotions. Perhaps just then she was overflowing with confidence in her excellent negotiation skills. She did everything in her power to calm Zaman and Akella down, but now they were so overcome by emotion that they couldn't listen to her advice. \"Dahao's notes: Could you dial down the grandstanding a bit? I don't see anything excellent about the negotiation skills in this script!\" \u00bb&gt;(Insert interview of Xuguang the attendant, Zaman, and Akella) In the face of difficulty, Xuguang demonstrated the superb qualities that an attendant for the Realm-Keeping Commission ought to have: a sharp wit and the ability to adapt to change. The Foxians have a saying that goes, \"Words are more powerful than fists, but fists are more effective than words.\" \"Dahao's notes: Go to the Sky-Faring Commission and ask Madam Yukong or just grab any Foxian you can find and ask them! Foxians would never say something like this!\" \"Knock out it off! If a duel is what can bring a smile to your face, then I will allow you to duel, but you won't be dueling each other. You'll be facing me. If I win, then you have to do what I say.\" Zaman and Akella thought about the proposal for a good while. After discussing it over, the two ultimately decided to accept it. \u00bb&gt;(Insert interview of Zaman and Akella) Zaman chose to be her first opponent. He bowed and stepped to a safe distance away from Xuguang. He charged toward her aggressively with his weapon at the ready. Well-versed in how to defend herself as a woman, Xuguang pivoted away from his attack, She countered by using her fingers like a sword to strike Zaman's Shenfeng acupuncture point with stunning precision. Zaman's qi was temporarily blocked. His footwork became clumsy, and he fell to the ground immediately. The duel was ever before it even began. Akella's jaw dropped at what he had just witnessed. \"Dahao's notes: This all needs to get cut. It's a script for a publicity video. Why are you describing the fighting techniques in so much detail? Besides, do Aigaians have the same physiology as Xianzhou natives? Do they have acupuncture points?\" \u00bb&gt;(Insert interview of Zaman and Akella) Akella's eyes revealed he had accepted his fate. Perhaps because he witnessed Zaman's defeat, he didn't select any weapon other than his own two fists. The palm of Xuguang's hands faced upward. It was as if she reached out with numerous hands. She brushed aside Akella's opening strike and then hit Akella's chest with a barrage of punches to his chest. In the blink of an eye, the second duel was over. \"Dahao's notes: I get it. The author enjoys describing combat. I will rewrite this paragraph. If we released copy like this, it would cause a cultural conflict.\" Xuguang didn't wait for the two to get back up on their feet before she swiftly rushed toward them, blocking their escape. The attendant towered over them, took their hands, and ordered them to hold each other's hands tightly. \"Both of you lost to me, so the duel is over. Now I want you to become friends again!\" \u00bb&gt;(Insert Xuguang's interview) After the duel was over, Zaman and Akella were able to catch a ship back to their hometown thanks to the Sky-Faring Commission's help. As for Xuguang, her use of fighting to resolve an external conflict triggered a controversy. She was given a demerit after a discussion among the top brass of the Realm-Keeping Commission. And with that, the Realm-Keeping Commission protected the peace of Xianzhou once again. \u00bb&gt;(Play end credits) \"Dahao's notes: After giving it some thought, I've decided you should rewrite this script for me. I don't feel like doing it. If content like this were released to the public, the last shred of the Realm-Keeping Commission's reputation would be up in flames!\""}

The Amber Lord is known for THEIR indifference. THEY usually only share THEIR power with zealots, for instance, the Interastral Peace Corporation. Profile. Qlipoth strives to isolate contact between planets. The celestial-sized structures THEY'VE built \u2014 the Subspace Crystalline Barrier \u2014 separates and protects the living worlds from being devoured by their enemy. The nine initial Xianzhou ships witnessed the barrier separating the world from the endless void: the Echidna Skywall. Despite being the main faction aligned with the Amber Lord, the IPC goes against the desires of the Aeon, facilitating civilized trade and contact between the stars. No remonstration or censure has been directed towards them because of this. Appearance. Qlipoth is a legless humanoid made of rocks and minerals with a halo behind THEIR head. History. Origin. Estimated around 2158 Amber Eras ago, Qlipoth ascended to become the Aeon of The Preservation during the Dusk Wars, pledging to construct walls tirelessly to defend the universe against the Leviathans. Swarm Disaster. During the Swarm Disaster, Ena the Order sent an invitation to The Preservation, as THEY thought Qlipoth held great responsibility for the order of the universe as the one who controls the will of transmutation. An agreement was reached wherein Qlipoth promised to aid the Aeons against Tayzzyronth and The Swarm, while the contents on Ena\u2019s part of the deal remains unknown \u2014 though presumably related to Oroboros. With the same hammer THEY use for construction, THEY began to dilute Tayzzyronth's form, as Aha and Xipe watched. As Qlipoth's rage grew, the suns in the area began to grow abnormally in numbers. Within each swing, Qlipoth stripped THEM of their broken shell, body, and heart as THEIR blood and primordial eggs spilled all over the ground, further diluting THEIR power. After being reduced to fragments, Qlipoth sealed Tayzzyronth remains into separate pieces of amber. Present. During the battle of Cocolia, Mother of Deception, when the Trailblazer drew Alisa Rand's Lance, Qlipoth gazed at the Trailblazer and swung THEIR hammer, marking the start of 2158 AE. Thus, the Trailblazer acquired the Path of Preservation and managed to defeat Cocolia. Simulated Universe. When Qlipoth appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: Dev Log1. Related Entry \u2014 The Preservation ...Qlipoth the Preservation is the oldest known Aeon in the universe alongside Oroboros the Voracity. I was once very interested in Qlipoth, as the first two centuries in the Amber Era were almost completely blank. What creature is this giant rock\/amber? Where did THEY come from? How did THEY become an Aeon? And why are THEY tirelessly making a wall? There are many questions surrounding THEM, but the answers are nowhere to be found. The IPC is doing too good of a job keeping Qlipoth's information a secret. These people regard the Amber Lord as the one true god and allow not even the smallest transgression towards the Aeon. I didn't get any useful information out of the IPC. In contrast, the Intelligentsia Guild has a lot less respect for the Preservation... Dev Log2. Related Entry \u2014 The Preservation ...I don't respect the Intelligentsia Guild, but I like them. They are also followers of Erudition but have none of the arrogance and temper of the Genius Society members. They are also down-to-earth and answer honestly when asked. According to Cleo the editor, the period between AE 0 and 180 was not as much a blank as the IPC had claimed. Many archeological discoveries proved that Leviathans were still active in the early days after the Preservation ascended, which goes against the IPC's official line that \"the Dusk Wars ended with the birth of the Amber Lord.\" There is even a hypothesis that other Aeons already existed before Qlipoth did... I can tell that the IPC won't fund such research from a mile off. Using threats to withdraw funding, the IPC coerced the Astral Ecology School to give up on these archeological projects, and that's why I'm no longer interested in Qlipoth. The IPC is just too annoying... Dev Log3. Related Entry \u2014 The Preservation ...I'm curious. How did the Architects receive inspiration from their Aeon in advance to build the towering walls to resist enemies from the outside? After all, Qlipoth cares little for mortals, and observing living beings is a behavior more familiar to Ena the Order. I suppose it makes sense for these two Aeons to have communal responsibilities. After all, there is some overlap between Preservation and Order. To tell the truth, I really admire Ena. THEY exude the glory of the old empires like majestic marble, which is also somewhat similar to Qlipoth \u2014 THEY both feel similar to protector gods, albeit not entirely the same. Anyway, the fall of Tayzzyronth seems to be directly linked to the Preservation. I think only that giant hammer wrapped in divine power can penetrate the body of another god. It's just that there's so much more to history than that. I'm really struggling to ascertain the way Aeons fight..."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6635","text":"Realm-Keeping Commission  The Realm-Keeping Commission is one of the six commissions in the Xianzhou Alliance. Overview. The Realm-Keeping Commission is Xianzhou's administrative organization, and the Commission that Xianzhou residents would normally have the most contact with. The Realm-Keeping Commission is responsible for matters such as population statistics, resource allocation, and calendar timing. Some of its staff are scholars who conduct professional academic research in sociology and ecology. It is the general affairs organization of the Xianzhou, with a broad range of responsibilities including dealing with fraud, riots, criminal investigations, emergencies, and keeping up with the demands of Xianzhou citizens. As such, it is the commission which interacts with the public the most. Its Xianzhou Luofu branch office is located at the Exalting Sanctum. It was the duty of the Realm-Keeping Commission to go after Bailu when she escapes and take her back to the Alchemy Commission. Officers are managers in the Chancery, responsible for coordinating all local internal and external affairs. The main job involves going to meetings at the Realm-Keeping Commission's General Affairs Office and spreading their ideas. It is said that in regards to registering hatching rebirths, the Xianzhou Fanghu's Realm-Keeping Commission is more competent. Upon completing their hatching rebirth, a newborn Vidyadhara is immediately assigned a new residence without having to go through the standard real estate paperwork like they would with the Luofu Realm-Keeping Commission. It should be noted though that this may be a result of the Fanghu being an autonomous dominion of the Vidyadhara. Diting is used as forensic equipment by the Realm-Keeping Commission. History. Sometime in the Year 8100 Star Calendar, a Stellaron was smuggled onboard the Luofu and shortly afterwards, a stellaron burst occurred, causing many to turn into Mara-Struck Soldiers. During the crisis, the Realm-Keeping Commission was sent out in full force. The Realm-Keeping Commission General Bureau announced that Exalting Sanctum was temporarily closing its borders and navigation routes and that the details would be outlined in the official bulletin sent to their jade abacus soon. Those that felt unwell were to report to the Realm-Keeping Commission as soon as possible and doctors from the Alchemy Commission would see them free of charge. Bags of protein rice and emergency medicine would also be distributed to civilians, either collected in person or delivered to their door. Officer Dahao invited the Astral Express Crew to Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery to talk about the issues Exalting Sanctum was currently facing. The Trailblazer met with Officer Dahao and showed them a letter they found from a member of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Dahao promptly contacted the Qingzu from the Seat of Divine Foresight, stating it was beyond the Realm-Keeping Commission's jurisdiction. After the revival of the Ambrosial Arbor, the Astral Express Crew assisted Officer Dahao and Jingyan in investigating outworlder travelers who were sighted in the location specified by General Jing Yuan and Master Diviner Fu Xuan two days before the Ambrosial Arbor came back to life. They suspected Luocha and attempted to retrace his steps on the Luofu while putting together corrupted cycrane video recordings, but ultimately concluded that he had nothing to do with the incident. After Bailu escaped from the Alchemy Commission again, Dahao contacted the Trailblazer again for assistance as the Realm-Keeping Commission were short on manpower, tasking them with finding Bailu and taking care of her until the Alchemy Commission delves were reopened. Shortly after, the Trailblazer and Bailu found Orderly Guangda and took his starskiff to Cloudford. Guangda also once paid the Trailblazer to help him remove posters in Exalting Sanctum. Orderly Guangjin contacted the Trailblazer to assist with an investigation. Based on the investigation of the Realm-Keeping Commission, a few citizens had found a strange phenomenon similar to cloudhymn magic in the Alchemy Commission and Scalegorge Waterscape, and encountered invisible monsters inside the mirages. According to the statements of the witnesses, the commission came to several conclusions regarding the incident. The phenomenon and the monsters appeared simultaneously and when the mirage was gone, so did the food brought by the starskiff. As the phenomenon was similar to Vidyadhara cloudhymn magic, the orderlies used echoes to detect the location of the invisible monsters in the area. After investigating, it turned out that Warp Trotters were the ones behind the anomaly and they somehow learned to imitate cloudhymn magic."}

Trace elements pointed to three coordinates in the Consternation Starzone: The Yadav variable star; the Cerulean Nightmare; and the Knucklebone. Using the Matrix of Prescience, the master diviner predicted that it must have been plagued. The results were reported to the Xianzhou Yuque, and the prediction indeed came true. Upon investigation, the borisin Bluefang Pack had plundered everything, even trying to turn one of the worlds into a nursery for their weapons. But the Cloud Knights' Rainbow Orbit Fleet meted out punishment, enacting a famous victory. [Observational Records: Year 7954 Star Calendar] During its 6th macro-sweep of the year, the Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect traces of Reignbow's Lux Arrow nearby Laevateinn-XVI. When the Cloud Knights' Thunderclap Orbit Fleet arrived at the coordinates, the planet had been destroyed without any survivors remaining. It was categorized as a \"deadworld,\" and deleted from the astral charts. The Luofu's Artisanship Commission successfully mined embers from the Lux Arrow out of the deadworld's debris. Meanwhile, their Alchemy Commission extracted biological samples to analyze the characteristics of this plague that had infected the populace.

The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight: the Rainbow Orbit Fleet, Thunderclap Orbit Fleet, Caladrius Orbit Fleet, and Comet Orbit Fleet. The battle raged intensely and just as the Xianzhou faced defeat, Reignbow's arrow cut through the enemy. During the course of this battle, the Xianzhou Luofu lost over 63,000 fighter jets and over 120,000 pilots. Nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. \"Reignbow would never speak to any mortal... THEY only let THEIR Lux Arrow do all the talking.\""}

The Fanghu is expected to moor here for some ten Star Calendar years, unless unforeseen circumstances transpire.

Therefore, the IPC's archives preserved the complete recording of the Aeon's manifestation from the start to the end. Old Fleming was giving a speech at the time and declaring he was going to permanently retire from all official and unofficial events. Given how old he was, he was probably tired of living.

Profile. While members of the Galaxy Rangers hail from different worlds, and have all kinds of personalities and traits, each of them are highly skilled, despises evil, and follows Lan and the Path of The Hunt. They carry a balance scale with them at all times and believe justice in the universe needs to be achieved through individual deeds. They are always accompanied by the song and the sound of horns. They pursue justice for those they encounter along the way and shower them with wines and songs. According to Aventurine, the Rangers \"come and go like shadows,\" and there's little communication between them. History. Assassination of Lord Ravager Zulo. The Galaxy Rangers first rose to fame with the successful assassination of Lord Ravager Zulo, called \"Operation Zulo.\" Rather than confront him directly, the Rangers manipulated surviving members of The Swarm, making use of their lack of intelligence to their advantage and herding them toward his fleet. Before the mission, they saved the life of Breukelen Tiernan, a Nameless who battle for Penaconys independence from the Interastral Peace Corporation. He along with Loretta are so far the only two named Galaxy Rangers to battle Lord Ravager Zulo, and Tiernan disappeared soon after. Riding the success of \"Operation Zulo\", the Galaxy Rangers would next defeat the Thirteenth Legion of Gaius the Usurper, the successor of Genius Society Member #27, Emperor Rubert's will. However, their means of accomplishing this are unknown. Dr. Primitive. Many years later, the Galaxy Rangers would thwart the 64th member of the Genius Society, Dr. Primitive, and protect the Thousand-Tree Greenwood. For this, some claim that many Galaxy Rangers would suffer from Degeneration Flow and lose their combat capabilities resulting in the Galaxy Rangers having to cut back on their efforts. Dr. Primitive however took an unknown form of revenge on the Galaxy Rangers, further pushing the Galaxy Rangers into obscurity. Presently, the Galaxy Rangers and Dr. Primitive are closely intertwined, and even after his rumored death, there are still Rangers who hunt for him. Once, an individual believed to be a Galaxy Ranger sold Dr. Primitive's robes on Device IX's dark web but refused to answer any questions. The Present. While the Galaxy Rangers have fallen into a state of scarcity, they are still an active group in the universe and have appeared numerous times in recent events. Colleen recounts a story about a pirate she used to work with called Wyland, who replaced most of his body with prosthetics. After a masked visitor informed him that void song whale's brain extract could relieve Wyland of his headaches due to old age, Wyland begun to massacre void song whales. He hooked his nervous system up to his ship for maximum efficiency, and at this point the IPC reached out to the Galaxy Rangers to put a stop to him. However, when all their forces arrived Wyland was already dead. Another time, an anonymous Ranger claimed that The Cremators were behind the Holstein Aphasia in 2157 AE, in which the residents of Holstein had all their memories relating to \"language\" stolen. Recently, the Cremators were confirmed to be behind it, and the Galaxy Rangers have announced that the rangers are working on retrieving the stolen memories. At some point, a Galaxy Ranger chased a group of interstellar thieves into Talia. These thieves would later go on to create Nailscrap Town. The Self-Annihilator Acheron arrived on Penacony posing as a Galaxy Ranger, which caused Boothill, a real Galaxy Ranger, to seek her out and try to kill her. Upon meeting Acheron himself, she explains to him that given the group's elusive nature and limited contact with each other, she had to devise a plan to \"reach out\" to him. She had done so in order to fulfill a long-standing promise to return Tiernan's relics to their rightful owner. Boothill would later confront Aventurine in order to find out where Oswaldo Schneider was."}

The factions 'Memokeepers' take on the form of Memetic Entities and travel to different worlds to gather memories. Profile. As messengers for the Remembrance, Memokeepers will surrender their worldly bodies and traverse the universe in the form of memories. These forms are far more resilient then other forms of Memetic Entity, as it protects them from forgetful nature of Remembrance and the corrosion of Enigmata. Their goal is to search the stars on Fuli's behalf to find the most precious memories, and to make sure the universe is remembered in the face of the Destruction. According to Welt, Memokeepers of the Garden are Emanators. Memokeepers will travel to worlds alone, using their powers to prevent the inhabitants from knowing of their presence, only revealing themselves if they come across someone who has a potential of being a Memokeeper, after which they take them away for recruitment. Due to their allusive nature, the Garden of Recollection has gained powerful reputation and many are afraid of the faction. While many of the faction hold onto the core beliefs of Remembrance, there exists a off-shot of Memokeepers known as \"The Cremators\" who don't believe in every memory being valuable. The Cremators will destroy memories they find unimportant in order to \"clear out the garbage.\" Due to the powers granted to them, Memokeepers from the Garden of Recollection follow an extremely strict set of rules in order to ensure that their powers are not misused, having been specifically trained to resist looking into, stealing, controlling or restoring memories. Violating this rule results in their immediate termination, though a few members are given an exception to this rule. Technology. Memory Bubbles are a technology developed by the Garden of Recollection to preserve memories. The Garden created a Sentiention membrane to keep the memories wrapped up in it like a bubble, making it easy to carry memories around. Similarly, Light Cones are technology that preserve memories created by the Garden, but on a more advanced scale. Because they also preserve experiences and abilities, this technology is under level-2 restriction by the Interastral Peace Corporation. The memories contained in Light Cones become clearer when infused with substances such as Sparse Aether, Condensed Aether and Refined Aether. History. The earliest mention of the Garden of Recollection is following the Swarm Disaster and invention of the Synesthesia Beacon, during that time the Interastral Peace Corporation terminated it's existing contract with the Garden to make way for the new technology. When Boothill received a new body to begin his hunt against Oswaldo Schneider, who ordered a genocide on his people, he broke into a local Garden of Recollection branch to find memories related to his homeworld. He unintentional destroyed multiple Memory Bubbles in the process and the Memokeepers scrambled to recover as much rare and precious memories as possible before kicking him out. In the end, Boothill still managed to learn about Oswaldo Schneider, and the Garden of Recollection still hold animosity towards him, even believing Boothill to be responsible for the Holstein Aphasia. After learning of the Trailblazer's existence, the Garden of Recollection took an interest in them, due to their ability to hold a Stellaron and were curious to see how they would influence the universe."}

September 7 I was wandering around the Exalting Sanctum today, and I saw a foreign Balladian peddling along the street. I went up and found out they were selling pets. The animal I saw looked like a house cat, but its body was much smaller. It was lying down on a mat in a bamboo cage, purring and meowing affectionately. However, after the Ambrosial Arbor took root, most of the Xianzhou people preferred large and strong pets. I asked the Balladian why this animal was so small, and if anyone had shown interest in buying it. The person responded that it is true that Xianzhou people like large and strong pets, but there are also those who love petite and delicate ones. Now that he saw the sparkle in my eyes, he expected that I must be the latter. Perhaps it was fate? I couldn't refuse. The person also said that this small animal is called a grimalkin, and it was one of the species that the ancestors of Xianzhou loved to keep during the Primeval Imperium Era. Today, the strong Xianzhou house cat evolved from this small grimalkin. This was in line with what I'd read in old texts. However, the grimalkin had been extinct for many years. This made me suspicious, and I inquired about its origin. The person swore to me that though grimalkins were extinct in Xianzhou, they were bred on many other planets. This animal is truly just an ordinary white grimalkin. It was neither genetically modified, nor was it an invasive species, so I could rest assured. How could I turn down looking after a long-extinct little animal to help continue its lineage \u2014 especially after petting those tender little paws? Eventually, I paid hefty sum for the grimalkin, named it \"Mimi,\" and took it home. Only that I'm too busy with official business and have little time to take care of Mimi. After thinking it over, chores like feeding it and changing its water should also be entrusted to Qingzu. Part II. December 22 Mimi is getting bigger and bigger, and becoming more and more attached. It's also very intelligent. Mimi's soft, snow-like fur flows like the clouds, and its nine ridged tail has a big ball of fuzz at the end. Mimi's round, full, and blue irises possess radiating patterns like cracks over ice. Their colors are rich, charming, and dignified. However, Mimi's appetite is strangely large. Is it really a grimalkin? I thought to myself that the name \"Mimi\" might not be too appropriate at this point. Qingzu told me the other day that she had purchased catties worth of meat for the Seat of Divine Foresight's meals in the past week, but Mimi wiped it all clean. The story did not end there. She also said that this has become the gossip of the town, and the rumors have it that the general has been neglecting his duties and indulging in gluttony instead. This has gotten the people all riled up. Qingzu was worried that could be bad for me, but I didn't think too much of it and told her not to worry. In my opinion, \"The Glutton General\" sounds more impressive than \"The Dozing General.\" Part III. January 19 The food expenses are gradually becoming unsustainable. I thought that there must be some way to deal with this, so I brought in a healer from the Alchemy Commission to check on Wave-Treading Snow Lion (sorry, Qingzu, I'm horrible at naming). The healer's consultation was fruitless, instead suggesting we try some genetic testing. I agreed. The results were in line with its food intake \u2014 as expected, it was not a grimalkin after all, let alone an ordinary house cat. It was a lion. Hence the name change to from Mimi to Wave-Treading Snow Lion. However, this fact did not affect its usual grimalkin-like behavior. Whenever Snow Lion is free (it usually is), it either scratches the silk curtains or rips the felt, or engorges itself on its specially-prepared schizonepeta. Of course, Qingzu's effort can't be overstated. She's really trained it well, but sometimes it unfortunately gets in the way of official business. All that aside, the top priority now should be to find ways to reduce the food expenditure. I'm afraid this will take some time to figure it out."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=27364","text":"Giovanna's Work Diary Giovanna's Work Diary is a readable found on Penacony. Text. X\/23 Something strange happened today. Early in the morning, an alarm came through about an abnormality in a dream device installed in one of the rooms. The hotel immediately sent people to investigate and, after no answer was gained for quite some time, security personnel opened the door \u2014 only to find the room empty, with just a wide-open dream device operating by itself. We then launched an emergency search throughout the hotel, even asking people to confirm the status of the missing guest in the Dreamscape. Fortunately, nothing was wrong with this guest inside the Dreamscape. So, at least for now, his body seems undamaged and his mind remains within Penacony. To protect the guest's mental well-being, we will not inform them for now. To address this, the hotel has dispatched a team to conduct close follow-up observations on the guest. We hope that his body can be found soon. X\/25 There have been some... rumors around the hotel these days. I first caught wind in the tearoom: A maid said she could hear a rustling scratchy voice when passing by \"that room\" in the middle of the night \u2014 like a rat nibbling on wallpaper. But how could Penacony have rats? Even the kitchenhands started to talk about this later. Apparently, another young waiter sneaked into \"that room\" again, and it really was empty inside. But after that, the sound still kept appearing. And it got louder... and louder. X\/26 Finally, I heard it myself \u2014 the sound they'd been talking about. The three hours I spent waiting outside that door wasn't in vain, after all. I slipped in before the sound disappeared. Everyone has been getting antsy recently because of that rumor about \"the guest who got eaten by the dream device and turned into a wandering specter.\" As the head nurse, it is my duty to clarify this ridiculous delusion. It was a scratchy sound. It rustled like a rat nibbling at the wallpaper, or like an angry ghost struggling. I looked back to see the guest room door was still open. The sound came from behind the wardrobe over in the corner of the room, so I took a few steps over, and the sound got louder. I paused for a second, then I tried to call for him: \"Mr. Sealy?\" Then I heard a loud, rasping laugh. That sound... it was strange, more like an off-tune weak scream or a painful whimper instead of laughter. I felt my vision going dark and my body freezing. But the sound drifted off after a while, so I bravely took another few steps forward and called out again. However, that sound suddenly stopped. At that time, my curiosity got the better of me and I leaned over the wardrobe to peer behind it into the gap between it and the wall \u2014 I saw a large pair of bloodshot eyes and a set of wriggling white teeth that was both terrifying and sinister. And then, I heard a weak, breathy roar saying: \"Sa\u2014Save me!\" X\/28 This morning, the hotel issued a revised guest guideline and dreaming regulations. What happened to Mr. Sealy gave us all a wake-up call to recognize the flaws and oversights in our original workflow. For this purpose, we have made the following improvements: 1. Guests with any history of sleepwalking will have additional limb support measures taken while entering the dream to prevent accidents from occurring during sleep. 2. The layout of hotel rooms has been optimized to prevent smaller guests (such as the Pepeshi) from getting stuck between any furniture again. As for poor Mr. Sealy, the mental trauma he suffered seems to exceed any weakness caused by dehydration and hunger. The hotel pledges to provide him with the best recuperating environment and the most meticulous care. We sincerely hope he will make a speedy recovery."}

Unlike the High Elders of other Xianzhou ships, who are limited to governing over Vidyadhara affairs, on the Fanghu the Glaciator Marum governs all citizens, and the Six Charioteers and Six Commissions support the High Elder. It is because of their influence that the Pearlkeepers aboard the Fanghu formed an elite force that have basically replaced the role of the Cloud Knights there. History. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Xianzhou Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara, and the five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. Glaciator Marum was bound to watch over the Miniature Myriads on the Fanghu. As a reward, the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Xianzhou Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship. The Glaciator Marum was once supported by the Pearlkeeper Liu Hua for the first three hundred years of his life who also became the head healer that closely served her for the last four hundred years of his life. Liu Hua later became known as a medical scientist and his \"Medical Compendium\" became the foundation of the Xianzhou Alliance's modern medicine. After the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae in the Year 7379 Star Calendar, a Preceptor of Glaciator Marum advised her to unleash her wrath and impose punishment on his peers who instructed the sedition on the Xianzhou Luofu. In response, she coldly told him \u201cIn that case, how about I send you to read out the sentence? Just you. Alone.\u201d The Preceptor was effectively banished to the Luofu. On the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of Ketu Mirage; the roaming star and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight but they were still facing defeat. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. Ever since the third Abundance War, the Fanghu had adopted self-preservation policies to recuperate. As a result, they had had cut off most of their regular communications and trade with the other Xianzhou ships, a decision from the Glaciator Marum, implicitly stemming from the Vidyadhara's inability to produce offspring. After the new travel policy was put into place, the ship opened up to visitors once more."}

Colonies were scattered, and the iron fleet fell one after another. Besieged by the Swarm, the cries of the people of Glamoth were drowned out by despair, and the Welkin Empire was shattered from then on.

Text. \"Inquiry Into The Gods: An Introduction\". The Diviner's art lies in surveying the past to predict the future. Humans walk the Paths, while stars cross the sky: Observing these situations can produce future predictions. All of this is based on the diviner's ascertainment of the present situation (or the past, because the present is constantly becoming the past). However, the founder of the Divination Commission system, Master Xuan Yao, said, \"Only the universe and the Aeons cannot be foretold.\" In her opinion, the universe and the Aeons it birthed are utterly beyond prediction. The reasoning is simple: Nobody can observe the universe from all angles at once and predict the future. Omniscience is unattainable. Putting aside the universe, those known as Aeons are also extremely powerful due to THEIR various complex elements. THEIR future is like that of the universe itself, and beyond the ability of our calculations. From the perspective of a celestial body, an Aeon is by no means dead but rather a living creature with a transcendent mind. But viewed from the perspective of a living creature, the Aeons fill the skies like celestial bodies themselves. They are incomparably huge, move according to their own Path, and rarely communicate with mortals like us. Based on observational records, Master Xuan Yao has sorted all known Aeons into three categories: Arbiters: Determining mortal births and deaths, which are highly connected to the rise and fall of civilizations.The Sacrosancts: Difficult to predict as good or evil; often unable to even know where they head for.The Authors of Calamity: The main culprit behind all disasters. Avoid, or be annihilated. The Aeons currently known to us are: \"Inquiry Into The Gods: The Arbiters\". Lord of the Path of The Hunt. We know them as Lan, god of the Skybow. THEY rarely appear before mortals, and the only portents of THEIR presence are vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky. Reignbow tirelessly hunts the undead abominations created by Yaoshi the Abundance. Reignbow Arbiter first appeared around Year 3400 Star Calendar with their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow severing Abundance's Ambrosial Arbor. Since then, the Xianzhou natives had risen out of chaos, madness, and decline. This also marked the formation of the Alliance. To this day, one of the chief duties of the Divination Commission is to monitor the decree of Reignbow's arrow and interpret its meaning. Lord of the Path of Preservation. Also known as the Amber Lord; and as Qlipoth, god of the skywall by the Interastral Peace Corporation. Observational records suggest that the Amber Lord strives to isolate contact between planets. The celestial-sized structures built \u2014 the Subspace Crystalline Barrier \u2014 separates and protects all worlds. Based on records from around Year 1000 SC, the nine initial Xianzhou ships first set sail on their arduous journey and witnessed the almighty barrier separating the world from the endless void: the Echidna Skywall. But contrary to the act of separation, the main faction devoted to the Amber Lord, the IPC, has facilitated civilized trade and contact between the stars with their fleet \u2014 the largest in the entire universe. Like a silent giant, Qlipoth has allowed them to trade and emigrate so much so that an Emanator of Preservation has appeared at the IPC. Despite their actions running counter to the Aeon's wishes, no remonstration or censure has been forthcoming. Food for thought, indeed. \"Inquiry Into The Gods: The Sacrosancts\". Lord of the Path of Erudition. Known as Nous, the god of intellect by the Genius Society and Intelligentsia Guild. None can comprehend Nous' intentions, location, or normal state. People merely spread word of a magnificent machine intelligence that has been upgraded into an Aeon, calculating the essence of the universe and its ultimate solution. Before the answer is disclosed, THEY will summon all of the greatest minds in the universe together to examine and discuss results. I myself have had the honor to witness the divine corpus of Nous, and thus may be able to add a few more comments here. Contrary to standard thinking, Nous is not a god that provides solutions. On the contrary, all THEY offer is an infinite number of questions. Many people spend their whole lives walking through a fog of ignorance, eager for knowledge but unable to find a proper approach. THEY are hindered by things such as \"precedents\" and \"knowledge.\" Visiting Nous is enough to open the eyes of even the most ignorant people, to see the problem. But the answer may only be found by oneself. The dauntless scholars of the Divination Commission can follow the example of great scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild by stepping on \"the road to opening one's eyes.\" If fate is predestined, the counsel of Nous must be sought. Lord of the Path of Trailblaze. Known by the Nameless as Akivili, god of roaming. Only several unverifiable legends about the Cloudstrider remain. For the Xianzhou people, the word \"legend\" connotes images of an unfathomably ancient time. Since the first epoch of the Amber Era, Akivili has sped through the wild worlds of the cosmos. It's precisely because of the Nameless' and THEIR existence that those isolated worlds scattered throughout the dark cosmos are able to know each other. The Cloudstrider's most important miracles have been creating the \"chromatic echelon\" and \"star rail.\" Legend has it that the chromatic echelon is a key component of laying the star rail network, and the star rail itself can connect distant galaxies by means of a mysterious mechanism. Be it the Interastral Peace Corporation or the Xianzhou, the safe routes we all rely upon today all follow remnants of these star tracks. If Akivili had never fallen, it's hard to imagine what contact between the planets would be like today. Based on the Xianzhou Yuque's latest intel, the Cloudstrider's chromatic echelon has reappeared after thousands of years. Abominations run rampant, and the Legion ravages the people... In these troubled times, what can the Nameless bring to the cosmos? I can scarcely imagine. Lord of the Path of Elation. Known by the Masked Fools and Mourning Actors as Aha, god of tricksters. If we lay out a spectrum from \"Mortal\" to \"Aeon\" based on an Aeon's modus operandi, then Aha is an Aeon who is closer to the mortal end of things. THEY play with the love, hate, joy, and sorrow of intelligent creatures to subvert and shift fate \u2014 as THEIR followers put it, THEY enjoy this and even manifest in human form sometimes to catalyze the change. It would be wrong to assume that the Joyseeker is a jester among the Aeons. Yes, THEY can't really perform earth-shattering miracles like the Reignbow Arbiter or the Firmamend Arbiter. However, by using THEIR invisible hand, THEY can imperceptibly influence the movements of all living things. This demonstrates an extraordinary and delicate manipulation of reality. For example, during Emperor Rubert's campaign, Aha's believers kicked off another riot after the Philosopher Union was reduced to the domain of inorganic life, infecting the conqueror's computer systems with another troll virus called the \"Philosopher's Poison\" and overthrowing the local robot army. Similar miracles abound, and tiny ripples eventually become a tsunami that can shake the whole world \u2014 this is Aha's style. Lord of the Path of Beauty. Known as Idrila, god of beauty by the Knights of Beauty and the Mirror Holders. Known on some worlds as Anne Duray. So far, the Knights of Beauty have been disbanded, leaving the Mirror Holders to wander the stars, searching for THEIR holy relics. All of this serves as proof that THEY have fallen. But my documents exchanged with the Intelligentsia Guild mention: If the relics of the Wondergazer can be found intact, THEIR beautiful countenance will be able to reappear. According to ancient myth, Idrila once attributed the beauty of all the starzones to THEMSELF, showing heroes, villains, and mortals the meaning and aesthetics contained within the cosmic landscape, and driving them to complete astonishing (but often devastating) achievements for Idrila's own pleasure. This myth may reveal the true meaning behind the Path of Beauty: The integration of consciousness, insight, and values. \"Inquiry Into The Gods: The Authors of Calamity\". Ruler of the Path of Abundance. Our greatest nemesis. The Denizens of Abundance and the Xianzhou Alliance know them as Yaoshi, the god of life. In short, you diviners must have read about the myth of THEM manifesting aboard the Luofu to leave behind the Ambrosial Arbor. Perhaps you've heard about that while studying in the lyceum, serving in the Cloud Knights, or reading novels. There is no need for this book to devote pages to it. It is worth reiterating to everyone once more that any action involving predicting the Plagues Author's fate are viewed as an unforgivable felony. I know that diviners suffer from hubris during their first hundred years of practice, sinking into a form of madness gained from possessing extraordinary knowledge. They would believe they can now control destiny, that they literally have the power to decipher the entire world. They would be deluded to the point of ignoring the ban on running divinations on Aeons, and try learning the secrets of ancient works. A blind eye can be turned if a diviner tries to predict the fate of other Aeons. However, the Ten-Lords Commission has issued a ban on predicting Yaoshi's fate, listing it as a crime equal to the Ten Unpardonable Sins and promising strict punishment \u2014 that is, if you are even still alive after your transgression. The Plagues Author is the reason the Xianzhou natives became a long-life species. There is therefore some sort of undefinable and remote connection between us and Yaoshi. This kind of connection cannot yet be explained by physics, and may be one of the causes of mara. Moreover, anyone trying to peer at Yaoshi by means of divination will suffer a similar backlash. Every instance of such actions so far has led to tragic results. These records are filed away under \"Violations\" at the Divination Commission's repository. Diviners, please study them carefully. Ruler of the Path of Destruction. Known as Nanook, god of destruction, by the Antimatter Legion and Annihilation Gang. Despite being the most recently ascended Aeon, Nanook and THEIR minions may already be considered the greatest menace in all the cosmos. In contrast to how the healing forces of the Plagues Author brought about mutation and destructive results, the Ruin Author causes chaos in a far more direct way. THEY and THEIR Emanators lead the Antimatter Legion on their march to invade all civilized worlds, turning these planets to ashes. Despite following the Reignbow Arbiter's edict to hunt down Abundance and out-of-control abominations, the Alliance has also fought tens of thousands of skirmishes against the Legion. Our scout's reports begin to often lack news from planets that have established civil relations with the Xianzhou. All of this is drastically worrying. Perhaps, in the near future, the abominations won't be the only nemesis that Xianzhou has to face. Ruler of the Path of Propagation. Known by the IPC and other victimized planets as Tayzzyronth, god of proliferation. Known on some worlds as the Imperator Insectorum. Despite the Imperator Insectorum's early demise, THEY've cast a shadow of terror on the universe no less than that of Emperor Rubert's. The Alchemy Commission has collected from many planets unique bio-contaminant samples, which are the swarm's evolved genes known as \"propagation vector.\" The Armed Archaeologists from the Intelligentsia Guild have provided even more evidence that stars seeded by the Swarm Author have irreparably become literal hellscapes, and their only end lies in obliteration by star destroyer arsenals to prevent future danger. According to the scholar, such horrors have not completely disappeared. The Imperator Insectorum's descendants remain, and THEY could return at any moment. This scholar once showed me his collection \u2014 A dull yellow piece of amber with moving flecks and a buzzing tremor. I was absolutely gob-smacked to hear him say that it is part of the \"Imperator Insectorum's Prison Cell.\" The omniscia implanted in my forehead could not see the future of this item, which only serves to corroborate the scholar's claims. All I can do is pray in silence to the Reignbow that such a day will not come soon."}

Gopher Wood was the former Head of the Oak Family, and later became the Dreammaster of The Family's Penacony chapter. Despite his position as a Family leader, he is secretly a Pathstrider of the Order. He has two adoptive children: Sunday and Robin. He is the basis for the cartoon character Old Man Wood. With two of the Nameless gone (Razalina and Tiernan), the Watchmaker had to go to the front lines in Penacony. It was at that moment his rivals saw an opportunity. By the time Gopher Wood the representative from the Montour system's Family arrived at the Watchmaker's call, the Stellaron had already been activated and was seeping into the primordial Synesthesia Dreamscape. The Family knew far more about the Stellaron than the average person. They helped the Watchmaker swiftly quell the civil unrest and played a part in building Penacony, under the disguise of the Harmony. Those three Amber Eras were known as the Age of Dreaming. The Watchmaker, who had been left in the dark, sent out invitations across the universe, spreading the hype around the land of the dreams. However, the Stellaron was never truly sealed by The Family. It existed in a different form within the Dreamscape: the Penacony Grand Theater itself. The opulent dream is built upon the decay of spirits, with a toxic elixir called \"pleasure\" flowing through the Dreamscape. It tempts people to indulge in the Dreamscape, and gradually their minds succumb, becoming nourishment for the sweet dream. Weaknesses that plague humanity were magnified and nourished by The Family. Penacony became a new kind of prison, even more impenetrable than the previous one. Sadly, the Watchmaker realized this far too late. By then, The Family had a firm grip on Penacony, swiftly quelling any opposition that arose. Story. Civil Unrest. When Gopher Wood first arrived in Penacony, he was described as a kind person and a gentleman by the Watchmaker. During the period when the Watchmaker went to the front lines, the townsfolk had a dispute with Gopher Wood, but he forgave the townsfolk for their transgressions and silently resumed his work. The Watchmaker noticed that people were beginning to dislike Gopher Wood, so he held a lecture\/grand banquet for Gopher Wood, and the Alfalfa Family became friends with Gopher Wood. According to \"Clockie: Dreamjoy Memoir\" \u2014 \"Dreammyth Escapade\", \"Grandpa Pine\" hired \"Banana Assassin\" to assassinate Gopher Wood. With the help of the Watchmaker, the Alfalfa Family and the Bloodhound Family, the nefarious townsfolk were all arrested and brought to justice. Gopher Wood forgave the townsfolk who framed him and was willing to accept them as his helpers. As Gopher Wood's reputation ascended, the Watchmaker's faith in this friend similarly grew stronger. It is unknown who were the basis for Grandpa Pine and Banana Assassin in the cartoon. After the fall of the traitor, the Watchmaker proposed the idea of inviting more Dreamchasers from the Cosmos to aid in the development effort, and Gopher Wood agreed. The population in Penacony began to grow. Gopher Wood diligently listened to various reports remotely and approved each new regulation that emerged. The Watchmaker recognized his duty and stepped forward to assist Gopher Wood in governing Penacony. Soon, the Watchmaker realized that he was not suitable for this job. His sense of responsibility causes a lot of trouble for Gopher Wood. As Penacony developed, the land was divided into individual private territories. The Dreamchaser rebels within the territory no longer heeded the jurisdiction of Gopher Wood. The rebels often fought for the ownership of the territory, to the extent of going against Gopher Wood. Complaints swarmed toward the heart of the town like snowflakes, and Gopher Wood finally decided to act and discipline these rebels. He then sent out the guards to arrest the disobedient Dreamchasers and educated them. The Watchmaker suggested to Gopher Wood that they should devise a plan to reclaim their lands and unify Penacony. The Watchmaker began to negotiate with the rebels and find a way to reconcile. However, the contradictions between the two factions could not be resolved overnight. To seize the most fertile land in the desert, the rebels got into a violent conflict with Gopher Wood's guards. Asna, Head of the Iris Family, embarked on her concert tour through the wasteland, singing songs of peace to quell both factions' anger. Unfortunately, along the way, she encountered the lingering remnants of monsters and was killed. Neither the rebels nor Gopher Wood rescued her, and they blamed each other for it. The rebel boss began to recruit soldiers, gearing up for an imminent large-scape battle. Mercenaries from the Cosmos could be seen marching toward the desert. Gopher Wood preemptively investigated the rebels' movements and got rid of their mercenaries. To counter Gopher Wood, the rebel boss planted explosives in his home. Unfortunately, Gopher Wood failed to detect anything amiss and unknowingly entered the house. His house collapsed in explosion. Glaux and the Nightingale Family managed to rescued him, but his wings were severed in the explosion. Seeing how badly wounded Gopher Wood was, the Watchmaker felt remorseful. Sensing his inability to make significant decisions in town, the Watchmaker no longer wanted to hold back Gopher Wood and quietly vanished. Gopher Wood could no longer tolerate the rebels. To ensure the welfare of the remaining townsfolk, he ventured into the desert alone and confronted the rebels, extending countless \"branches\" as he showed no mercy in using his power. In the end, the rebels were apprehended and chased out of Penacony by Gopher Wood. And for those who surrendered, he accepted them as new generations of townsfolk. Since then, the Dreamchasers and the townsfolk have united as one. While Penacony reunited with the new lands, the Watchmaker had reappeared before Gopher Wood. Unity of the Five Major Lineages. In 2151 AE, the long-prepared Dreamweaving Project had officially launched. The Twelve Dreamscapes were slated to be completed within this Amber Era. As construction of the Twelve Dreamscapes was almost near its end, the Oak Family Head Gopher Wood declared the \"unity of the five major lineages.\" Glaux and the Nightingale Family initially refused to join The Family. However, their members were brutally treated by the Hounds from the Bloodhound Family. Under pressure, Glaux retired and Fischer succeeded the Head. The Nightingale Family eventually joined the Family, and the Paperfold Acadamy has been kept to protect the Dreamweavers better. Dreamburn Riots. As construction of the Twelve Dreamscapes was completed, Gopher Wood was pleased with the result. Seeing Penacony developing into a wealthy and bustling place, the IPC surprisingly extended an olive branch to Penacony, and Gopher Wood accepted the IPC's offer to make peace for the time being. More and more tourists flocked to the town and formed the majority of the population of Penacony. Unwilling to live by the rules set by the old townsfolk like Gopher Wood, they demanded to get involved in the town management every day. To maintain peace in Penacony, Gopher Wood stood his ground and rejected the request. The newcomers left disgruntled and started wreaking havoc in the streets. Realizing their efforts were in vain, the rebels decided to show Gopher Wood their might, which is known as the \"Dreamburn Riots.\" The rebels brought monsters from outside into the town, leaving the streets in pandemonium. The Bloodhound Family all rushed out to the streets to maintain order. The rebels \"sprinkled poison all over the flower fields\" (presumably referring to Sweet Dreams Troupe), causing the \"flowers\" to \"grow scary thorns\" (presumably referring to Dreamjolt Troupe) that started hurting the innocent. Maeven Ellis, Head of the Iris Family, put herself before the townsfolk. She tried awakening the \"unruly flowers\", but their thorns hurt her left eye. The Watchmaker hurried to the chaotic streets only to find everything ablaze. As nobody was guarding the The Reverie Hotel, the rebels set the Hotel on fire. To rescue people in the Hotel, Gopher Wood entered the Hotel and his body was immolated. This historical event would be written as the play \"Night of Burning Dreams\". Without his physical body, Gopher Wood had to possess ravens or other Oak Family members to appear in public. Conflicts with the Watchmaker. Gopher Wood became a man of few words after the Dreamburn Riots. He stopped discussing Penacony's future with the Watchmaker anymore. Instead, he started implementing changes to the town alone. The Watchmaker reconnected with his old friends in other Family lineages, hoping to make them see Gopher Wood's mistake, but he got no support. The Watchmaker made his way to Dewlight Pavillion, hoping to have a chat with Gopher Wood, but Gopher Wood did not respond to the Watchmaker's confrontation. The Watchmaker returned to the abandoned Dreamflux Reef and revamped it with the help of Gallagher, Micah and Orla. Gopher Wood found out about Dreamflux Reef and issued the Watchmaker a warning. The population of Dreamflux Reef was growing, but Gopher Wood's influence kept encroaching the village's borders. Due to the worsening living conditions, many chose to return to Penacony. As the Watchmaker dug deeper into Penacony's secrets, he found out that Gopher Wood was stealing everyone's emotions to repair the collapsing Dreamscape. The Watchmaker came up with a great idea: they would organize a festival, using the \"Watchmaker's Legacy\" as a facade, and send invitations to the entire Cosmos to gather people and fight against The Family. He asked Gallagher to make sure to send an invitation to the Astral Express, so he can leave the true legacy for the Express. Gallagher would execute the plan during the Charmony Festival in the first year of 2158 AE. Resurrecting the Order. Sunday and Robin became orphans after a Stellaron descended upon their hometown. They were adopted by The Family when they came to help. Gopher Wood recognized their potential as \"twins of the Order\" and brought them to Penacony. In Gopher Wood's plan, Robin was supposed to be the Chordmaster of the Charmony Festival in 2158 AE, so they could seize the power of the Harmony and resurrect Ena the Order by controlling Dominicus with the 107,336 souls of the Oak Family. After Sunday succeeded the Oak Family Head, the ravens possessed by Gopher Wood acted as Sunday's Servant to monitor the Dreamscape. After Acheron slashed in Clock Studios Theme Park, Gopher Wood possessed other Family members to confront Acheron. He recognized her identity as a Self-Annihilator of Nihility and asked her to leave Penacony, and she followed his request. Acheron judged that The Family wanted to avoid the risk from her because she's rarely affected by the power of other Paths but somehow she can unconsciously infiltrate The Family. Later, she shared this information with Black Swan, Dan Heng and Boothill on the Astral Express. When Sunday and Robin met in Dreamflux Reef and learned that Gopher Wood was the suspect who employed the Stellaron's power, Robin gave up her role as the Chordmaster. The twins and Welt confronted Gopher Wood in Golden Hour. During the negotiation, Gopher Wood asked Sunday to beseech THEM to cast THEIR light unto him and question him in THEIR stead, so that no lies may be concealed, and Sunday did as commanded. However, Welt pointed out that the Aeon Gopher Wood and Sunday both mentioned were not Xipe but Ena. As their secrets of the Order were exposed, Gopher Wood asked Sunday to put Welt and Robin to sleep. However, Welt kept Aventurine's Token on himself, which was actually an IPC miniature transmitter to track the wielder's location or contact the wielder when needed. Before being put to sleep, Welt used the transmitter to send a message to the IPC. 3 system hours before the Charmony Festival began, Gopher Wood realized that Welt used the transmitter, so their secrets of the Order had spread like wildfire within The Family, and IPC starships were gathering towards Asdana. Then, Sunday betrayed Gopher Wood and was willing to sacrifice himself for Robin. Still, Sunday's betrayal was also part of Gopher Wood's plan. Sunday finally asked why Gopher Wood chose to bring the Order to Penacony instead of a desperate world. Gopher Wood answered that it's for justice and not to make the same mistake as the Harmony did. Sunday thought that Gopher Wood was not the one who manipulated the Dreamscape with the Stellaron, but Gopher Wood ended the conversation abruptly. Then, all of his possessed ravens collapsed and had no response. Gopher Wood presumably died after Sunday's final question, but it is not confirmed, and the cause of his death is unknown if it's true."}

Text. \"*Due to being hung over the counter and was continually exposed to cooking fumes, the edges of the paper have been stained with oil sprays.*\" I'm planning to develop some new dishes. If you have any ideas, let me know. \u2014 Gertie New Item of the Week: Wild Herb Soup Customer Comments: 1. It looks kind of bad. It's all goopy and stuff, so it turned me off a bit. \u2014 Don 2. It's called \"Wild Herb\" soup, but it's actually moss from the cave. The texture is refreshingly nice! The moss is cooked to the point of melting-in-your-mouth, and it took on the broth's sweet-and-sour taste. It's hearty but not heavy, such a wonderful palate cleanser. I do agree with the comment above though. Maybe change the name, or other customers may complain. \u2014 Saunders Chef's Response: Understood. I'm okay as long as it's taste is good. I'll think of a new name, but because the moss supply is not stable, I'm not even sure I want to put it on the menu. New Item of the Week: Iron Pot Braised Olm Customer Comments: 1. Did you get the iron pot from some decommissioned machines? It's cleaned, but some parts of the edge is a little rusty, it kills my appetite a little. \u2014 Don 2. I can't blame Don for being fussy, the gravy was nicely done, but I got burned a few times by the metal while trying to eat it. Gertie, is there a reason you insisted on using the iron pot? Please consider switching to a different container. \u2014 Saunders Chef's Response: I apologize. I recently read in an old cookbook that \"iron pots are perfect for simmered soups and stewed dishes because they can maximize the deliciousness of the food itself.\" Let me think on how to improve on it, I'm so sorry that it burned you. New Item of the Week: Improved Iron Pot Braised Olm Customer Comments: 1. The addition of crust is interesting, makes the tin can look much classier. Gertie, will you decorate the crust? \u2014 Don 2. Is that crust added on top of the iron pot? The only weak spot of the dish has now become its feature! The crust is warmed by the residual heat until it is crispy, coupled with the tender Olm meat, dipped into the gravy in the pot. I daresay this can be the restaurant's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance just from this little tweak! \u2014 Saunders Chef's Comment: Don, stop asking, I said no! Even if you ask me ten thousand times, I will not decorate the crust! Saunders, thank you for your constructive criticism. If it wasn't for you, I might not have realized the overheating issue with the pot. This dish will start being on the menu tomorrow onward. If you're coming over to eat, it's on the house, no worries! New Item of the Week: Candied Mushrooms with Pepper Customer Comments: 1. Appetizing but not filling enough. It's not even large enough to get stuck in my tooth gap. I had to go home and have about six pieces of rye bread. \u2014 Don 2. It's a cold dish, this is unusual. The roasted candied mushroom paired with the hammer pepper flakes makes the sensations come in layers. The spice kicks in just as the sweetness fades. As an appetizer, its portion looked a little small, I finished it before I noticed. \u2014 Saunders Is there a non-spicy version? It tastes great, but I don't do well with spicy food *sobs* . \u2014 Elaine Chef's Response: A non-spicy version? I have yet to find a replacement for hammer peppers, so I'm sorry but I probably won't be able to make it on short notice. Only the spicy version will be on the menu two days from now. As for Don, if your tooth gap is so wide, I advise you to have your teeth looked at. New Item of the Week: Rat Jelly Customer Comments: 1. Meat jelly, my childhood favorite! But is it possible to not say \"rat\" in the name of the dish itself? I'm a little squeamish, I worry my childhood favorite will become my childhood trauma. \u2014 Don 2. Jelly can be considered a featured dish only locals would know of. The Mad Mole meat doesn't taste gamey at all. Mixed in with minced garlic, there's something indescribably satisfying in having my mouth stuffed full of meat. The yogurt dip is soft and airy, and at the same time not too creamy, making it taste way better than the traditional fish jelly. \u2014 Saunders 3. As expected of Chef Gertie! This reminds me of the era when each and every family makes their own meat jelly. \u2014 Elaine Chef's Response: I'll change the name to Flavorful Jelly then. Putting on the menu next week onward. New Item of the Week: Grilled Mushrooms Customer Comments: 1. Gertie, you have been toeing the line in your pursuit for ingredient freshness. There's a reason why the mushrooms on the market have always been those few species. The ones you're using are all inedible. \u2014 Saunders 2. I have never seen mushrooms this colorful, can they really be eaten? \u2014 Antonia 3. The portion is quite filling and the taste is okay, but it will cause diarrhea after eating, it's quite a challenge for the customer's digestive system. \u2014 Don Chef's Response: Really? I apologize, I hope everyone's doing okay... New Item of the Week: Deep-Fried Rock Crab Customer Comments: 1. Rock Crabs themselves are extremely tasty, but are not suitable for deep-frying, which makes it difficult to bite into the shell. I had to smash it with a rock to get the meat inside the pincers. \u2014 Saunders 2. Gertie, are you not able to clean out the gravel on the crab? The tiny rocks coated the shell and are pretty much indistinguishable from the shell after deep-frying, it almost cracked my teeth while eating. \u2014 Antonia Chef's Response: The seller told me not to wash it too well, or some of the freshness would be lost when cooking it. I have yet to master the balance of this, so I do give my apologies, however late it may be."}

Field Company Sergeant Jaeger, who came from a family of hunters, was skilled at making fur cloaks from direwolf manes. However, after the onset of the Eternal Freeze, he rarely saw these ferocious animals.

Sergeant Jaeger would often stuff the processed wolf mane into the soldiers' silver greaves to alleviate the pain during their long march on foot. \"The direwolves haven't completely lost their home, just like us,\" Sergeant Jaeger thus lamented the plight the direwolves."}

An old-fashioned Silvermane Guard uniform passed down for generations in the Goethe family. This uniform has long been buried at the bottom of a chest, and only a soldier's honor might be worthy of its return to the world. As the soldiers of the Destruction marched ever closer, the Silvermane Guards swore to defend the last barrier even when there was no possibility of a retreat. During the Defense of Vevalo, Horace Goethe led his squad in the months-long defense of a key mountain pass. When the trumpets of arriving reinforcements finally sounded in the valley, that valiant company of heroes was long gone, and even their remains were nowhere to be found. At the commendation ceremony, Supreme Guardian Alisa pinned a medal of honor on Horace Goethe's young son. The boy stood upright in this old-fashioned uniform, representing those who had made the ultimate sacrifice. The young Goethe junior saw uniforms and medals on that day, but the Supreme Guardian saw so much more. She witnessed the greatest legacy left behind by heroes \u2014 the future of Belobog. \"Horace Goethe was a true warrior. You should be proud to bear the Goethe name.\" This was the young Goethe's only memory of the Supreme Guardian."}

To avoid the private forces hired by the financial magnates, messengers in the Capital of Passion usually travel in the skies above the city, where security forces are scarce. They like to turn on pulse-scanning and look over the entire cyber city while chewing cheap gum and donning heavily modified holovisors. The holovisors project real-time information of the city directly onto the messenger's retina, turning impossible routes into an aerial path for the messengers: Building rooftops, air conditioning units, billboards, the arms of cranes... even unmanned logistics drones can become part of the path. Therefore, messengers must be skilled enough, as even one misstep would result in an unexpected and lethal fall. \"Some fool jammed all the holovisors indiscriminately while I was in the air!

Semicircular Electrode Collar Danger: \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Trading Value: 40-60 shield [Appearance] It is an irregular semi-circle, with two metal synapses on the inner side of the apex of the curve. There are also several buttons along the curve, but some buttons do not respond to input. Their functions are unknown. [Description] This object was discovered by our regular customer, Conrad. It was found in a place with some other small ancient relics, which I presume were mostly Old World households or personal objects. In terms of value, they won't make you rich overnight, but they're quite valuable. Conrad pointed out that its shape was strange, even the great Miner's Lamp had trouble identifying it. The Old World is full of strange objects, but this object doesn't even come close to being the strangest. With a little thought, I can try analyzing it. As usual, we'll start by analyzing its structure. With how neat the arc is, I'm inclined to believe that it was designed that way, rather than being forced into this shape by \"an external force.\" The bulk of the weight is concentrated at the center, so the sides appear to supportive. The arc interior is a concave surface... Don't think my words are too profound. When I appraise ancient relics, I must use professional and precise words. If it was like your intra-family chit-chat, then I might as well take down the \"Miner's Lamp\" sign, close my business, and make you pay for my storytelling. I'm only kidding. Let's continue the appraisal. The most striking thing about the exterior is the two curved pieces of metal. I've seen this before. This is similar to something that I had appraised before. When the switch was flipped, two metal pieces made a crackling sound. I quickly shut it down for fear of what would happen. It smelled like something was burning, You wonder what it was? The man who brought the object to me put his hands directly on it. I'll just say, bless Ol' Man Copper that my hands aren't fast. You see, the key to identifying ancient relics is better safe than sorry. This philosophy has gotten me out of trouble many times. So, I assume the metal parts are an electrode, which is the same as that thing. Wasn't it easy to deduce the function of this strangely shaped object? The key to identifying ancient relics is knowledge. That will come naturally with experience. Didn't you mention the key is supposed to be \"better safe than sorry\"? There are so many crucial factors to consider that it is hard to know them all. Why else would I be doing this line of business, and not you? I went through manuscripts and magazines from the Old World. I found some similarly shaped handicrafts made from cloth. The magazines say that They were worn from the back of the neck. No wonder it was shaped like an arc! However, I was afraid of what would happen, so I called over Conrad and put the thing around his neck. And what do you know? It was a perfect fit. If someone from the Old World saw it, he would have said it's worn around the neck as well. Conrad was overjoyed at how well it fit. He said the two pieces of metal fit comfortably on the nape of his neck and wondered what they were for. When I told him it was a torture device, he was so frightened that he took it off immediately. He lifted my chair and beat me hard. I was wronged! First of all, it wasn't powered. Secondly, I didn't even press the switch. Honestly! Since I have not seen another ancient relic like it so far, its rarity is temporarily set at four stars. Although it is a torture device, its effect is mild compared to the relics that can heat up and explode. Therefore, its danger level has been temporarily set at two stars. Old World Building Blocks. Old World Building Blocks Danger: Unknown Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Trading Value: 2g [Appearance] Several metal blocks of varying shapes with tongue and groove joints, which can be used to connect the blocks. These appear to be ancient relics, even by Old World standards. [Description] This object is really worthless, based solely on the price. Those who use the manual for the Miner's Lamp to identify ancient relics are looking to make a quick buck. But again, this isn't worth much. Some ancient relics are indeed extremely valuable: some because of extraordinary technology, while others because they are composed of rare materials. Although these metal building blocks could be considered ancient relics in the Old World, they are useless junk with an interesting shape in this day and age. Mr. Gaim brought the metal blocks to me. I told him at that time it wouldn't sell for anything. It didn't glow or heat up, had no buttons or wires, nor did he have enough of it. It was worthless junk metal with strange patterns. He didn't believe me, so he took it to someone else. And what happened? They laughed at him for wasting their time. Do you get it now? If you do want to sell, don't sell it as an ancient relic. Later on, he sold it to me at a very cheap price and I inquired about where he found them. It took me half a month to dig out the rest of the metal blocks. What a pain... At this point, probably someone will say I was tricking them. Why would I go through the trouble of digging it up if it's worthless? \"None of your darn business!\" That's what I was going to say. But just to explain, you can't survive in my line of business without a little OCD. You tell me, \"here are some blocks, but there's a few missing.\" Could you bear it? Absolutely not! I had to dig it out. Since then, I would find the time to piece together a few pieces in between appraisals. These strange metals block had to be one of a kind! I had never seen anything quite like it, at least in my line of work. In the beginning, I had no clue how to piece them together. Gradually, a shape began to take form, but it was taking up too much of my time. You can call me stupid, but it felt like some mysterious force was holding me back. Eight years had passed and I still hadn't completed it. But that mysterious voodoo-like quality made it all the more interesting. I read many more manuscripts from the Old World in those eight years. There was an article about \"cursed blocks.\" According to legends, there was a king in the Old World who suffered a coup. The king's most loyal wizard sealed the king's soul into blocks and split them to protect the king from being killed. However, the vengeful king will possess the person who pieced the blocks back together in attempt to reclaim his throne. Based on the description, I think it should be the same thing. Why are the people from the Old World so unreasonable? Don't invent these magic objects in the first place. Just invent powerful weapons so the king can suppress the coup. Then, I'd be able to make some money by selling those weapons, right? For safety concerns, I stopped trying to piece the metal blocks back together. It's not that I can't, but I don't like the thought of being possessed by an evil spirit from the Old World. Why would I want to? There's nothing left to reclaim. It's all just useless junk. Restoring the country? There's just no point. I might as well just give up. But here's the twist. \u2014 Someone finished the puzzle when I wasn't looking! He didn't even say anything. I don't even know if he was possessed by an evil spirit! And worst of all, he just left the metal blocks there after completing it. I respect him for not stealing, but why would you just leave it there? What if a ghost pops out afterwards? So, I sold it immediately. Last I heard, that neat little pyramid was being used to press the lid of a kimchi jar. The marked price is still the same as when I sold it to the old lady. Appraiser: Balaway the Miner's Lamp "}

At around August this year, the miner Steve and his colleagues discovered the rock crab nest in the Great Mine during their shift. Following which, all the workers in the Great Mine had a sumptuous meal. After that, the miners discovered more rock crab nests one after another while mining. This paper previously revealed that the Great Mine Administrative Committee a decided to provide salt-baked rock crabs for the workers' dinners for three consecutive weeks. A worker who wished to remain anonymous said: \"At least change it up a little! Why must it be the same thing every day?\" Concerning this, the Administrative Committee responded as follows: \"You are free to make your own food. If not, just sit quietly and eat your rock crabs in silence.\" In spite of the miners' intensifying protests against rock crabs, the sad irony is there would be no more such opportunity when they eventually come to miss the taste of rock crab in the future. The expansion of the rock crabs' nests could lead to the collapse of the mine. The supervisor and Administrative Committee of the Great Mine finally decided that, in order to ensure the safety of the mine, there needs to be continuous effort to completely eliminate hidden dangers. At present, all rock crab nests in Boulder Town's Great Mine have been destroyed.

The appropriate punishment and re-education will be implemented after he recovers. Rivet Town-Fragmentum Monster Encounters Intensifies Encounters between Rivet Town and the Fragmentum monsters intensify. According to information from Wildfire, there is a trend of the monsters that have invaded Rivet Town leaving the town. Thanks to the traffic blockade on the main road, a small number of these mindless monsters left the town and were dealt with by Wildfire. Years ago, Rivet Town was completely overrun by monsters from the Fragmentum, and is now in a state of abandonment. All miners please stay away from this place as much as possible. Don't let greed tempt you to return for property and possessions. Please ensure that personal safety is a top priority. Issue 192.

Steve immediately decided to fish for Rock Crabs with his fellow workers and delivered three large bags of Rock Crab caught to the Great Mine administrative office. The mine foreman informed all miners that they would be provided with free salt-baked Rock Crab for dinner for the next three days. This prompted the mining team to celebrate in elation.\"Finally, a feast,\" exclaimed a worker who preferred not to be named. The discussion on whether to destroy the Rock Crab nest is now at a fever pitch. Miner representatives who support destroying the nest expressed that if the Rock Crabs are allowed to roam free, they could pose a great safety hazard to the mine, while those who opposed refuted, saying it may be the only nest and it can provide a stable food source for the team. As of the time of publication, the Great Mine administration has yet to respond to this matter. The Great Mine Mine Bridge Lift Under Maintenance From August 19 The administration of the Great Mine area announced that the maintenance of the Great Mine's mine bridge lift will begin on August 19 and is expected to be completed on August 25.

Three cases of minor injury and one major injury were reported. All injured personnel have now been transferred to the Boulder Town clinic for diagnostic treatment. According to reliable sources, the accident was due to the aging of the hauling mine car track causing a hauling mine car to overturn while in operation. The Great Mine area supervisor immediately organized for all workers to be acquainted with relevant safety education, and requested that maintenance on the hauling mine car track be carried out at least once a month to ensure that similar accidents can be prevented.

It was described as a star devourer. It was destroyed by the Antimatter Legion around 5320 Star Calendar, an event which the Xianzhou Alliance observed without assisting either side. The surviving Wingweavers have since been reduced to mercenaries and intergalactic pirates, although the Xianzhou Yuque suspects that the Wingweavers' Peacock Legion may be trying to revive it. History. Muldrasil was the home of the winged subspecies of primate hominids known as wingweavers. It was a living artificial tree-like world with branches that allowed the wingweavers to warp to other worlds and plunder them for resources. It drew energy from the stars and has been described as a star devouring \"Dyson tree\". In Year 3400, Muldrasil approached the Xianzhou Luofu. In the event known as the \"Flaming Catastrophe War\", battle broke out between the Luofu and Muldrasil. Exhausted by Civil War (the \"Living Catastrophe\" of the Three Sufferings), the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, the Xianzhou residents were powerless to counter such a crisis. The tide of battle turned when the Reignbow shot an arrow into the Ambrosial Arbor, severing its connection with Muldrasil and ripping open a fissure into the void, releasing a monstrous wave of imaginary force. \"Investigation of Ancient Pattern Rubbings from the Luofu\" says that the arrow also destroyed Muldrasil. Muldrasil was destroyed by the Antimatter Legion around Year 5320 Star Calendar. The wingweavers became lost wanderers in space, reduced to mercenaries and intergalactic pirates. A Yuque intelligence report notes that based on IPC data, the wingweavers' Peacock Angel legion have arrived at the Consternation Starzone to locate a Stellaron and revive Muldrasil. The information has yet to be verified. According to the speculations of the Yuque's Divination Commission, there might be more than one world like Muldrasil."}

Chapter One A long time ago, the Eternal Freeze had just began in Belobog. The land was not yet fully covered by the heavy snow. All the animals were playing joyfully outside Belobog. Somewhere far away from Belobog lived a donkey who wanted to become a musician. One day, the master of the donkey went to him: \"Hmph hmph hmph, my old donkey, you hard-worked for me your whole life. What kind of dream do you have?\" The donkey was happy to learn that he might have a chance to fulfill his dream. \"Neigh neigh neigh, my kind master, I want to enter the theater of Belobog. I want to become a musician!\" His master nodded and said: \"A nice dream! How about this: I'll send you to the market of Belobog myself!\" The old donkey answered quickly: \"Neigh neigh neigh, the market of Belobog? Does that place need a musician, too?\" His master laughed: \"Hah hah hah, what place doesn't require a musician? Come to the backyard tomorrow morning. Don't be late!\" The old donkey recalled that many of his animal friends taken to the backyard had never returned. Only then did he realize that he was in big trouble! So the donkey packed up supplies and belongings and ran into the dark snowy night... Volume Two. Chapter Two More snow fell on its face, and the load it was carrying felt ever heavier. The old donkey felt the cold was hurting even his hooves: \"Neigh neigh neigh, when is this snowstorm going to end?\" A smart old hound heard the donkey's complaint and yawned as it was lying down behind some tree roots: \"Woof woof woof, snowstorm won't end! Why run in a rush! Careful you'll fall !\" The snow made it hard for the donkey to see and it had no strength to keep walking, so it hid behind the tree roots with the hound to shelter from the snow. But why would a hound appear in this snow-filled wilderness? The old donkey was intrigued. \"Neigh neigh, thank you ol' fella! But why are you lying in snow?\" Hearing this, the old hound only shook its head. \"Woof woof, you're welcome. Snow won't stop, prey are naught. Master was not nice, I was to pay the price! No way I could agree, so I had to flee!\" The old donkey sighed when he heard this. There was nowhere to go in the snowstorm. How could they stay alive? But he immediately thought of a good idea: \"Neigh neigh neigh, listen to me! There's a city called Belobog, and the weather there is very mild! I can play a tune, you can beat a drum, and we'll make the stage our home!\" The old hound thought it was a great idea. He lolled his tongue in delight, and even the hot vapor of his breath froze into ice flakes. \"Woof woof woof, then I'll come with you!\" Volume Three. Chapter Three The two animals walked together in the snow. Suddenly, the hound saw something fluffy by the side of the road. The old hound shook his head, thinking it was a trick of his eyes. \"Woof woof woof, my friend! Look over there, is that a ball of fur?\" That fluff ball actually reacted to the old hound's words and popped out a pair of ears. \"Meow meow meow, I am no fur ball!\" The old donkey and hound fixed their eyes, and saw the fluff ball was a sad-looking old black cat. \"I was once a prized rat-catcher, but in old age I became a no-good-walker. Wanted to toss me yonder, did my old Master. Meow meow meow, snow's cold all over. Where to find food ever?\" The old donkey shook his head. The old black cat was going to lose its life if no one looked after it! He suddenly remembered that cats like to sing at night, so he said to the cat: \"Neigh neigh neigh, old whiskers, worry no more! We head to Belobog, where the weather is mild! You love to sing at night, so we can go the Golden Theater and sing alright!\" The old black cat thought for a while, and decided this was not a bad idea. So, the old cat flicked its ears, and joined the old donkey and hound's journey. Volume Four. Chapter Four With friends on the journey, the trip was more lively! The three animals all complained about their masters, and their steps were ever faster. Then, they heard a voice agreeing with them in the snow. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo, what you say is so true!\" The black old cat led its friends towards the voice, and found a rooster screeching on top of a broken fence. Before the three friends could speak, the rooster was quick to squeak. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo, snow all fell down, squashed my village gone! Y'all carrying backpacks. Looking for tourist tracks?\" The old cat shook its head and answered. \"Meow meow meow, we're in no mood to wander! Belobog right ahead can be found, and its weather's warm all year round! You like to train your voice all day, why not go with us to make a name and stay?\" The rooster nodded hurriedly and perched on top of the old donkey's back, urging everyone to depart. But soon this loud rooster said something else. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo, by the way, do you all have to rhyme when you talk normally?\" \"Woof woof woof, you don't talk in rhyme normally, either?\" The old hound tilted its head at the rooster. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo, I heard you talk like that, so I just copied you all.\" The other three friends fell silent, with not even a whisper for a long while. Volume Five. Chapter Five The four musical genii finally joined forces. They promised to each other that they will definitely become real musicians when they get to Belobog! However, as they wandered, they accidentally entered the Belobog Underworld. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo! Belobog is so warm! Even a bit too hot.\" The old donkey agreed. \"Neigh neigh neigh, not only am toasting, I could also use some eating.\" As the old donkey said this, the four old mates could smell the fragrant scent in the air. The old hound was the most sensitive to smell. It immediately flared its nostrils and led everyone towards the source of the scent. They soon stopped before a majestic building. The old hound put its forelimbs on the door and its tail twirled around like a cartwheel. \"Woof woof woof! The smell is coming from inside here!\" \"Meow meow meow, what goodies does this place have? Old donkey, you're the tallest, help us see!\" The old donkey was about to lift its hoof onto the windowsill to have a better look, but the door of the building opened on its own! \"Welcome to the local grand hotel! Please come inside, guests!\" A friendly old grandpa answered the door and warmly invited the animal friends to the table. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo! This is pretty good, and we are hungry! How about it, wanna go eat something?\" The old donkey was very happy, and replied while lifting its hooves in the air. \"Neigh neigh neigh, that can do! You lot brought money?\" \"Woof woof woof, no!\" \"Meow meow meow, no!\" \"Cock-a-doodle-doo, no!\" The four friends stared at each other. Volume Six. \"*The sixth chapter was written in a thin and elegant hand, as if it was bound at a later date.*\" Chapter Six The owner of the hotel saw how the four musicians were in a tight spot. He scratched his chin and soon came up with a good idea: \"It's okay if you don't have money. If you can put up a good performance, then you can have a feast!\" The four friends soon realized something: Wasn't this the perfect opportunity to make a name? Then, the four friends quickly agreed to the offer. The guests in the hotel all stopped eating and looked at the four animals in the middle of the room, looking forward to the performance. Finally, the four stepped onto the stage. However, there were no instruments here and no drums. How could they have a performance? After a long time, the smartest member had an idea. The old black cat cleared its throat. \"Meow meow meow, hey check it out! The blizzard is nigh and we're trapped, no doubt!\" \"Our stomachs are grumbling, so food's what we're about! And this rap performance will be our payout!\" The other three animals immediately understood what the old cat wanted to do. The old donkey knocked on the floor with its hooves, and the old hound and rooster imitated the sounds of drums and cymbals with their throats and made an accompanying beat. Everyone in the room was shocked. They had never heard this type of music before, but were deeply attracted to this lively beat. The hotel owner was also moved and offered a hearty meal to the talented musicians, as he had promised. After that, the names of the four old mates spread throughout Belobog. They were even invited by the Supreme Guardian to perform \"rap\" at the Golden Theater. Then, the four musicians finally achieved their dream at Belobog and lived happily ever after. This art form called \"rap\" continued till today, becoming popular amongst the families living in the Underworld. True Ending. \"*It seems someone forcibly tore off this sheet of paper from a book.*\" Chapter Six The four poor animals all had rumbling stomachs and had no energy left to think. \"We can give you a good performance. Would that be enough for a simple meal?\" The hotel owner thought briefly and smiled kindly at the four animals. \"I didn't take you to be artists! How can I possibly take your money?\" The four musicians became delighted at this: What a nice owner! Then, the owner led the four friends into a private room. \"What would you like to eat? Why not come with me to the kitchen to have a look?\" Everyone was too hungry to move, and only the old rooster was still lively. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo, how wonderful! Everyone sit tight, I'll pick out our dinner!\" The rooster happily headed to the kitchen with the owner, and the rest of the friends waited patiently in the room. Soon, the old hound smelled the scent of food with its sharp nose. \"Woof woof woof, quick, sniff! This smells delicious!\" The old donkey had a big nose, and it smelled lots of the scent. \"Neigh neigh neigh, indeed! What food could be so tasty?\" The wise old cat tried recalling food it had eaten before. \"Meow meow meow, this is good! It's the scent of animal fat! We're in for a good treat!\" The owner then returned with a pot of fragrant soup. \"Friends! Enjoy this fowl and ginseng soup!\" And that was how the story of the four musicians in Belobog ended. \"*There was a comment at the bottom of the page in elegant handwriting: \"What kind of ending is this? ...I'm gonna write an ending for this story myself.\"*\""}

Description. Young Oakley practiced and practiced. She trained in the ranch from dawn to dusk. At times, her father felt surreptitiously surprised by and proud of little Oakley's talents, while other times he fretted over her future living the life of a musketeer. Oakley's mother seemed to be the only one who actually cared and felt for young Oakley's tender little hands, often blaming Oakley's father for teaching her how to fire a gun. From the fateful duel to the completion of her first bounty and her later fame, Oakley had used the same pair of worn gloves for years. Her peers didn't understand her insistence on wearing the same pair of broken gloves \u2014 Only she knew the conflicting emotions within those gloves, for they were the parting gifts her mother gave her. What sort of emotional struggles must Oakley's mother have gone through, when she had been so stubbornly opposed to Oakley learning her way around guns? After that duel, her mother wept unceasingly in Oakley's arms. Oakley didn't say anything, but her mother had already read Oakley's thoughts."}

She was always wearing her riding boots to march to the farthest reaches of the world, regardless of how meager a pay she would get. She had a hunch \u2014 that mysterious gunslinger must also be a man of seclusion. Their encounter would inevitably occur at a place frequented by few. After coming by a harmonica, Oakley spent most of her alone time on intermittent practicing of songs. Her audience? No one but tarantulas, sandstorms, and tumbleweeds. Through her journey, Oakley was becoming better at coming up with techniques to kill time. It was said that wind had once stood and listened to Oakley's play on the harmonica, only leaving when the whole song came to an end. The IPC offered bounty hunters plenty of opportunities for interstellar traveling, and the destination was never a concern for this particular lone musketeer. Sometimes Oakley did wonder if she was just chasing a phantom all this time, since that mysterious gunslinger was long gone without a trace. Sometimes it seemed that all Oakley ever did was to set out for one mission after another. Oakley insisted, however, that as long as her fame as the Wild Wheat was far-reaching enough, the mysterious gunslinger would eventually show up at her door, just like how he once did at the ranch to duel her father."}

Bounty hunters, whether intentionally or not, always sought to craft emblems of their own, in the hope that these items could one day become the beginning of great legends. The Interastral Peace Corporation offered bounties to enlist experts of the highest caliber to hunt down Interastral Pirates and Oakley, as one who always worked alone, forever sought out the most challenging regions of desolation among the farthest reaches of the world. Days under the scorching hot sun were coupled with bitterly cold nights. In her lonely odyssey, Oakley could fall asleep with her head pillowed on her felt hat whenever she was near a bonfire. All her dreams were intruded by a mysterious gunslinger, who claimed to be a bounty hunter from afar. His scrawny figure was in sharp contrast with his fiercely stern gaze. The gunslinger challenged Oakley's father to a duel to the death at high noon. Shots were fired, a felt-hat was dropped, and Oakley's father was falling backwards to the ground, followed by the sounds of weeping and wailing from Oakley's mother... Little Oakley gawked at the gunslinger in stupor, whose aptitude with a gun was so superb that her father could never stand a chance. Waking up, there would be traces of damp tears on Oakley's felt hat. As a child, she learned how to shoot a gun only because she had wanted her father's handsome and stylish hat."}

Story. Oakley was raised on a ranch with her mother and father and spent her time growing up learning how to shoot. Her father was both proud of her talents and afraid of her future as a musketeer, while her mother cared for her and blamed him for teaching her. Oakley however, was only interested in learning so she could earn her father's felt hat. He taught her not only how to shoot, but how to cover her preparatory movements under her cloak before the duel even started. One day, while Oakley was young, a bounty hunter from afar came to her home and challenged her father to a duel to the death at high noon. The bounty hunter's skill left Oakley in a stupor, and left a strong impression on her after her father was killed that quickly turned into an lifelong obsession to get revenge. Using the skills she developed as a child, Oakley set out to become a bounty hunter in an attempt to find him. Her mother, while previously against her daughter learning to shoot, gave her a pair of gloves as a parting gift as she had already accepted Oakley's choice. Tucking wheat into her father's hat, she then began to take jobs in remote and far off locations in hopes of running into the solitary hunter. Oakley quickly became known as the Wild Wheat, and gained a reputation among her fellow bounty hunters as someone who was thoughtless, expressionless, and leaving her opponents with no hope: a reputation that upset her as she realized she was becoming more and more like her nemesis. Even so, she hoped that this reputation will eventually cause him to seek her out like he did with her father. Once, while riding the Astral Express near the border planet of Frati, the former Navigator and passengers all vanished mysteriously due to an anomaly. At the request of the conductor, Oakley temporarily assumed the position of Navigator. While Navigator, Oakley defended the Express from several savage star beasts, brought the Express back to safety, and assisted in finding missing passengers and gathering new passengers. After gathering a sufficient number of new passengers, Oakley quietly left the Express. She remains the Astral Express Navigator with the shortest tenure, at six months and two days. She has notable skill with a harmonica, enough for others to tell legends that the wind has once stood and listened to her play."}

Well, if that \"mature and composed\" Pepeshi were here to hear such a compliment, he would likely don a serious expression and stroke his mustache. But seriously, the stark contrast between his childlike and adult qualities adds to his overall charm. He is honest, open-minded, and optimistic, while also displaying intelligence and diligence in his work. He is calm and reliable while working, making him quite charming. However, that doesn't imply that we should take our relationship any further. While I hold admiration for him, that is the full extent of my emotions. Therefore, when he jokingly asked if I would like to share his property, I realized that our friendship might be reaching its conclusion, because I understood precisely what that means to a Pepeshi. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the situation, although it may sound hypocritical. The truth was, we were not compatible. While he is a remarkable entrepreneur and already made a name for himself within the Alfalfa Family at a young age, the outstanding qualities that contributed to his success didn't quite... align with our relationship. From my perspective, even the closest of companions require a certain level of distance and privacy. The idea of being constantly together with someone else is difficult for me to imagine. However, when a Pepeshi develops feelings for you, their attention becomes solely focused on you. This can feel... burdensome. Danny will undoubtedly find someone deserving of his wholehearted devotion, but that person should not be me. June 10th Today is perhaps a memorable day as I had a pleasant conversation with a Halovian. This race is indeed the beloved of all creations, and it comes as no surprise that they are often described as divine beings or angels. Given their elegant and mysterious smiles, enchanting and captivating voices, and stunning and lovely appearance... they are destined to attract attention. Mr. Leslie turned out to be more approachable than I had initially expected. We watched a movie together and enjoyed a dinner. Our conversation flowed effortlessly, and he shared stories about how envoys of The Family descended during Penacony's crisis and turned the issue to the planet's favor, as well as the Halovians' efforts in constructing this city of sweetest dreams for the Aeon of Harmony they worship. His stories were captivating, and the atmosphere between us was light-hearted. He even kindly escorted me back to the hotel. I appreciated his friendliness and kindness, and I found his beauty captivating. However, there was an undeniable sense of... detachment on him that I couldn't overcome. Perhaps I'm being overly sensitive, but upon reflection, continuing this encounter might not be worthwhile. After all, it is said that voice of a Halovian's heart is shared only among their own kind. June 30th Mr. Screwbrugh is a refined and sophisticated gentleman, or perhaps the term \"maestro\" would be fitting. I must admit that, prior to my arrival in Penacony, I held certain prejudices against Intellitrons due to certain rumors... After all, the actions of Emperor Rubert are well-known throughout the cosmos. However, the Intellitrons here... they are elegantly dressed and display courteous behavior. During my conversation with Mr. Screwbrugh, I could sense his genuine curiosity and respect for organic life. His intellect shone through his wise and humorous remarks. Occasionally, his questions took an unconventional or cunning approach, yet they never caused any offense. Through our discussions, I gained insights into various intriguing aspects of the \"Inorganic Life Zone,\" such as their customs, culture, beliefs, and values. Engaging in rational exchanges like this allowed me to catch glimpses of their souls amidst the sparks of knowledge. I find this unique race to be absolutely fascinating. Their rationality and purity possess an irresistible allure to me. I'm willing to invest more effort into understanding their kind. Perhaps among them, I may discover a kindred spirit, or even a soul mate. July 1st Hereby, I'm declaring: I have fallen in love! The instant I caught sight of the girl in the crowd, I knew she was the one! Rational thinking became meaningless when she smiled at me, and logic lost its value when she spoke to me.

Unfortunately, despite my efforts to establish a connection with her, she showed no further interest in me, but that doesn't matter. She will eventually see me, and someday, her gaze will forever be fixed upon me."}

THEY are the overall main antagonist of the game. Profile. Witnessing the destruction in Adlivun as the world was marred by The Swarm and the Mechanical Empire during their birth, Nanook sees the creation of the universe as a mistake and seeks to destroy everything. After ascending to Aeonhood, Nanook allegedly ignited THEIR home world. Despite being the most recently ascended Aeon, Nanook and THEIR minions may already be considered the greatest menace in all the galaxy. Appearance. Nanook often appears as a human male that has long white hair with long braids and brown skin and golden eyes. A giant scar, along with multiple scars, is seen on THEIR chest as golden liquid seeps out. A quarter of THEIR arms are floating, and half of THEIR lower body is golden flames and black smoke, indicating THEIR path of destruction. Story. History. Swarm Disaster. Nanook is the youngest Aeon and did not exist at the time of the . Adlivun. Nanook came from a star system called Adlivun. Adlivun was a world marred by the Emperor's War and was also in the path of the Swarm. Akivili visited Adlivun when it was still fighting a war with the descendants of the Imperator Insectorum. Adlivun was destroyed and Nanook probably ignited it THEMSELF. Lord Ravagers. Lord Ravagers are Emanators of Destruction recruited by Nanook from the worlds they have destroyed. They are remade by Nanook in the world of the Warforge and each represent a different aspect of Destruction. There are seven Lord Ravagers, five of whom have known names: Phantylia, Zephyro, Celenova, Irontomb, Sun Devourer. There also used to be a Lord Ravager called Zulo who was replaced by Celenova. Fetora. Nanook destroyed a White Star named Fetora. The flames of the White Star coalesced with the power of Destruction to give birth to plasmic lifeforms. The fire demon Ifrit also known as Duke Inferno was born and has been obsessed with destruction and slaughter since birth. The embers left behind from the star's destruction were clasped in Ifrit's own hands, molded into the shape of Fetora's crown, and worn to this day. Ifrit would later go on to lead the Ever-Flame Mansion, a subgroup of the Annihilation Gang. Present. Herta Space Station. During the Antimatter Legion's attack on the Herta Space Station, when the Trailblazer protects March 7th from the attack of Doomsday Beast, Nanook gazes at the Trailblazer. Simulated Universe. When Nanook appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: Dev Log1. Related Entry \u2014 The Destruction ...Frankly, I still don't understand why Nanook the Destruction was born. Terminus the Finality was already traversing the universe before Nanook appeared. Is Destruction not included in Finality? We know so little about the secrets of the Paths. From the example of Xipe and Ena, we know that Paths with similar concepts can collide with each other, such as Order being included in Harmony resulting in Xipe absorbing Ena when the former ascended. It feels rather like survival of the fittest. However, there are examples of similar Paths co-existing for different lengths of time, such as Preservation with Remembrance and Abundance with Propagation. I guess perhaps our mortal conclusions about the Paths are still not at a high enough level. The true meaning of a Path cannot be completely expressed with just one word, or perhaps there are even deeper secrets regarding the Paths and the Aeons... Dev Log2. Related Entry \u2014 The Destruction ...Nanook came from a star system called Adlivun, which has now been \"destroyed.\" The birth of an Aeon was often accompanied by an anomaly that shook the universe, and Nanook had probably ignited their own home. I got some information from the Astral Express on how Adlivun used to be. It was a tragic world completely marred by the Emperor's War, and was unfortunate enough to be on the path of the Swarm's march. When Akivili arrived there, Adlivun was still fighting a tense and endless war with the remaining descendants of the Imperator Insectorum. What kind of an Aeon would such a planet create? It is therefore not hard to imagine its eventual fate..."}

I understand how difficult it must be for your family as the end of the year approaches. However, some of you haven't seen your children for so long that I can't help but wonder about your motives. I have enclosed a list of the children who haven't seen their parents in over 100 days. I hope these parents will visit before the end of this month. If not, I will be adding your names to my notebook. Those who are in my notebook had better pray you don't get sick or hurt, or I'll be sure to take care of you using my family's secret recipe and a large dose of \"compassion.\" Isabella: \"11 years old, 133 days without visits\" Little Bella is the most well-tempered and sensible child at the clinic. She often volunteers to help with the chores and takes care of the other children while I'm away. If you're Bella's parents, I suggest you learn about childcare from her, because I'm pretty sure you wouldn't even be able to care for a mad mole that eats anything. Big Charlie: \"9 years old, 164 days without visits\" Big Charlie is a child with quite a temper, probably something he learned from his parents. He doesn't know his own strength and frequently gets into fights with the other children, for which I've scolded him on numerous occasions. However, he has shown an interest in medicine and is capable of making basic potions that he uses on his own bruises. If you're Charlie's parents, please visit him soon, or I'll teach him how to make \"special\" potions for you. Little Charlie: \"7 years old, 115 days without visits\" It's been almost a year since Little Charlie joined us, yet he hasn't said a single word. Little Charlie's parents, count yourselves lucky. I know what you look like because he always keeps a family photo in his pocket. Believe me when I say that I'll personally come to find you if you don't visit. I can only assume you're suffering from amnesia, and I have the right remedy for it. Timmy: \"8 years old, 153 days without visits\" Little Timmy, oh little Timmy, what a headache. I don't know where he read about the existence of \"pigeons.\" Ever since then, he's been obsessed with studying \"birds.\" I told him that there are no birds in the Underground, but he won't listen and still constantly daydreams about them.

New Londinium is the Interastral Peace Corporation's industrial planet. A place that produces heavy pollution constantly. The air was described to have used to smell of suffocating smoke, stinking like Baviru cheese that had been sitting in the cupboard for six months. It was impossible to get around without an air purifier mask made by the IPC in the filthy environment. Advertisements, news and announcements are projected in the sky. There is a saying, \"Even the poorest worker in east New Londinium can't help but feel proud of the wealth we jointly own with the IPC!\" History. A Baviru IPC employee who was recently promoted to P30 from the Traditional Project Department in New Londinium once accidentally crashed their flying motorcycle after looking up briefly at the news projected in the sky to find out the latest happenings in the bustling city and saw face of the co-prime minister. When Colleen was there the first time, she was inexperienced and couldn't breathe when she got off the ship. Luckily, a passerby managed to bring her to a physician in time. All the physicians on that planet wore face-covering beak masks. Initially, she thought they had deliberately dressed themselves to look stylish and were silently mocking them. It was until they put the same mask on her that she realized she could breathe freely again. Just then, Colleen saw a projection of the company's advertisement appearing in the sky. In it was a man dressed in a suit, and he spoke in a tone that fit his appearance, \"Citizens of New Londinium, all of you have been performing well for the past year. IPC's efficiency has also improved tremendously, a big step forward for environmental protection.\" Those words were so ridiculous to her that Colleen burst out laughing, and the people around looked at her dubiously. She hurried and explained to them that this was the oldest joke in the history of mankind \u2014 no matter where you're heading, you're walking forward. Later, when she left New Londinium, Colleen realized the beak-looking air purifying mask was a limited edition and wasn't sold on other planets. No matter how hard she tried, she could only get cheap alternatives. Boothill was accused of burning down a warehouse in New Londinium. All the newly purchased pollution control equipment were gone and the Chemical Products Factory had to redo their accounting, though they managed to snake through that year's environmental inspection."}

Description. The Nightingale Family is an assembly of the keenest and brightest minds, and is in charge of managing technology among the five lineages. The dream architects that the Nightingale Family employs are commonly called Dreamers or Dreamweavers. They gather along the borders of various Dreamscapes, always pushing the horizon of this world of fantasy. Aside from Dreamers dedicated to the construction of Dreamscapes, many members also research dream-based phenomena. The Pepeshi people and Intellitrons are often members of the Nightingale Family. The Nightingale Family uses Dream Eye's and Dream Modules to repair the Dreamscape. The Nightingale Family is the basis for the Origami Birds in the Clockie animated series. History. In 2151 Amber Era, the Dreamweaving Project had officially launched. The Twelve Dreamscapes were slated to be completed within this Amber Era. The Nightingale Family was fully responsible for this project. According to negotiations, the Nightingale Family Head Glaux had expressed no intention to join The Family of Harmony, but was willing to support the Dreamscape development plan that The Family had suggested. The Nightingale Family had extended an invitation to the universe to welcome the architects and memoria scholars of the cosmos to build this world of Dreamjoy together. As the Reverie Hotel had opened, the first Charmony Festival was successfully held. Construction of the Twelves Hours of the Dreamscapes was almost near its end. The Oak Family Head Gopher Wood declared the \"unity of the five major lineages.\" Due to the Nightingale Family's refusal, their members were brutally treated by the Hounds from the Bloodhound Family. Under pressure, Glaux resigned his post as the Nightingale Family Head, and founded the Paperfold Academy. Fischer succeeded the Nightingale Family Head, and eventually the Nightingale Family joined The Family. Currently, Sir Whittaker is the Nightingale Family Head. Dream's Edge is the latest project under construction."}

Serval is a tall, blue-eyed woman with blond hair that has dark blue streaks and light blue tips at the ends. She has a single hoop earing, a black choker, black nail polish, and a purple lightning bolt tattoo on her waist. She wears what appears to be a black tube top stitched together with half of a white labcoat. The labcoat trails down to her ankle, and has a burn hole near the bottom. She wears detached sleeves that match the color of each side of her top, with two belts wrapped around her black sleeve and a blue feather pin on her white sleeve. She has mismatched fingerless gloves, with a black leather glove on her right hand and a pink cloth glove on her left. She also wears a royal blue miniskirt with a cutout over a pair of navy blue shorts, fastened with a black leather belt. She wears a set of pantyhose, with a black thigh-high stocking on her right leg, and black ankle boots with gold lining. Background. Serval is a mechanic, born and raised in Belobog as a member of the prestigious Landau family. She is the eldest of the three Landau siblings, the other two being Gepard, a captain of the Silvermane Guards, and Lynx. When she was younger, Serval studied at Belobog Academy with a major in mechanics, where she also met her then best friend, Cocolia. After graduating, Serval began her work as an Architect under the Stellaron Research Division, where she made many contributions. This eventually caught the attention of the then current Supreme Guardian, Cocolia, who ultimately decided to destroy her research and expel her from the Architects permanently in order to prevent Serval from knowing the truth about the Stellaron. After her expulsion, Serval became an independent mechanic and opened a shop at the bottom of Qlipoth Fort. She was eventually visited by members of the Astral Express crew \u2014 the Trailblazer, March 7th, and Dan Heng \u2014 at Gepard's suggestion. Not long after, Serval was then requested by the crew and Seele for her aid in the search for the Stellaron that caused the Everwinter that plagued Jarilo-VI. Reinvigorated by a desire to see the Stellaron and uncover the truth that Cocolia didn't want her to find, Serval enthusiastically helped the crew sneak into the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone, where they battled Silvermane Captain Dunn. At the final gate that separated them from the Stellaron, they were blocked by Gepard, who was ordered by Cocolia to not let anyone inside the Corridor of Fading Echoes\u2014which, unbeknownst to them, was where Cocolia took Bronya before moving to the Stellaron's true location in Everwinter Hill. The crew successfully defeated Gepard, who then came to terms with his sister's conviction, allowing them to pass through. Despite wanting to uncover the truth, Serval decided to stay behind and help her brother fight the appearing Fragmentum monsters. After the defeat of the Stellaron-empowered Cocolia, Serval, along with the help of Bronya and Seele, congratulated the crew on their hard-fought victory and celebrated the rise of their new Supreme Guardian with the people of Belobog."}

Description. It is believed by scholars that places where the space-time curvature are most extreme are shadows of IX. When a Shadow of IX appears it's most prominent trait is the creation of Self-Annihilators, beings who have entered the Shadow of IX and from that moment have lost the meaning of their existence. Shadows of IX can appear in numerous forms, such as the \"Black Great Sun\" which threatened to destroy Izumo and Takamagahara before Acheron destroyed both planets. Another Shadow of IX appeared in a Memory Bubble sealed away by a faceless woman in a Memory Zone. This was later broken open by a Self-Annihilator and eventually destroyed by a group of Arbitrators. The Self-Annihilators' connections to Shadows of IX goes deeper than just a form of transformation. As theorized by Dr. Primitive, as Self-Annihilators aimlessly traverse the cosmos, they are also casting the shadow of the Aeon around the universe. As for the few who can single-handedly withstand the encroachment of Nihility on their existences, their journey of self-annihilation is drawn out to infinity, and the road they walk is like a shadow of IX cast in the world. When the Doctors of Chaos created the Tonic of Efficacious Chaos, one of its side effects was causing Self-Annihilators to behold a Shadow of IX."}

Text. \"*A large chunk of information has been corrupted*\" [Week \u2588\u2588] The results of the review are out, and funding has been halved \u2014 with a \"friendly\" suggestion to modify the research direction. They've started reducing the number of Xianzhou exchanges and while I'm too lazy to argue with them, I have to admit that they do have a point. Indeed, there really is little commercial use for the study of folk histories alone, and nobody can squeeze any value out of the Xianzhou people... After all these years of academic research, I've finally begun to feel my enthusiasm and determination waning... No, they're completely exhausted, and that's worse than running out of funding. But now the question is: What am I going to do? Money's running thin, and manpower is tight... That guy Todd's just started a family, and I can't fork out for any overtime. What a junk topic this is, cracking the secret of immortality... Ha, I said it'd take ten years to solve, but now it really is a joke... \"*A large chunk of information has been corrupted*\" [Week \u2588\u2588] I kinda miss the ramen stand outside the library on Planet \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Walking out from all that study to a warm bowl of spicy noodles in the darkness of night \u2014 what an experience. \"Extra garlic, extra chili, extra meat, please!\" With a couple of glugs of oil, it's the ultimate taste! Think about the trash we ate aboard the Xianzhou: Mung bean soda!? Even a toilet would refuse to take that down. Also, I just calculated the remaining funds. It'd only be enough for extra garlic. \"*Several entry dates remain unfilled*\" [Week \u2588\u2588] I nearly starved to death wandering lost around the streets of Starskiff Haven. A Vidyadhara brother treated me to a hot meal. I have to say that they really do as a people have tremendous taste. After chatting for a while, I feel like I've had a revelation that I haven't quite yet figured out... Should I persist? Or should I leave the Xianzhou with everyone else?No matter what, I know that I have to stay positive and optimistic about things. I have to believe in myself. I have to believe that I can find the secret of eternal youth.I'm tired, so very tired. What a waste of space I am. [Week \u2588\u2588] I had dinner with my buddy \u2588\u2588\u2588 (he paid), and we chatted about various folk myths around the galaxy. I learned that some tribes' myths of \"fountain of youth\" and \"secret underwater kingdoms\" share similarities with the Vidyadhara legends that \u2588\u2588\u2588 told me. But any connection between them remains to be seen. Especially the \"past events\" about the Vidyadhara which \u2588\u2588\u2588 said \u2014 well, they regard it as memories past, so it should be an oral history passed down through generations. I've never heard of such a thing, and the Guild has no such record either. A daring idea now tugs at my gray matter... Weekly work plan:1. Check over Vidyadhara materials \u221a2. Borrow some Xianzhou classics \u221a3. Review the literature \u221a4. Resubmit my thesis topic \u00d7 [Week \u2588\u2588] Weekly work plan:1. Record the Vidyadhara's oral history. \u221a2. Revise the thesis topic \u221a After all that from the Guild, my thesis into genetic longevity of the Xianzhou people has fizzled out. I knew it would. Next, they'll probably devote full resources to researching the secret of Foxian tails. But it won't amount to anything. Growing fluffy ears and a tail means there's a risk of uncontrollable growth, and their lifespan isn't very long \u2014 meaning their cellular vigor is severely limited. It's a shame that nobody believes me. Ah, forget about it \u2014 geniuses are destined to be lonely. Let's wait and see. [Week \u2588\u2588] ...\u2588\u2588\u2588 may look cold, but I never expected him to be so warm-hearted \u2014 otherwise, he wouldn't have saved me back then.He took me to the legendary Scalegorge Waterscape. I'd heard of such oral histories, but never expected so many physical ruins to remain. He also agrees with my views on recorded history: The past is more than just a random memory. It must be recorded in writing so that more people can witness the glory of days gone by. ...The retro-natal ecosystem of the Vidyadhara is really interesting. Just soaking in these pools leaves me feeling a whole lot younger... And as for this auto-incubation method of theirs... ...I got a tube of Vidyadhara egg extract and to be honest, I was worried that my needle wouldn't penetrate their \"eggshells.\" On the way back, I ran into a vehicle checkpoint at the Starskiff Haven which freaked me out \u2014 but luckily, I wasn't exposed. Sure enough, the Guild has launched their new genetic sequencing project. There's not much time left for me. [Week \u2588\u2588] I wrote a few times to hurry up that kid Todd. He said he was all ready to go, but I'm guessing that he'll be too late.I guess I'll have to do this myself, then. [Week \u2588\u2588] ...My skin has recovered its elasticity, and I have more hair in my follicles. The latter is actually a pleasure. I never thought that I'd be able to solve this thorny genetic problem along the way. If I can do it, then this alone would be incredible. I'm still not sure when the cellular vigor can reach normal Vidyadhara levels, but based on hair follicle regeneration results I believe that it already may have happened. [Week \u2588\u2588] Once enough growth has occurred, it stops \u2014 and the next growth stage doesn't perform as well.The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 concentration is also below average, which I take to be a sign of insufficient extraction.I've talked with \u2588\u2588\u2588 and planned on visiting the Scalegorge Waterscape with him sometime later. I assume he was quite pleased with my chronicle draft from last time. [Week \u2588\u2588] Ha, eureka!I did it!! This long Xianzhou trip of mine has finally reached its destination: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588!!!The boss at the Cloudstride Hotel came to visit this morning to get some customer satisfaction feedback. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, she didn't recognize me at all. She politely asked, \"When is Mr. Bernini coming back?\", and was curious about why I was in his room.\"I'm one of Bernini's students\" was how I answered, in a voice that sounded sharp but raspy. It reminded me of the trouble I had joining the school choir back when I was 14 and my voice was just breaking.After I got her to leave, I finally checked myself out in all my glory in the mirror.I was young, handsome, and sculpted like a statue.Hahahaha!!!Once I get genetically certified back at the Guild, I'll have access to unlimited wealth and power \u2014 and all the time in the world for research. [Week \u2588\u2588] I \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 feel like I've forgotten lots about \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588and I, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, have been so lazy and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 sleeping so long \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588I can't open my diary, as I've forgotten the password \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Some time after the destruction of Muldrasil in Year 5320 Star Calendar, Shuhu brought the dead planet of Rahu back to life, an act which was witnessed by, and awed, the former Xianzhou Yaoqing Helm-Master Yueyan. Yueyan became a follower of Shuhu's and established the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus as its first master. In the Disciples' lore, Yaoshi traveled on Rahu with Shuhu and gave Shuhu their instructions, which became the basis of the text \"Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation\". The Disciples use this text as part of their initiation rite for prospective members, who must record the text 500 times. The \"Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation\" is a forgery according to the official announcement from the Ten-Lords Commission.

About 700 years ago, the High-Cloud Quintet formed to save the Yuque from a Denizens of Abundance invasion. At some point in this era, Shuhu was presumably involved in an event known as The Shuhu Upheaval witnessed by Jing Yuan. According to Jingliu and presumably Phantylia, Shuhu rallied a great army to attack the Luofu and set up the Sanguinary Abyss to block the Xianzhou soldiers. Dan Feng fell into Dragon's Delirium when fighting Shuhu. Then, Baiheng charged ahead and shattered the enemy's defenses, allowing the Xianzhou soldiers to break through Shuhu's Sanguinary Abyss and awaken Dan Feng from his Dragon's Delirium. Shuhu was eventually defeated by Baiheng's self-destruct attack, but it is unclear if Shuhu was actually killed. Jingliu also says that Yingxing used the flesh of an Abundance Emanator to aid Dan Feng in resurrecting Baiheng, leading to Yingxing's transformation into an abomination now known as Blade. After attacking the Xianzhou Alliance, Shuhu disappeared and there are no records of his remains according to Jingliu. According to the \"Ten-Lords Commission Criminal Directory\", Shuhu may be imprisoned in the Shackling Prison now. However, it is uncertain if this is true as the box supposedly containing Shuhu has not been opened. It is kept in the lowest level of the prison."}

When discussing Oswaldo Schneider, the head of the IPC's Marketing Development Department, people often focus on the decisive operations he undertook upon assuming the position. Within just two years, this young fanatic conquered the bitter cold, pestilence, and death, and managed to address three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of harsh conditions and strife. Situated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild. In reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size. They share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"shellslasher,\" who have a reputation of being the most ferocious clan among Sigonians. And \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" who are often accused of pilfering by those willfully ignorant. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, engaged in a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive \u2014 until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion. Afterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the wider cosmos. Unfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians viewed the former's resourcefulness with suspicion, while slandering the latter as nothing more than predators with no hope of enlightenment. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these devious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert. As a token of apology, they even went out of their way to declare that \"the Avgins shall forever retain the right to autonomy\" \u2014 In other words, should any future conflicts occur between the two clans, they could justifiably and lawfully sit back and do nothing."}

The Avgins are blessed with attractive facial features, beautiful eyes, and an innate wealth of emotional intelligence, all of which effortlessly endear themselves to any strangers. However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. And the envious and snobbish soon begin their ceaseless slander, and the baseless defamation of the Avgins thus spreads like wildfire throughout the cosmos. As mere rumors can suffice to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a peripheral world, found themselves assailed without recourse, subject to all manners of suspicion and prejudice. The Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites, the only kind of gemstones capable of rivaling the resplendence of Gaiathra Triclops' divine body, which in their mythology is believed to have been reborn from death. Known as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace. The Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess \u2014 the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish. On that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth. According to the incident report by the Marketing Development Department, that shocking conflict took place on a night of Kakava. It was a stormy night when the clouds and fog engulfed the northern lights, which should have been seen as an ill omen. However, the Avgin people were unexpectedly excited. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response. \"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess.

Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace. The Avgins have a festival known as Kakava which celebrates the yearly rebirth of the Gaiathra Triclops. They believe that all that exists on the land is a part of Gaiathra's divine body, and that this body perishes each year and ascends as an aurora in the night sky. Then, Gaiathra is reborn the next day. During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth. History. The Avgins and Katicans had a long-standing enmity, and were engaged in a cycle of enmity for many Amber Eras. Sigonian Sovereignty. One day, the IPC initiated an operation on Sigonia led by Oswaldo Schneider. Under the IPC's guidance, Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter. However, due to the other clans' prejudice against the Avgins and the Katicans, these two clans were excluded from the sovereignty. Through a parliamentary decision, the other Sigonians banished the two clans to the desert, and even declared Avgins autonomous, thus absolving themselves of responsibility should any future conflicts occur between the two clans. Second Katica-Avgin Extinction Event. During one Kakava, the Katicans launched a massive attack on the Avgins, who were under the protection of the IPC. The attack absolutely decimated the Avgin population, resulting in 6,728 deaths and 3,452 missing. Aventurine was likely the sole Avgin survivor of this attack."}

Silver Screen Shockwave, Episode 280 Express Movie Review of the MonthMovie Critic: Chabro 01: \"Life's a Soda\"Genre: Youth\/Romance\/MusicalRating: 2.5\/10Comment: An annoyingly lengthy commercial for SoulGlad.Review:I have a lot of respect for SoulGlad for sparing no expense in hiring A-list actors to feature in this crappy movie that lasts for 2 hours. Ironically, even the effect of a half-minute commercial is better than this. It seems to me that Penacony is doing extremely well economically these days, or the Alfalfa Family wouldn't be wasting their money like this. All the characters in this film remind me of Mr. Soda in \"Clockie\", with their brains filled with SoulGlad. The protagonist meets the love of his life after picking up a bottle of SoulGlad, making a name for himself by selling SoulGlad, and rising to become the festive superstar by singing the SoulGlad advertisement jingles. The movie ends with everyone dancing with a bottle of SoulGlad in their hands in a scene where SoulGlad is overflowing everywhere... Holy moly, there's more SoulGlad in this flop than I've seen in my entire life! Come to think of it, this film is probably a success in terms of promoting SoulGlad. After all, after two torturous hours of watching the movie, the audience desperately needs something nice to drink to soothe their battered souls. 02: \"Insect Cyclone: The Sixteen-Headed Insect\"Genre: Disaster\/ThrillerRating: 1\/10Comment: One of a kind in terms of floppinessReview:When \"Insect Cyclone: The Three-Headed Insect\" first came out, I didn't expect a film of such poor quality could have so many sequels. So, when I saw its 13th sequel making it to the box office chart, I had no intention of wasting any more ink on this film made of tacky special effects and an AI-generated script. However, I must criticize those who have contributed to its box office that when you buy a ticket for this film, you are filling Grady Films's grave. In terms of cinematography, this film is a 0. The one point is for its art team, who managed to design an insect monster with 16 heads, 32 pairs of wings, and 64 limbs \u2014 it's surely no easy feat. If they can pull off a monster with more heads in the next sequel, I'll consider giving the film another 0.5 points. 03: \"Meme Crisis\" (Dream Bubble Remake)Genre: Thriller\/Adventure\/Dream BubbleRating: 2.5\/10Comment: A terrible attempt of rehashing an old film.Review:When \"Meme Crisis\" was released back then, I gave it a score of 5. If you have read enough of my reviews in \"Silver Screen Shockwave\", you will know that this is one of the higher scores I've given. Regrettably, Grady Films seems to be too vested in trying to add more heads to the insects nowadays. Not only does the most advanced dream bubble technology fail to capture the essence of the original film, but it also ruins what's good about it. The director has zero clue about the difference between a dream bubble narrative and using cinematography to tell the narrative. It only repeatedly forces the audience to go through a non-interactive process and read a bunch of dialogue that has nothing to do with them as the narrator. This is funny \u2014 if a dream bubble movie is only about moving the scenes in a film into a dream bubble, then I might as well just lie on the couch and watch the original film. If you are interested in this movie, I'd suggest that you get an old DVD of the original film instead of wasting your money and time on this trashy dream bubble. 04: \"Clockie: Mecha Town\"Genre: Animation\/Comedy\/AdventureRating: 4.5\/10Comment: A cookie-cutter film that lacks in originality.Review:As we all know, \"Clockie\" is the most popular animated film in Dreamscape. It is the most renowned work by Clock Studios and one of the most valuable cartoon characters in the universe. Nevertheless, due to the success of \"Clockie\", Clock Studios seems to be resting on its laurels and settling in complacency, as evidenced by \"Clockie: Mecha Town\"! The plot structure of this animated film is almost identical to \"Clockie: Cyber Town\" from last year. Both films start with Dreamville facing a crisis, followed by Clockie searching for help, and making new friends, and end with Clockie rescuing the whole town by relying on friendship and teamwork... The same plot has been used over and over again. Don't the producers find it a snoozefest? For first-timers, the film is definitely an excellent animated film. But if you are a fan of Clockie who has already watched films of the series numerous times, there are no surprises in stock for you. Recommendation of the MonthRecommended by: Chabro A Fading NebulaGenre: War\/Drama\/MysteryRating: 9\/10Comment: An unparalleled masterpiece.Review:This film is a classic piece by one of the most famous directors in the cosmos: Mr. Reca. Once again, he demonstrates his exceptional talent in this film. \"A Fading Nebula\" integrates the clashing ideas between reality and romance, tenderness and brutality, as well as life and death in the 1,500 shots that make up the 200-minute film. The story took place in the Slaturg Nebula that fell half an Amber Era ago. Mr. Reca makes the Intellitron leader who rules the nebula the protagonist and depicts the happenings during the final six months of the nebula from the leader's perspective. Just like Mr. Reca's past works, the film has a realistic and delicate touch that makes the viewers feel like they are walking down the protagonist's memory lane. The lesser-known actors are truly into their characters, the plot is suspenseful, and the editing is masterful... These are enough to make \"A Fading Nebula\" a movie remembered by history. Rewatching this film makes me reminisce about the time when I was pursuing my dream in the past... It is unlikely that I can create something as outstanding as this film at my age, but I hope that with my words, I can bring awareness to the movie industry that we need more great artistes like Mr. Reca! Note: According to the information received by our journalists, it seems that Mr. Reca has developed an interest in dream bubble technology and is preparing a dream bubble film. This is truly a piece of delightful news for every cinephile. I believe his work will bring a breath of fresh air to the currently lackluster cinema and revitalize the industry!"}

The gameplay revolves around collecting upgrades, known as Blessings to enhance the team's power and completing stages containing progressively more difficult enemies. It is the source for, which can be used to buy items from Herta's Store. Overview. In Simulated Universe, there are 9 worlds that have to be beaten in order. Each world has multiple difficulty levels that unlock as the player increases their Trailblaze Level. Each difficulty will grant rewards upon first-time completion, but can be replayed for other rewards such as enemy loot, Relic EXP Material, and opportunities to claim Planar Ornaments using Trailblaze Power or Immersifiers. At the start of each playthrough, the player may choose a Path to follow, which will grant Path-specific buffs and an increased chance to obtain Blessings of the corresponding Path. During the playthrough, the player will complete different types of Domains (Combat, Occurrence, Transaction, Encounter, Elite, Respite) with the end goal of arriving at the final Boss Domain and defeating the boss. For more information on Domains, see Simulated Universe\/Worlds. Blessings, Curios will be accumulated through various means, which provide a variety of passive effects and buffs to the team. Blessings can be upgraded through Occurrences or within Respite Domains to enhance their effects. A currency known as s will also be obtained which can be used in certain Random Events or to upgrade Blessings. Destructible objects can be found in Domains which provide Cosmic Fragments, healing, or Technique Points. If the entire team is defeated at any point in the playthrough, they will lose their current progress, including Domain progress, Cosmic Fragments, Blessings, and Curios and will have to start over. When a playthrough ends, either by completing the last domain or by being defeated, the player will obtain weekly points and Ability Tree points. Accumulated weekly points allow the player to claim time-limited rewards that refresh every week, while Ability Tree points allow the player to unlock permanent upgrades in the Ability Tree. Every new Occurrence, Curio and amount of Blessings the player obtains for a specific Path will reward players with set amounts of Stellar Jade; for every new Curio and Occurrence, and for obtaining all Blessings in a given Path. A Blessing or Curio that the player has not unlocked will be indicated with a book-like icon at the top right corner of the respective item. Expansion Module. Expansion Module consists of special modes of the Simulated Universe, Swarm Disaster and Gold and Gears. A playthrough in such modes consists of 3 planes; a beginning, middle and end plane. The first plane is moderately populated, the second plane is heavily populated and the final plane is fairly small. At the end of the first two planes, the player can choose between two bosses, which provide additional effects when facing the final boss. The player also has a set planar count to reach the end as quick as possible; if the player's count reaches 0, they will enter the Planar Disarray state for every movement made, increasing its level by one; each level increases the enemies' ATK by 5% and DMG reduction by 4%. After level 10, enemies will have a 25% SPD increase which increases by 5% for every level afterwards. In addition to the regular Domain types, Expansion Module modes feature Adventure and Reward domains. It also has its own ability tree. Certain Curios and Occurrences are exclusive to Expansion Module modes. Unlike the original Simulated Universe, the expansion modules do not award planar ornaments, but instead an array of various ascension materials. Point Rewards. Points are collected based on a player's progress throughout the Simulated Universe. After accumulating a set amount of points, a player will receive a variety of rewards such as, , s,, , and . When a player's Equilibrium Level increases, the player's points tier will also increase. This increases the amount of rewards a player will receive. The score can be easily achieved by completing a world or plane of high difficulty, though they can also clear lower planes repeatedly to accumulate score. Rewards are reset once every week on Monday at 4:00 (Server Time). Collecting points during Simulated Universe exploration grants the following rewards: Lore. A project jointly made by four members of the Genius Society: Herta, who provides the venue, personnel and resources for the project, Ruan Mei, a master in the field of creation who cultivated the protoplasm simulating the Aeons, Screwllum, who is responsible for writing the underlying logic of the program and the algoritm for the galaxy, and Stephen Lloyd. Its objective is to find the truth about Aeons, how were they created, why were they created and what were they created for. The four geniuses wrote a program together that simulates the universe, just like our universe, but more streamlined and customized. In layman's terms, the simulated universe will also simulate the Aeons themselves and we can ask them questions. The false Aeons have connected with real Paths, so you can say that they have created a bunch of powerless mini gods in their Simulated Universe. The simulated Aeons have no concept of free will and will usually ignore everyone and only care about their destined Path, just like the real ones, so when asked questions, they simply ignore them. Therefore, by setting the Trailblazer's identity to the deceased Aeon of Trailblaze Akivili, Herta hopes to attract other Aeons, based on the logic that it may be easier for Aeons to communicate directly with each other, and learn from them. Combat is an essential part of the Simulated Universe's design because it is the best way to demonstrate which Path one is likely to walk and the simulated Aeons can only be summoned when theres is a connection to a Path. Based on the combat tendencies used, the corresponding Path should produce an resonance and Aeons following the same Path would be drawn in."}

{"url":"https:\/\/honkai-star-rail.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=4611","text":"Simulated Universe\/Worlds Jump to Domain Overview. Currently, there are 9 Worlds in the Simulated Universe. Each World consists of a chain of Domains, each modeled after different areas. To complete the World, the Trailblazer needs to complete all the domains, including the Boss in the last domain. Completing a World awards a certain number of Points, which can be used to obtain Point Rewards. In World 3 or later, they will also award Ability Points which can be used to unlock permanent upgrades in the Ability Tree. If the run ends early \u2014 for example, when the team is defeated \u2014 Points and Ability Points will still be awarded up to the domain completed. Planar Ornaments. When successfully completing an Elite or Boss domain in a main world, the player will have the option to exchange or for Planar Ornaments, similar to completing a Cavern of Corrosion. Elites provide one exchange opportunity while Bosses provide two, for a total of up to four exchanges per run. Leaving the domain or finalizing the run will forfeit any unused exchanges; however, the player can temporarily leave the Simulated Universe via the \"Leave for Now\" menu option and make the exchange(s) after returning at a later time. Note that the weekly reset will force-finalize any ongoing runs. Extra Drops. Defeating enemies in Elite domains (main worlds only) and Boss domains can grant extra drops of materials, s, and s. Higher difficulty grants more rewards, and the amount increases in the second and final Elite\/Boss domains respectively. Players can earn 100 times of extra drops a week. Extra drop availability is refreshed upon Weekly Reset. In Gold and Gears, if the player completes the Plane's Bonus Reward Target via keeping Cognition Value within the required Cognition Range, double the amount of extra drops can be earned from that Plane. Domains. There are 7 types of Domains in the main Simulated Universe Worlds. The first domain encountered is always Combat and the last domain is always Boss. These domains typically contain 1-3 waves of Normal Enemies. Of these, only the enemy directly next to the portal to the next domain must be defeated in order to move on. Much like in the overworld, enemies within close proximity of each other will be grouped into a multi-wave battle. Each wave in turn grants a 1-2 star Blessing, regardless if they are fought separately or consecutively. These domains may contain a, , or . For every Trotter defeated, an extra 1-3 star Blessing may be selected. These domains contain an Elite Enemy. In the main Simulated Universe Worlds, Defeating the Elite Enemy will grant a 3-star Blessing, a Curio, and a single chance to exchange for Planar Ornaments. In the Expansion Module, defeating the Elite Enemy will only grant a 1-3 star Blessing. In World 2 and higher, the first Elite domain will contain a normal-variant Elite Enemy, while the second Elite domain will contain one of the (Bug) variant. If a battle in an Elite domain exceeds 20 cycles, the enemy will gain 1 stack of Berserk every cycle, with each stack increasing their DMG dealt by 40%. A warning message regarding it will appear upon reaching 18 cycles, and it will appear on the Action Order as a red line. (Bug) Enemies. These unique variants of Elite Enemies possess increased stats and deadlier abilities. These domains contain a portrait that starts an Occurrence, which are short pieces of narration that give miscellaneous rewards. Depending on the specific Occurrence and the player's choice(s), In the main Worlds, possible Occurrences are those that don't appear in the Transaction and Encounter domains. In the main Worlds, these domains contain a portrait that starts an Occurrence where the player can choose to exchange various resources for Blessings or Curios. These domains contain a portrait that starts an Occurrence. In contrast to the regular Occurrence domains, the Occurrences found in Encounter domains will usually force the player to defeat one or more Elite Enemies in exchange for greater rewards. These domains can be encountered right before Boss domains, and right after Elite domains in the main Worlds. These domains contain: In the first and second Respite domains, the player can select one of the following options from Herta. She will disappear after selecting any option. In the final Respite domain, the player can purchase Enhancements for specific Blessings. The final domain of every world, containing Elite or Boss Enemies that must be defeated to complete the world or plane. In the main Worlds, defeating the Boss grants 2 chances to exchange for Planar Ornaments. If a battle in a Boss domain exceeds 32 cycles, the enemy will gain 1 stack of Berserk every cycle, with each stack increasing their DMG dealt by 40%. A warning message regarding it will appear upon reaching 30 cycles, and it will appear on the Action Order as a red line. (Complete) Enemies. Bosses in these domains will always use their \"Complete\" variant, which includes increased stats, additional phases, and much deadlier abilities. These domains contain Occurrences that typically grant high-tier rewards, including Blessings, Curios, Blessing upgrades, etc. These domains contain a character Downloader and one of the following minigames: Three tiers of rewards can be obtained depending on the amount of objectives met: Avoiding the Beams Challenge. There are 6 Cycles and no time limit. Techniques are disabled during the challenge. Objectives: Successfully evading for all 6 Cycles rewards the Achievement \"Evasive Reflex\". Barrel Breaker Challenge. One of the following stages is randomly selected. Each stage contains 30 barrels, with a time limit of 30 seconds. Goals: Lucky Compass Challenge. There is no time limit. The rotation speed of each ring is indicated by the number of dots on it. Goals: There is a chance of different encounters in place of the chests: Having 3 hands pointed toward the same straight line rewards the Achievement \"Wheel of Destiny\". Trotter Catch. The time limit is 30 seconds. Points: Goals: Capturing all 16 Trotters rewards the Achievement \"Harvest Moon\". Transaction domains in the Expansion Module differ from those found in regular Simulated Universe. Instead of an Occurrence, Transaction domains will contain a Reviver and projections of Herta and Screwllum who have a random selection of Curios and Blessings respectively which the player can purchase using Cosmic Fragments. The cost of purchasable items may be affected by certain Curios. Curio Store. The Curio Store has 3 random Curios in stock, with two costing and the other costing . Blessing Store. The Blessing Store has 6 random Blessings in stock. These domains do not generate naturally, but are instead created through the use of certain Audience Dice. If embarking on the Path of Nihility in, these domains will be replaced with the content of another random Domain type. Otherwise, they will only contain destructible objects. These domains contain and . While in combat, if there are less than 5 enemies on the field, additional enemies will periodically spawn. For every wave of enemies defeated, the player can claim a 1-3 star Blessing of Propagation. These domains contain Occurrences related to the Swarm. For most Paths, these Occurrences typically contain the option of fighting and in exchange for Blessings of Propagation. Additionally, The Swarm's alertness can be affected by choices in these domains. After greatly increasing The Swarm's alertness 1\/2 times, the player will begin encountering events of the Second\/Third Praetorian, which are significantly more dangerous. When embarking on the Path of Propagation, the Occurrences encountered in these domains will instead involve making sacrifices in order to improve the quality of later rewards. Making sacrifices will increase the current Praetorian level, while claiming rewards will decrease it. This is the final domain in Plane 3 of Swarm Disaster. It contains a . These domains contain Occurrences that are exceptionally dangerous or otherwise high-risk. These domains contain special Occurrences that allow the player to adjust their Intra-Cognition value in addition to offering minor rewards. Domain Layout. In World 2 or later, the layout contains 13 domains generated under certain rules. Before Domain \u2014 Divergence, two options are randomly generated for the player to enter."}

It was chosen as a subject of experimentation by Ruan Mei, in an attempt to cultivate life and develop a further understanding of Emanators. Profile. Skaracabaz was once one of the nightmares across multiple worlds during the Swarm Disaster. As an Emanator, its mandibles were directly inherited from Tayzzyronth. Its death ray could fragment celestial bodies and it made shattered stars incubators for procreating offspring. Ruan Mei described Skaracabaz as \"primitive and pure\" in contrast to other Emanators, likely due to belonging to The Swarm. It was for this reason that she chose Skaracabaz as the subject for her experiments, with information gathered from the Simulated Universe. The results of her experiments led to the creation of of the Emanator residing at the base of Herta Space Station's Seclusion Zone. The status of the original Skaracabaz is unknown. However, it is unlikely that it survived beyond the Swarm Disaster and Tayzzyronth themselves. Skaracabaz likely belongs to a similar species as . Synthetic Clone. As a clone, Skaracabaz laid incubating in a large egg sac in the Seclusion Zone. Sometime before being discovered by The Trailblazer, this clone escaped the egg sac and attempted to ambush them. The clone was alleged to be powerful enough to destroy the entirety of Herta Space Station. However, after 56 seconds, the clone abruptly dissipated into particles, ultimately being unable to sustain its own existence. Ruan Mei states that this was the expected outcome, and that her \"incomplete\" creation \"doesn't hold a candle to the Emanator\"."}
