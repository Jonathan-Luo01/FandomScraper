In the middle game, you can use an or a instead. Consider using any Pet whose health doesn't matter (, Monkey, etc.) behind a front position Badger, since it's attacks likely won't matter anyway. However, you still run the risk of your low attack pet fainting before it can soak up badger's attack, resulting in your badger destroying something important.

The Blobfish is the only aquatic animal in the game to be depicted inside a pressurized tank. This is due to the fact that Blobfish have gelatinous bodies; when taken out into the open air, their body experiences rapid decompression, turning them mushy and killing them. While this is the look that many are familiar with, the artists opted to take a more accurate approach to its art design. (Link: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Psychrolutidae)"}

This can be guaranteed by putting that pet at 1 health: by letting it get hurt by the Leech prior to this turn, feeding it, or giving it a then so it will respawn as 1\/1. Alternatively, putting on the Leech will allow it to knock out a base stats Chipmunk\/Toucan\/Seagull immediately. At the end of turn, Parrot will copy Seagull's ability, Leech will knock out the pet in front. When this pet respawns, the Parrot will give it Coconut. If a Chipmunk was given Coconut, sell it to spawn a Coconut in the shop, then give this Coconut to the Seagull. If a Toucan was given Coconut, Pill it in front of the Seagull. If the Seagull was given Coconut, we are almost on our way to a full Coconut team. Buying new pets will trigger the Seagull's ability, and they will receive Coconut. Having a high level Seagull or buying more Seagulls will speed up this process. Step 3: Chipmunk. In order to achieve a full Coconut team that isn't stuck with a Seagull, we'll need to finish one last step. Buy a then sell it for a Coconut in the shop.

Merging one copy of a Pet with another gives the first Pet 1 experience point, as well as a +1\/+1 stat boost. Merging a Pet that has higher stats with a Pet that has lower stats will result in the higher stats being chosen before applying the +1\/+1 boost. For example, merging a Pet from the shop with another will give the Pet 1 experience. When Pets are merged, their experience is also combined.

Pelican's key strength as a scaler is it's low requirements. Most scalers in Super Auto Pets either require themselves or their targets to be in a specific position, such as Giraffe or Monkey, or for the team composition to meet certain criteria, such as Dragonfly or Poodle. Pelican, however, requires neither, making it less of a headache to fit into a team. Pelican is also the earliest form of reliable end-of-turn scaling in Star Pack that isn't either self-targeted or inconsistent, giving it a usable niche. However, Pelican's requirement becomes an increasingly harsh burden to bear as the game progresses. Generally, a high-stat unit should be given some sort of defensive food, such as a Lemon or Pepper. If your strongest unit has a Strawberry in the later turns of the game, it'll be vulnerable to other high-stat units using more defensively- oriented equipment, and the buff Pelican gives at the end of turn is not high enough to replace a Pepper or Melon.

The Silver Fox is a very strong pet for gaining money as it is sure to at least give you 1 (the value of a level 1 ) or at max 9 (the value of a level 3 ).

At the start of battle, the Skunk will reduce the health of the highest health enemy by a percentage of its total health, rounded up. Leveling up the Skunk will increase the percentage number that the enemy's health is reduced by. Strategy. Skunk is an anti-scaling pet that forces the enemy to build a well rounded team with multiple high stat pets instead of putting all their eggs in one basket. It shines best when matched against teams with a single beefy enemy such as teams. At level 3, Skunk will instantly cripple an enemy down to 1 health, and effectively allow the rest of the pets on your team to clean up afterward. It should be noted that Skunk's ability is incapable of directly knocking out an enemy and will always need follow up damage to defeat them. This can be problematic against defensive food perks like that may allow the originally high health enemy pet to still get one or multiple attacks off. Pairing Skunk with snipers like or even can mitigate this issue and eliminate the problematic enemy immediately. Stacking multiple Skunks with is another strong strategy that can wipe out a full scaling team. If you're running a scaling focused team, there are next to no counters against Skunk beside just scaling more pets. Though as powerful as it is, Skunk is extremely ineffective against summon teams, as they tend to have low health to begin with and instead swarm the enemy with high attack."}

On every roll, including the automatic shop roll at the start of turn, it has a 1\/10,000 (0.01%) chance of appearing in the left-most unfrozen space in the pet shop. Sloth also has the chance to replace the when it's summoned. The Sloth has no abilities. Strategy. Sloth is the ultimate bragging right. Not only because of its incredibly rare chance to show up, but also due to having the lowest base stats in the game and no abilities, should you choose to buy it, it will be an immense burden on your team. Winning with a Sloth often means winning with 4 usable slots on the team, and winning with a level 3 Sloth means you're capable of winning with any pet in the game. The Sloth ribbon is the definite proof of your prowess in Super Auto Pets. It will always show up when you least expect it, and oftentimes on runs that cannot afford to bring along a deadweight. Since the chance of finding more Sloths on the same run is vanishingly small, in order to level it up, you'll have to rely on other methods such as hunting for, , etc. Remember that it has no abilities, so any experiences spent on the Sloth would've been much better off given to another pet. There are no strategies we can give you that will help you win Sloth runs. When it shows up in the shop, we hope that you freeze it, eventually buy it, and we wish you the best of luck on your amazing journey with our lovable furry friend. For the Sloth Ribbon, we want two accomplishments: to win 10 times, and to have a level 3 sloth. Each accomplishment is hard enough already, but the combination of accomplishing both makes this achievement nigh impossible. Sloths want three things in life: time (they're slow), chocolates (they're addicted), and POWER (from other pets, of course). Strategy by Cleanup141. Cleanup141 is a guy who helps players get their ribbon in his free time. The problem of Time: imagine that you have a godly start to your run, and by end of turn 4, you have 4\/10 trophies and well on your way to a FLAWLESS victory. Then you see a Sloth on turn 9 when chocolates start showing up, and your arena run is about to end already. How do we solve this? Intentionally lose in turns 1-4, the target is to have 7 lives. Try to draw as much as you can rounds 1-10 so you can target finishing your arena run at rounds 14-16. The problem of Chocolates: imagine that you have a crazy food build going and you're eating Pizza left and right, your team is STACKED. Then at 8 trophies, you realize your Sloth is only level one and you need to spend 15 of your remaining 20 gold on chocolates. No problem right? WRONG. The probability of finding 5 chocolates to eat with 20 gold remaining is actually around 0.1%, that is only 1 in 1000 chance! You need to plan your run, on average you need to spend 10 gold to roll and buy a chocolate. The problem of POWER: Not only is the sloth the weakest unit in the game gameplay-wise and takes up a slot on your team, his chocolate addiction also drains resources from others. You can have a crazy food build with Cats, Seals, and Squirrels, but you may not be able to buy food because the Sloth needs his Chocolate. That is why passive scaling (Penguin, Monkey, Bison, etc.) is recommended. On 7\/10 trophies and rolling for chocolates, you need your team to get continually stronger without spending effort to do so. There is a world where food scaling is possible (when all the cats fall in your lap), but its not an easy path. Ultimately, if you can balance all three of these, you will find yourself with the best chance of the sloth ribbon! Keyword though: chance. You can do everything right but get unlucky and never see enough Chocolates. Just have fun and try not to stress out too much about it. Some things are just not meant to be. Sloth hunting. Anglerfish. The easiest way to get a Sloth is simply let others find it for you. Then, through 's ability, we can steal it from them. If you're matched against a Sloth team while having one or more Anglerfishes frozen in the shop, buying them will grant at minimum a 40% chance of getting the Sloth, which is a substantial increase from 0.01%. All we need is for one person to carry a Sloth till turn 9 or further, then others will be able to copy that Sloth for themselves and the Sloth economy will inflate. Sharing is caring! POT Combo. There is a way to force the Sloth to show up in an already good run, to make sure you have everything necessary for the Sloth ribbon, although it won't be much less painful or luck-based than finding one in the wild. Using Custom pack and a setup with, and, you can achieve a loopable gold generating cycle, allowing you to roll nigh-indefinitely until a Sloth finally shows up. This requires a lot of technical skills and also plenty of luck. It will not give you free wins, and is not in any way a good \"hunting\" method, although it is the best one we have in the current version of the game.

When the Tapir faints, it will summon a copy of a random pet currently on the team, with the same level as the Tapir. Tapir cannot summon another Tapir. It will not summon anything if the team doesn't have any valid targets, or if it's the last pet on the team. Strategy. The Tapir is one of the most flexible and powerful summoner, but with a high skill ceiling to utilize it properly. It's most useful for summoning teams, pairing well with things like, ,, and so on. Tapir can be used to force a specific summon. Giving a pet on the team can make all Tapirs target that pet to summon, as long as it doesn't get sniped and knocked out. Tapir also doesn't summon Tapirs, so a full team of Tapirs with another pet in the last position will continuously summon that pet. This is often used on Eagle for very strong and potentially infinite Tapir &gt; Eagle &gt; Tapir chains, but it can be applied to any pet of your choosing. The sky is the limit! Tapir can be bought and to gain a copy of a pet on the team, this costs 4 gold so is often not recommended, but Donut can help with giving the exact copy that you want. POT Combo. The P.O.T. -, and combo, is a niche setup capable of continuously generating gold in a single turn, allowing for nigh-indefinite rolling and... that's all it can do. This combo can't use the gold for anything else since it cannot afford anymore spaces, has no scaling synergies, and requires luck to keep going. It's used exclusively by hunters, trying to force it to show up by rolling as many times as they can. Because you cannot spend the gold on anything but rolling and regenerating gold, it's recommended, if not \"required\", that the shop to be scaled to at least 40\/40 before pivoting to POT. It's also recommended to put the in the pack, it will keep track of gold spent on the current turn, and you will get to see the numbers go up to the hundreds, if not thousands. The setup is as follow:, with, and level 3 with . Then, the Tapir will spawn a level 3 Tapir and 2 level 3 Oysters, thanks to Mushroom and Pteranodon's ability. Each level 3 Oyster is 12 gold, so by selling them, you will quickly hit the gold cap at 30. Now all we need to do is roll and keep an eye out for: Since the gold cap is 30, you cannot just Mushroom Pill the Tapir whenever you want and stack up lots of gold. Instead you will oftentimes have to spend the gold, sell the Oysters to free up spaces, then find Mushroom Pill to repeat the process. Managing gold correctly is the hardest part of the combo, but even then, you can still get unlucky with the foods and run out of gold anyway. Should you find the Sloth, it will be trivial to pivot to a winning team thanks to shop scaling, and you should have plenty of gold to get it to level 3. Another way to achieve the level 3 Sloth is giving it Donut, selling the Donutted Oyster, then pilling the Tapir."}

{"url":"https:\/\/superautopets.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=295","text":"Whale The Whale is a Pet, available in the Turtle Pack. At the start of battle, the Whale will cause the nearest friend ahead to faint. Then when the Whale faints, it will summon a level 1 copy of that friend. Levelling up the Whale increases the level of the summoned friend. Summoned friend's stats will be their base stats multiplied by the Whale\u2019s level. They are also considered \"new\" pets, with no memory of their old selves before being swallowed. For example if a was swallowed, it will not keep the copied abilities. Whale is \"not\" considered a Faint pet, and does not synergize with pets that call for Faint abilities. If a Whale is knocked out at the start of battle, regardless of ability order, it will always faint the nearest available friend ahead then immediately resummon that friend. Strategy. Whale synergies well with all Faint pets. Pairing it with a to summon the immediately, then later the Whale will also summon another Deer. Pairing it with to gain multiple . to get multiple stats buffs. It also works if the friend ahead has, for example Whale + + Mushroom will give you 2 instakills. A high level Whale will double\/triple the swallowed pet's base stats. So if there's a newly bought pet with low stats, Whale can be useful to multiply their stats as well as level. It also has one of the highest base stats for a tier 4, so it can still be a good temporary pick even if there's nothing to synergize with. Whale is generally put into the second slot of your team so that if the pet it's supposed to swallow gets sniped, it won't then swallow the next pet in front of it. For example with a team like Whale, Deer,, if a snipes and knocks out the Deer, the Whale will then swallow the Bison and you'll be very sad. A special interaction is with . Putting Tiger behind the Whale will cause it to swallow up to 2 friends ahead, then summon all of them on faint."}

{"url":"https:\/\/superautopets.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2071","text":"Wolverine The Wolverine is a Pet, available in the Turtle Pack. The Wolverine buffs the damage done by abilities to the adjacent friends. Levelling the Wolverine up increases the damage buff. Strategy. The Wolverine pairs well with pets that have sniping abilities, particularly those that fire multiple shots. Notable examples include the Woodpecker, Blowfish (especially behind Elephant), and Octopus. Each time a pet fires, the damage is increased. So, in the case of Woodpecker at Level 3, even a Level 1 Wolverine will increase the total damage output of the Woodpecker by 3 damage times 6 shots for overall 18 more damage. With a Level 3 Wolverine, this increases all the way to 54 extra damage. This concept also applies to pets like the Lionfish that can fire many times. Trivia. This pet was not originally in the turtle pack, but was retconned by big Pet at a undisclosed later date."}
{"url":"https:\/\/superautopets.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=621","text":"Wombat The Wombat is a Pet, available in Custom packs and sometimes available in the Weekly Pack. Upon entering battle, the Wombat copies the highest Tier opposing Pet's Faint Ability. Strategy. The Wombat is a risky pet to use because it solely relies on which pets the opponent is using. Sometimes it will provide a lot of value and win games, and sometimes it won't have anything to copy. Usually the viability of the Wombat relies on outside factors - the amount of pets with Faint abilities in the pack and the current meta. Wombat isn't very good at level 1 because it's outperformed by pets with consistent and reliable Faint abilities like, but it's solid at levels 2 and 3, especially when levelled early, because it can one-up the opponent's Faint pets. When scaled, the Wombat is one of the most effective pets to be paired with because it has a beneficial ability that can make it as effective as a Tier 5 or 6 pet. Beware that it's pretty inconsistent and pets like and are better in this situation. Wombat can be great in Versus Mode when you know what your opponents are using because it's more predictable and consistent."}

At the start of battle the Woodpecker deals 2 damage to the two pets in front of it, friend or foe. Levelling up the Woodpecker increases the amount of times its ability will trigger at the start of battle. Strategy. The Woodpecker can be used in a variety of different ways including triggering hurt abilities, breaking peppers and melons. You can also put on the Wood pecker to make it do more damage.*Triggering hurt abilities could give your team a stat boost at the start of battle. Pets like the, and can benefit from the Woodpecker."}

Levelling up the Worm increases the stats given by the stocked Apple. Strategy. Worm is best when paired with a Cat, as the doubled buffs can stack very easily. A single level three Cat paired with a level three Worm will give a Best Apple with 12\/12 buffs."}
{"url":"https:\/\/superautopets.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=512","text":"Yak The Yak is a Tier 2 Pet in the Star Pack. At the end of the turn, it deals one damage to itself and gains attack. Levelling up the Yak increases the amount of attack it gains. Strategy. The Yak is a rather underwhelming pet, being quickly outclassed and only synergising with Koala. It's still good when leveled up on turns 3-5 and there's a Koala on the team, making it gain stats very quickly and overpower other early-game self-scalers like Puppy and Cassowary. Yak is a good pet for tempo during turns 3 and 4 thanks to its above-average stats - it can be bought if there's nothing better in the shop. However, it should always be sold when there's a better pet in the shop. It's not recommended to keep Yak in the late-game - it damages itself even with maxed Attack, meaning it can't use Melon or Pepper because they will automatically be consumed at the start of turn. The Yak's stats can be swapped with a high-tier pet like a Sabertooth using a level 2 or level 3 Frog so they don't get wasted when selling the Yak."}

Leveling up the Zebra will increase the size of the stat buff it gives each time it is triggered. Strategy. The Zebra is a very useful pet, effectively giving +4\/+4 for a total of 2 gold. While the Zebra is always a decent pet to buy and sell assuming you have an open slot, it truly excels when paired with the buy-sell strategy, as its buff will compound with those of your buy-sell pets such as and . The Zebra also synergizes with the, as a level 2 Alpaca will immediately level up a Zebra on summon, effectively doubling its buff. "}
