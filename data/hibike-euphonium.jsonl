{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6567","text":"Timpani, also called Kettledrums, is an instrument in the percussion family. Someone who plays the timpani is called a timpanist.Construction.It is a large bowl-shaped drum, typically made of copper, with a membrane, called the drum head, stretched across the top, which can be tightened or loosened to play different notes when struck.Performance.The timpani is one of the most difficult percussion instruments to play. Players are required to quickly and accurately tune each drum accordingly, by using the pedals at their feet. These pedals are connected to the 6-8 tension rods which control the tightness of the drum head. However, this mechanism is much more practical than early timpani, which had to be manually tuned by twisting or untwisting a series of screws, which would also change the pitch of the instrument. Because pieces sometimes call for quick changing of pitch while performing, timpanists often sit, unlike other percussionists, lest they lose balance or change the pitch inappropriately as a result. On some models, gauges connected to the pedal exist that can help a player tune to a note without listening for intonation.Striking the drum also requires a great degree of skill. As timpani are most often used as a rhythmic tool, the timpanist requires a good sense of rhythm. Additionally, players must determine which mallet will be appropriate for each passage. The timpani's part can often be exhaustive, requiring rolls (formally called \"tremolo\"), the quick repeated beating of the drum to provide a sustained effect. These can last up to several minutes in length. Generally, the drum is struck four inches away from the rim, but this can change depending on the desired effect.The length of the note produced can be controlled by the player by pressing their hand against the drum head after it is struck. This will mute the drum, and can be used to provide a more staccato effect.A \"portamento\" effect (not to be confused with glissando) can be achieved by changing the tuning of the drum immediately after having struck it.Scoring.The timpani is an essential member of symphony orchestras, concert bands, and as part of marching band front ensembles. It is standard to have a single part written for 4-5 individual timpani. In many cases, like orchestras, they are the only pitched .Timpani have their own part in musical scores, unlike most other percussion instruments which fall under \"Percussion 1, 2, 3, etc..\". This is because timpanists typically do not switch instruments throughout a piece, and in many professional ensembles, the timpanist only plays timpani, rather than switching between instruments like a regular percussionist.Miyoko Oono plays the timpani in several pieces, such as Crescent Moon Dance.Motoko Higashiura plays the timpani in \"Liz and the Blue Bird\"."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=7871","text":"Tom-tom, also simply called the tom, is an instrument in the percussion family. A musician who plays the tom-tom is called a \"tom-tom drummer\" or simply a \"tom-tom player\".Construction.The tom-tom drum consists of a cylindrical shell made of wood or man-made materials like fiberglass with a diameter usually between 15 cm (6\") to 46 cm (18\"). It also has metal hardware including rims, tension rods, and mounting systems. Lastly, it has a head that is struck to produce sound.The tom differs from the snare drum in that it does not have snares inside. Otherwise, structurally, they are near identical.Variants.Concert Tom\/Single-headed.Toms used in drumkits have two heads, one on top and one on the bottom, however \"concert toms\" only have one head. They have been used in drumkits in the past but fell off in popularity many decades ago.Tenor Drum.\"Tenor drums\" are actually a broader type of drum that toms fall under (the distinction being tenor drums aren't necessarily cylindrical). However, they are more often than not classified as the same. Tenor drums are most often used in marching bands in sets of multis, including two (duos), three (tris\/trios\/triples), four (quads), five (quints), or six (sextets\/six-pack\/hexes\/tenors). Often the term \"quads\" can refer to any number greater than 4.Floor Tom.The \"floor tom\" is a standard member of drum kits. It resides on the floor to the right of the player. It is usually as deep as it is wide in diameter, and usually mounted on three legs. It is pitched between regular toms and the bass drum.Rototoms.\"Rototoms\" are small, shellless drums that only have a head and frame. They are usually mounted in sets of three, and can be rotated to change their pitch. In essence, they are like a crossbreed between the timpani and tom-tom. As such, they are often used to train timpani students due to their small size and portability, as well as most of the techniques carrying over.Octoban.The \"octoban\", also called \"tube tom\" is a deep, narrow, single-headed drum. They were originally featured in tuned sets of 8, or a whole octave, hence the name. Sets of two, four, or eight drums are a common addition to drumsets. They are usually placed to the left of the player, above the hi-hat.Performance.Tom-toms tend not to be the main focus when used, and instead add colour to pieces. However, in some ensembles like marching bands, toms are used extensively and may end up providing a somewhat melodic role, especially in percussion solos. Sometimes this can be done in conjunction with the bass drum when they are a part of a drumkit, particularly with the floor tom to provide a deep, intense beat.Scoring.Toms are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, symphony orchestras, and marching bands, as well as in pop, rock, hip-hop, and other genres through use of drumkits.Toms are typically the least used of the big four members of the drumkit (snares, kicks, cymbals, and toms).Toms are used by Narai Tanabe as a part of the drumkit in \"Takarajima\" and \"Gakuen Tengoku\".Toms are used in movement 2 of Liz and the Blue Bird."}

During the time leading up to auditions, Tomoe began to notice pain in her jaw when she played. Eventually, it started becoming difficult to play high notes, so she visited a doctor who diagnosed her with arthritis. She consulted Noboru Taki, who suggested she could play a different instrument, however, Tomoe decided it was too close to auditions to try learning a new instrument. She later announced to the band that she would be stepping down from participation in the auditions, and instead would support them as concert band manager.Relationships.Yuuko Yoshikawa.Tomoe is a friend of Yuuko where they sometimes hang out together when Yuuko is not with Kaori Nakaseko, Natsuki Nakagawa or Mizore Yoroizuka.

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3254","text":"Trombone is a musical instrument in the family. A musician who plays the trombone is called a \"trombonist\" or simply a \"trombone player\".Construction.The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the baritone horn, and in contrast to its conical valved counterparts, the euphonium and the horn.It has a very distinct shape, featuring a long, primarily cylindrical tube made of brass which is narrowest at the mouthpiece's end and widest at the bell. Its most defining characteristic is its slide, which can be used to adjust the length of the tubing and thus the pitch of the instrument.Variants.The term \"trombone\" generally refers to the standard B\u266d tenor trombone, rather than the whole family or any of its other members.Bass Trombone.The \"bass trombone\" is a common variant of the regular tenor trombone. It is pitched in B\u266d, and has a wider bore, giving it a boost in the lower register. Additionally, it has two triggers which alter the key of the instrument, the first changing it to F, and the second either E, G\u266d, or D depending on which system is in place on the instrument.Alto Trombone.The \"alto trombone\" is a once common instrument pitched in E\u266d or F, a fourth or fifth higher than the tenor trombone. It is one of two instruments to read regularly in alto clef, the other being viola. Recently, the alto trombone has risen in popularity as new repertoire is being written and discovered.Soprano\/Piccolo Trombone.The \"soprano\" and \"piccolo\" trombones are exceedingly rare instruments. The soprano trombone is pitched in B\u266d, and is often mistaken as a slide trumpet, which is a completely separate instrument. The piccolo trombone is even rarer, and was historically used as the highest voice in trombone choirs. They are primarily played by trumpeters.Contrabass Trombone.The \"contrabass trombone\" is an uncommon member of the trombone family. It is usually pitched in either B\u266d of F. It is sometimes seen in orchestral literature.Cimbasso.The \"cimbasso\" (pronounced chim-BAH-so) is a type of contrabass trombone. It features 3-6 rotary or piston valves, and is usually pitched in F like the contrabass trombone, though C, E\u266d and B\u266d models exist too. It has the same range as a tuba, and is considered a hybrid between it and the trombone. It is most often found in opera pieces.Valve Trombone.The \"valve trombone\" contains a wide variety of ranges, from alto to contrabass, but the most common is the tenor valve trombone. They are played identically to trumpets, but an octave lower.Performance.Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike other brass instruments that use valves, the trombone mostly uses a unique slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch, Due to this mechanism, it is often difficult to play quick rhythms. However, it also allows for the characteristic glissandi the instrument can produce.Trombones have one of the widest dynamic ranges, from incredibly quiet to outrageously loud, actually being the loudest wind instrument aside from pipe organs. It can also use a mute similar to trumpets, however, it doesn't affect the sound in quite the same way.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There are six students that play trombone in Kitauji High School Concert Band, which are: Hideri Noguchi - 1st trombone, trombone section leader Maki Akamatsu - 1st trombone Mei Taura - 2nd trombone Shuuichi Tsukamoto - 2nd trombone\/Trombone section leader, vice president (Sound!

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3301","text":"Trumpet is a musical instrument in the family. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a \"trumpeter\" or simply a \"trumpet player\".Construction.The most common type of trumpet is a transposing instrument pitched in B\u266d with a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of cylindrical brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded oblong shape.The early precursors to the trumpet \u2013 the cornetto and the natural trumpet\u2014did not have valves or keys, but modern instruments generally have either three or four piston valves or, less commonly, three or four rotary valves. Each valve increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. Additionally, trumpets use tuning slides which can be extended or shortened to adjust the pitch and overall tuning of the instrument.Modern trumpets are made from brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, but the earliest trumpets were made out of many different materials, including conch shells and wood.Variants.The term trumpet generally refers to the B\u266d trumpet, rather than the whole family or any of its other members.C and G Trumpets.While trumpets exist in many keys, C and G are some of the most common.The \"C trumpet\" is the most common type of trumpet other than the B\u266d trumpet. It is used primarily in orchestral settings. Construction and performance-wise, it has no major differences when compared to the B\u266d trumpet.The \"G trumpet \"drum corps, where it replaces trumpets. They are also called \"sopranos\" or \"soprano bugles\".There is also the D\/E\u266d trumpet, which can play in two different keys with the adjustments of tuning slides.Piccolo Trumpet.The \"piccolo trumpet\" is a subfamily of instruments which are pitched one octave higher than a standard soprano trumpet, usually in the key of either B\u266d or A. They are incredibly difficult to play, and fill in the highest register of the brass section.Cornet.Though technically not part of the trumpet family, the \"cornet\" functions very similarly. Its main physical difference is its conical bore, which allows for a mellower and warmer tone. It is common in British Brass Bands where it is played instead of the trumpet. It finds a spot in many orchestras, concert bands, jazz bands, marching bands, and military bands.Flugelhorn.While technically a member of the tuba family, the \"flugelhorn\" is usually played by trumpet players when called for. It is essentially a valved bugle. It is a regular member of jazz and brass bands, and occasionally is called for in concert bands, orchestras, and marching bands.Bass Trumpet.The \"bass trumpet\" is an uncommon member of the trumpet family. It is very similar to the valve trombone in all respects, except with a brighter tone. As such, it is usually played by a trombonist when called for, rather than a trumpeter.Performance.The trumpet is played by blowing air through almost-closed lips, producing a \"buzzing\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Playing in the higher register is very difficult for most players due to the extreme embouchure required, as with all brass instruments.Trumpets can also use mutes to modify the sound of the instrument, as well as decrease the volume.Scoring.Trumpets are found in concert bands, symphony orchestras, jazz bands, marching bands, and military bands. They are also commonly used as solo instruments in popular and rock music.The trumpet has the highest register out of all brass instruments. Many wind band compositions call for both a trumpet section and a cornet section. This type of scoring requires solo playing skills, particularly if the number of trumpet players in the ensemble is rather small.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There are seven students that play trumpet in Kitauji High School Concert Band, including: Kaori Nakaseko - 1st trumpet, trumpet section leader, band accountant Reina Kousaka - 1st trumpet, \"Crescent Moon Dance\" soloist, instrument manager\/Trumpet section leader, drum major (Sound!

A person who plays the tuba is known as a tubaist or tubist.Variants.The tuba comes in two forms of valves:Piston ValvesRotary Valves - This tuba is what Kitauji's band members use, with the exception of Mirei Suzuki.Tubas can be pitched in a variety of keys, but the four most common types of keys are B\u266d, C, E\u266d, and F. The tubas in B\u266d amd C are commonly referred to as \"contrabass tubas\", while the instruments in E\u266d and F are likewise referred to as \"bass tubas\".Sousaphone.The sousaphone is an instrument similar to a tuba designed to make holding it easier. It is most commonly used in marching bands. It wraps around the player's waist, making it easier to carry while marching. It typically has three piston valves, but there are also models with four valves to increase range.Contrabass Bugle.The contrabass bugle, pitched in the key of G and much like the sousaphone, is also an instrument similar to a tuba designed to make playing and holding it easier. It replaces the sousaphone in drum &amp; bugle corps, along with some marching bands. It rests on the shoulder of the player while being played and is held in front or by the side when at horns down position.

A musician who plays chimes is called a \"chimes player\", or more broadly and frequently a \"mallet percussionist\".Construction.The instrument is unique compared to other mallet percussion instruments. Rather than consisting of bars arranged horizontally, it uses a series of bells suspended vertically across a frame, still organized like a piano keyboard. Each bell is a tube 30\u201338 mm (1 1\u20444\u20131 1\u20442\") in diameter, varying in length to determine the pitch, with longer tubes producing lower notes and shorter producing higher.Tubular bells may have a sustain pedal attached to allow extended ringing of the bells. The instrument's frame with either have wheels, or the instrument will be mounted on a stand of some description with wheels, to aid mobility.Performance.Chimes are played by striking the bells with one or two wooden mallets, which are larger and more hammer-shaped than other percussion mallets. Thus, a player can never have more than one in a hand at a time. Due to these limitations, chimes usually don't see as much melody as other mallet percussion instruments. Instead, the instrument is mostly used for accents and colour in music, and are required to stand out. A common joke among percussionists is that the chimes can never be loud enough.Scoring.Tubular bells are primarily used in concert bands and symphony orchestras. They may also be used in pop, rock, or other genres of music occasionally as decoration instruments.The instrument was initially designed to replicate the sound of church bells or carillons, and this is still apparent in most of its repertoire. Some pieces feature short solos for the instrument, often depicting such.Saki Kayama plays tubular bells in Crescent Moon Dance.Sousuke Maeda plays tubular bells in Liz and the Blue Bird's fourth movement."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=7856","text":"Vibraphone, colloquially known as vibes is a musical instrument in the percussion family. A musician who plays the vibraphone is called a \"vibraphonist\" or simply a \"vibraphone player\".Construction.The instrument consists of a set of aluminum bars arranged like a . The bars are arched underneath to lower the pitch and thus make the lower notes more manageably sized. The bars are suspended by a cord that runs through the width of the bars through a hole drilled through the node of the bar (the least resonant part of the bar). Beneath each bar is a resonator, a thin-walled tube that helps amplify the instrument's sound. The length of the tube is determined by the size of the bar, and both must be perfectly in tune with each other.Vibraphones are the most mechanically complex mallet percussion instrument. They have a pedal that can be used to dampen the sound (shorten the length of the notes) if it is left untouched, or allow the notes to be sustained if it is pressed down. This is not unlike the piano's pedal. The instrument also has a motor that can be turned on and off to rotate the disks inside the resonators. The speed can also be adjusted, and when turned on, it produces a vibrato effect.Typically built with 3 octaves, in the past decade, a surge of new 4-octave vibraphones has arisen. This has increased the versatility of the instrument greatly.Performance.Vibraphones are famous for their extremely versatile usage, especially as a percussion instrument. It requires all the same techniques as another mallet percussion instrument, such as holding mallets properly or selecting the proper type of mallet (which is usually yarn). Additionally, vibraphones have a number more techniques than just about any other percussion instrument.Due to the unique construction of the instrument, it allows composers creativity in the sustain effect. Players need good coordination in both their hands and feet if there is extensive use of the pedal. Since all the notes struck remain sustained, it can often result in a very dissonant sound by the end of the passage. In order to mitigate this, vibraphonists may use a technique known as \"mallet dampening\", in which they gently rub one of their mallets against the last played note as they strike the next. This eliminates the need for the rather jarring stop produced by lifting the pedal.Vibraphone parts often call for unconventional ways to produce sound. One of the more popular is by scraping an orchestral bow (usually cello) along the edge of the bars. Scoring.Vibraphones are used in concert bands, symphony orchestras, jazz bands, and marching bands. In concert bands and wind ensembles, vibraphone parts are usually written as a portion of a greater Percussion 1, 2, 3, etc. part. In marching bands, vibraphones are commonly members of the front ensemble.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".In Kitauji High School Concert Band, Sousuke Maeda plays a vibraphone in movements 3 and 4 of Liz and the Blue Bird piece."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=7099","text":"Xylophone is a musical instrument in the percussion family. A person who plays the xylophone is called a \"xylophonist\" or simply a \"xylophone player\".Construction.The xylophone consists of a set of wooden bars arranged like a piano keyboard. Each bar is tuned to a pitch of the chromatic scale, with longer bars being lower-pitched and shorter bars being higher pitched. Bars on the xylophone are also much thicker and narrower than a marimba, which creates the distinction between the two instruments. Xylophones also feature a series of resonators beneath the bars which helps project their sound. Usually, the xylophone has a range of 3 &amp; 1\/2 to 4 octavesVariants.Xylorimba.The \"xylorimba\", \"xylomarimba\" or \"marimba-xylophone\" is a variant of the xylophone with an extended lower range (usually extending the range to 5 octaves total). Though often confused as a fusion of the marimba and the xylophone, this is not the case. The xylorimba's lower register is described as sounding much more similar to a xylophone than a marimba, due to the construction of the instrument's bars and resonators.Its name, and the instrument as a whole, is a source of confusion, even among professional composers and musicians. Sometimes composers will write pieces for the instrument that can be played on a regular xylophone, perhaps because they assumed based on the name that the instrument's tone is a combination between the marimba and xylophone without actually researching it.Performance.To further distinguish the xylophone from the marimba, xylophones use relatively hard acrylic mallets, as opposed to yarn mallets. This results in the much sharper, brighter, and accented tone that the instrument is famous for.Players must be familiar with how to hold mallets and perform a variety of techniques using them, including tremolo and glissandi. Xylophone parts often call for difficult runs and passages, so players are required to be quite dexterous. The xylophonist also frequently must use more than two mallets, up to four, which can prove challenging.Scoring.Despite being in the key of C, the xylophone is a transposing instrument as it reads its music an octave below how it sounds.Xylophones are used in concert bands, symphony orchestras, and marching bands. In concert bands and wind ensembles, xylophone parts are usually written as a portion of a greater Percussion 1, 2, 3, etc. part. As for marching bands, xylophones can either be a part of the front ensemble, or be carried as a marching xylophone, which is much smaller than a regular concert xylophone for logical reasons.Saki Kayama played xylophone in \"Crescent Moon Dance\", March \"Wind of Provence\", and \"Takarajima\".Miyoko Oono played marching xylophone at the Sunrise Festival.Contrary to popular belief, the small, often colourful toys consisting of metal bars are not, in fact, xylophones, though they are often called such. These are unspecified, usually pitched to a diatonic scale, and poorly, if at all, tuned.This myth is especially ironic as the prefix \"Xylo\" means \"wood\", while these toys are made of metal."}

Yuuko does acknowledge these flaws of hers and tries to improve herself, and gets over her own pride for the success of the band.By nature, Yuuko will put great importance in the people she cares about, willing to do anything she can to ensure their happiness and well-being. Sometimes, this leads her to make some mistakes, but other times it elicits very noble actions from her. Conversely, Yuuko behaves acerbically towards individuals she dislikes or someone she perceives as a threat to her cherished friends.Chronology.Season 1.Episodes 2-4.Yuuko is introduced as a second-year trumpet player who shows a great amount of admiration for Kaori Nakaseko (Yuuko's section senior), as she pounces on every possible opportunity to walk home with Kaori. Also, Yuuko is shown to dislike Reina Kousaka from as early on as when Reina plays her trumpet for the first time, probably due to the fact that Reina can play better than Kaori.Episode 5.At the Sunrise Festival, Yuuko (along with most of the band members) feels nervous after she witnesses Rikka High School's performance. Kaori Nakaseko sees this and tells her to take a deep breath. When Reina suddenly blows her trumpet as an attempt to calm everyone down, Yuuko tells Reina that they are not allowed to make noise while waiting for their turn. Reina apologizes and brushes her hair in response. When Kitauji High School Concert Band's turn comes, Yuuko and other band members perform what they have been practicing, and manage to surprise the spectators.Episode 7.Everyone is preparing for the upcoming audition to select members for the competition team; one day, after the practice ends, Yuuko asks Kaori Nakaseko to go home with her, but before Kaori can answer they hear Reina Kousaka play the trumpet solo part of \"Crescent Moon Dance\". Yuuko talks to Kaori about why Reina would practice that part when the band already has Kaori for the solo, but Kaori tells her that it's okay, since there is no rule that prevents the first-years from practicing that part, and asks Yuuko whether she has been bullying Reina. Yuuko denies it, and tells Reina to clean up since practice is over. Later, Yuuko is shown to have a little fight with Natsuki Nakagawa on her way out of the room. Seeing this, Riko explains to Kumiko Oumae that Natsuki and Yuuko don't really get along.Episode 8.On the festival day, when the practice ends, Yuuko tries to invite Mizore Yoroizuka to go to the festival with her, but Mizore declines her offer, so Yuuko ends up going to the festival with Natsuki Nakagawa and Tomoe Kabe instead.Episode 9.Yuuko passes the audition, but is shocked to learn that Reina Kousaka will get to play the solo part instead of the crowd favorite Kaori Nakaseko.Episode 10.Yuuko hears the rumor about Noboru Taki knowing Reina Kousaka long before she enrolled at Kitauji High School Concert Band. It means that Taki-sensei might be biased toward Reina, which would explain why Kaori Nakaseko doesn't get to play the solo part. Even though Kaori asks Yuuko to tell the others not to spread that rumor, Yuuko decides to ask Taki-sensei about it in front of all the band members. Taki-sensei tells her that he evaluates everyone without prejudice, but also confesses that he has known Reina since middle school, as their fathers are acquainted.When Yuuko tries to ask something more, Reina interrupts their conversation and tells Yuuko to stop insulting Taki-sensei. Reina says that she was selected because she plays better than Kaori. Reina's words greatly enrage Yuuko, leading her to yell at Reina. Kaori manages to stop the fight before things get worse.Yuuko's actions cause an uneasy atmosphere in the band in the following days, and everyone starts to lose their motivation for the competition. Taki-sensei decides to resolve this problem by presenting all the band members a chance for a re-audition. Kaori grabs this chance and asks for re-audition.Episode 11.Yuuko eavesdrops on Reina Kousaka's play. When Yuuko sees Kumiko Oumae going to invite Reina out for lunch, she asks Kumiko's opinion on Reina's play. Kumiko says that Reina sounds very good and deserves to play the solo. Yuuko agrees with Kumiko, and says that it's unfair that a first-year can play that good, before walking away.Later, Natsuki Nakagawa warns Yuuko against doing \"something stupid\", else this situation will only hurt Kaori Nakaseko, which makes Yuuko fall deeper into sadness.Then, Yuuko confronts Reina, bowing before her and asking her to purposely drop the audition. Yuuko explains that in the previous years Kaori didn't get to play a solo part because of the seniority system, and this year will be Kaori's last chance to do it. She also tells Reina that Kaori tried to resign from the competition in order to stop the first-year members from quitting the band last year. However, Reina says that it has nothing to do with her, and walks away.On the day of re-audition, after Kaori and Reina finish their performance, and the band starts voting, it turns out that only Yuuko and Haruka Ogasawara clap for Kaori, while only Kumiko and Hazuki Katou clap for Reina. Taki-sensei then asks Kaori whether she will play the solo part. Kaori, knowing that Reina plays better than her, declines his offer and says that Reina should be the one to play it. Upon hearing this, Yuuko finally breaks down and cries out loud.Episode 12.On the morning of one day, Yuuko and Kaori Nakaseko greet Reina Kousaka, who apologizes for her behavior during the audition, and Kaori apologizes to Reina in turn.

Later, she learns from Natsuki that Nozomi is also at the pool.Episode 3.Yuuko catches Kumiko Oumae eavesdropping on her conversation with Natsuki Nakagawa, and invites Kumiko for a chat with her.

Her favorite colors are yellow and pink. Yuuko resembles Ai Shindou from the \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" series, which is also animated by Kyoto Animation. They also share the same voice actress. Yuuko, Natsuki Nakagawa, Nozomi Kasaki and Mizore Yoroizuka graduated from Minami Junior High School. Yuuko's height is actually at average compared to other characters in the anime. The reason she looks small is that she is often seen standing next to Kaori Nakaseko who is quite tall. Yuuko was one of the hardworking band members who didn't quit the band last year. Character Designer Shouko Ikeda said in an interview that she specifically designed Yuuko to look very cute. Yuuko's trumpet model is the Yamaha YTR-850S."}

Yuuko often asks Kaori if she wants to go home together, and she holds her in high regard. She will get hostile and angry if someone hurts her in any way.  The reason Yuuko admires Kaori so much is because Kaori was the person who supported and encouraged her to stay in the band during Kitauji High School Concert Band Schism last year.Kaori also likes Yuuko as an underclassmen but does not show it like Yuuko.

It contains songs such as \"Dixie\", \"Yankee Doodle\" and \"Columbia, gem of the ocean\". It is to be noted that the 1885 and 1914 piano copies of the piece do not contain the song \"Dixie\".The format of this song, as well as other Patrol pieces, is to represent a military band marching down a street. For example, it usually starts with a dynamic such as piano or pianissimo, grows louder as the peice progresses, until eventually a recapitulation of the theme plays again and the music fades out to a paino, pianissimo, or even quiter as the band \"walks\" away.Notable Preformances.This piece has been played in many small or not well known bands over the years but the most notable include Glen Millers band, Halle's band, a Marine band and many others.The first major band to preform this song was on July 2, 1892 was the Marine Band, in Portland Oregon. It was followed up in 1893 by Clauder's Exposition band. It was then preformed again at the 1893 annual meeting of the American Street-Railway Association. It was also preformed in 1893 at Conterno's band and orchestras concert in Paradise Park. It was also preformed in 1896 for a fourth of July celebration by Halle's concert band in Winthrop Park, as well as on the television show Gilligan's Island in episode 6, \"Music hath charm\"The most famous performance of this piece was with Glenn Millers Band. It was originally recorded on April 2, 1942 while he and his band were filming the musical film \"Orchestra Wives\".

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2193","text":"Asuka Tanaka is the recurring character of \"Sound! Euphonium\" series. Asuka is the daughter of Masakazu Shindou and Akemi Tanaka. She is a third-year student of Kitauji High School, the school band's vice president and bass section leader. Asuka plays an euphonium alongside Kumiko Oumae.Appearance.Asuka is a teenage girl of above-average height with straight and lush shoulder-length black hair, and light-blue eyes; she wears thin red circular glasses, which are seen as her trademark.According to many other characters (including Hazuki Katou), she is regarded as beautiful.Personality.Outwardly, Asuka has a highly playful personality who is also very friendly and caring that her constant high energy often comes off as extremely childish to the other band members.However, her humor and lighthearted appearance is merely a cover for a range of deeper emotions that Asuka struggles with and has repressed over many years, some of which stem from her mother's extreme parenting, and from having all contact with her father cut off by her mother. Her bright outer self is also a facade her for true personality, which is much more sly, calculating, and coldly logical. When necessary, Asuka can be extremely pragmatic and manipulative, and is a little self-centered. However, despite being colder than she looks, she isn't a bad person by any means.Asuka demonstrates the ability to handle a large amount of responsibility and was actually favored by many band members to be the band's president. She, however, declined. Asuka has shown a marked disinterest in the social dynamics of the band over the years that she has participated in it, and even an indifferent attitude to the skill level of the group as a whole. This is because her main goal in participation is to create time to advance herself as a musician, and most importantly, as a euphonium player. She considers handling ensemble drama issues to be a waste of her time because it deviates from her main objective of personal musical improvement.Asides from practicing technical skills, Asuka also spends a large amount of her free time researching music theory, the history of her own instrument, and the background of the pieces that the band is playing. She demonstrates awareness of composer intentions through her passionate monologues and expressive playing. On top of all this, she manages to maintain excellent grades in school.Asuka does not care about the competitive glory of the band, nor whether or not the band around her sounds good or bad. As long as she continues to have a space in which she can practice, and have an allotted amount of time each day to play her euphonium, she will be content with where she is.Background.Prior to the beginning of the series, Asuka, as a young child, was mailed a silver euphonium and several music books from her father, whom her mother divorced. With the help of her younger brother, Asuka quickly became a very talented euphonist.Chronology.Asuka first appears when Hazuki Katou, Kumiko Oumae and Sapphire Kawashima enter the band room for the first time, where they see many students and Asuka herself playing music. After chatting a little, Asuka approaches them and surprises Hazuki with a kissing face, making Hazuki trip and fall in shock. Then, Asuka opens the door and asks if they are coming to visit. After Asuka introduces herself properly, Hazuki decides that Asuka is very beautiful.During the first level of competition, Asuka appears downcast onstage and post-performance due to her knowing that her mother will not allow her to compete in the nationals, unknown to her peers.In the first time half of the second season and in the second light novel, Asuka learns that her father, whom she has not seen since she was very young, will be judging the final round of the competition. Now that she has the determination from her father to continue striving to perform, Asuka begins to behave in extreme ways. The most notable instance of this is when she tries strongly to forbid Nozomi Kasaki from rejoining the band, fearing that the sour relationship between Nozomi and Mizore Yoroizuka, a player in the band's musical success, will affect Mizore's performance ability.In the second half of the second season and in the third light novel, Asuka is forced by her mother to quit the band but eventually manages to return in time for the final competition, at which she receives the first contact from her father in many years. The name Asuka is written in hiragana (\u3042\u3059\u304b), which has no special meaning. However, when written in kanji (\u660e\u65e5\u9999 or \u98db\u9ce5), it could possibly mean:\u660e\u65e5\u9999 - \"tomorrow\" (\u660e\u65e5) (asu) and \"fragrance, fragrant\" (\u9999) (ka).\u98db\u9ce5 - \"to fly\" (\u98db) (asu) and \"bird, poultry, fowl\" (\u9ce5) (ka).Asuka's surname Tanaka means \"field, rice paddy\" (\u7530) (ta) and \"middle\" (\u4e2d) (naka), which literally means \"dweller in the rice fields\" altogether. Even though Asuka has the same surname as Sugami Tanaka, they both have no familial relation with each other. Asuka's hobbies are reading and going to the aquarium. Asuka's euphonium is based on a Yamaha YEP-621S model."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=4947","text":"Asuka Tanaka\/RelationshipsStudents.Kumiko Oumae.Asuka is Kumiko's section leader and senpai, and is the one who discovers that Kumiko is a proficient euphonium player and ropes her into joining the bass section. In the first light novel, Asuka is very aware of her senpai status to Kumiko and thus always employs great discretion about her personal feelings when speaking to Kumiko. As the story progresses over the light novels, Asuka grows to care for Kumiko, and eventually invites Kumiko to her house and shares the story of her father with her. On the day of Asuka's graduation, she gives a book of euphonium pieces composed by her father to Kumiko, saying that Kumiko have better use for it now than she will post-graduation.Natsuki Nakagawa.Natsuki always addresses Asuka in an overly respectful way that at first appears to be sarcastic, but is later shown to be sincere and heartfelt beneath the humor. Natsuki and Asuka's dynamic is greatly similar to the relationship between Kumiko Oumae and Reina Kousaka, in that Asuka's passion and drive inspires Natsuki to work harder than she thought she ever could.When Asuka is forced to quit the band before the final level of competition, she appoints Natsuki as her successor, telling her that it is her turn to lead. Natsuki, however, firmly declines and informs Asuka resolutely that she and the section will wait faithfully for Asuka's return.Haruka Ogasawara.Asuka and Haruka share a good relationship as respectively the vice president and president of the band. Asuka is often able to help Haruka when the latter's low self-esteem becomes a problem.Despite this, Haruka always struggles with the feeling that she was only elected as the band president because Asuka turned it down, and she always feels second to Asuka. In addition, she also feels slightly resentful that Asuka pushed the burden of being the president of a mediocre ensemble on her. However, Haruka's good nature allows her to maintain a friendship with Asuka above the politics of the band.Teachers.Noboru Taki.Taki respects Asuka as a musician and senior student, and Asuka is on board with his driven methods, especially after she switches her mindset in the second light novel from personal improvement to focusing on nationals.In the third light novel, Asuka's mother forces Asuka to meet with her and Taki in Taki's office. Asuka's mother demands that Taki allow Asuka to quit the band, but Taki sees the downcast expression Asuka wears and tells Asuka's mother that he will not do anything that is against his students' wills. Furious, Asuka's mother drags Asuka out into the hallway and tries to force her to ask Taki on her own to quit. Realizing that Taki will not let her be removed from the band as long as she does not ask personally, Asuka refuses. Her mother slaps her so hard that she falls to the floor.When the vice principal decides to accept Asuka's resignation letter on Taki's behalf, Taki does not find out until Yuuko informs him. He leaves rehearsal quickly and attempts to stop the letter from being processed, but he is too late.Though she does miss a few days of school, Asuka eventually returns to the band for the competition.Family.Masakazu Shindou.Asuka's father, Masakazu Shindou, is one of the best euphonium players in the world, and is also a respected figure in the concert band world. The silver euphonium that Asuka plays belonged to him. That instrument, along with a book of euphonium music\" \"composed by her father, are the only two reminders of her father that Asuka possesses, because her mother completely cut off all contact with Masakazu since they divorced when Asuka was very young.Asuka has always felt her father's musical talent within her, and naturally took to playing the euphonium. Her mother opposed Asuka's love for music her whole life, but tolerated it as long as Asuka kept up her perfect grades, and as long as Asuka never played in a band that would attend the national band competition, which Asuka later finds out that Masakazu is known to judge at.When Asuka and the Kitauji Concert Band do make it to the nationals, Masakazu gives the band the lowest rating possible, but adds a personal note on the scoring sheet that the principal euphonium player is very talented. Noboru Taki relays the message to Asuka, unaware that Masakazu is Asuka's father, and Asuka smiles when she hears this. It is described in the light novels that this is the first genuine smile she has worn in a long time."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=7136","text":"Auxiliary Percussion, also called ancillary percussion, toys, or sound effects are a group of instruments in the percussion family. Technically speaking, they include any instrument that is not pitched, though some instances, notably drums (like the snare drum, bass drum), or cymbals, are counted separately by most standards. They are small, usually handheld objects that produce sound by being struck, shaken, or scraped. In some cases, they are also blown into. These instruments are not standard in most ensembles, and, as the name suggests, they are used to add certain effects to music. Almost all auxiliary percussion instruments are unpitched, with a few exceptions being partially pitched.Instruments.The following list is not exhaustive.Triangle.The triangle is one of the most famous auxiliary percussion instruments. It is a small, triangular instrument made of a thin rod of metal. It is played with a short stick, usually metal, being hit either on one of the sides of the instrument or in the corner if it is being repeatedly struck in quick succession. The player holds the instrument by a small loop of thread or wire at one of the corners, or it may be suspended. Players can hold the triangle's body to shorten the length of a note.Tambourine.The tambourine is an instrument popular is nearly every genre of music. It is a small frame made of either wood or plastic, typically circular but sometimes other shapes, with several pairs of small metal jingles called zills. Tambourines sometimes have a drumhead made of skin stretched across one face of the frame, adding extra versatility to the instrument. Players can shake the instrument or strike it with either their hand or a stick to produce noise. Experienced players can drag either their thumb or their middle finger over the drumhead to produce a rolling effect.Shaker.The shaker is a simple instrument that can come in many shapes and sizes. The general shaker consists of a container of some sort, with small, usually round objects inside, particularly beads or seeds. Shakers can be cylindrical, like the rainstick, egg-shaped or round, or have handles such as maracas. Shakers are used to provide extra rhythm in many ensembles, especially rock music.Agogo.The agogo is an instrument that consists of two bells of differing sizes and pitches, connected by a U-shaped metal rod which the player holds. The player strikes the instrument with a drumstick. Its sound is very similar to a cowbell, and is often mistaken as such. It is very popular in samba and African music.Whistle.Although technically aerophones, whistles, when called for in ensembles, are typically played by percussionists if they are for auxiliary purposes. Whistles come in many varieties, including bird whistles, slide whistles, or samba whistles. These instruments can be pitched, but not usually playable in the same sense as a wind instrument like the flute.Gong\/Tam-tam.The gong, and its sibling the tam-tam, are loud, circular plates of metal usually hung from a frame. The difference between the two is that tam-tams are plane, while gongs are bossed. This produces two distinct sounds; tam-tams, more common in the west, have a sound like a large crash cymbal. Meanwhile, gongs produce a tuned note. The instruments are played in much the same way, with one or two usually soft mallets, and can be used for a wide variety of effects.RatchetWhip\/SlapstickCowbellSleigh BellsClavesGuiroSirenWind MachineVibraslapMark TreeBell TreeCabasaWoodblockTemple BlockThunder SheetBrake DrumAnvilCastanetsAs portrayed in \"Sound!

Euphonium\" series and she is also the main character of the Rikka High School spin-off novels, which tell the story from Rikka High School's perspective. Appearance.Azusa is a fair-skinned girl with straight mid-length blackish hair that is tied up into a ponytail at the back and bright light-indigo eyes. Azusa is usually seen wearing a standard Rikka High School marching uniform for female students.Personality.Not so much known about Azusa's personality except that she is a very friendly person who cares for her friends and she loves playing instruments, likes music that she is passionate about, but she also knows when to be serious and not where she is quite mature and understanding of situations.Chronology.Azusa is first introduced in Welcome! High School, sitting beside Kumiko Oumae as they await the competition results. She then leaves to tell another band member the results, enabling Kumiko's fateful exchange of words with Reina Kousaka. She next appears in Festival Time, where she performs at SunFes with her school, \"Rikka High School\". There, she again meets Kumiko and they talked a little. Azusa asked Kumiko why she chose Kitauji High School, but Kumiko said that she didn't have a reason, but rather that she wanted to have a new start. After that, she went away to perform with her school, while Azusa did the same. She later appeared in Goodbye Competition, briefly waving to Kumiko, and was later shown looking nervous during Kitauji's performance. In the movie-version retelling of the first season, Azusa gets a few images focused on her during the credits, after the competition. The name Azusa means \"Japanese Cherry Birch\" (\u6893).  It is among other senses (other trees and objects made from this wood).  Azusa's surname Sasaki means \"help, aid\" (\u4f50) (sa) and \"tree, wood\" (\u6728) (ki).  According to the official \"Sound! Euphonium\" novel website:Azusa's favorite color is light blue (the same as the Rikka uniform).Azusa's hobbies are playing the trombone and going bowling, since she often went with her mother when she was younger.Azusa's special skills are playing the trombone and having a keen sense of editing photos from purikura (photo booth) machines.Azusa likes potato chips, roasted sweet potatoes, baked potatoes with butter and practicing.Azusa dislikes holidays with no plans. Azusa has the same given name as her voice actress, Azusa Tadokoro. Azusa, along with fellow former Daikichiyama Kita Middle School band members Reina Kousaka and Shuuichi Tsukamoto, are the only people from before Kumiko's (intended) fresh start at Kitauji High School that Kumiko is known to still be in contact with. To further expand the above point, Kumiko's negative situations with both Reina and Shuuichi at the time were two major reasons Kumiko wanted a fresh start in the first place, making Azusa the only person Kumiko was still in contact with and also not trying to avoid."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3266","text":"Baritone Saxophone or \"Bari Sax\" (commonly abbreviated \"BS\", or \"Bars\") is a member of the saxophone family. A musician who plays the baritone saxophone is called a \"baritone saxophonist\" or simply a \"baritone sax player\".Construction.Being the lowest-pitched saxophone in common use, the bari sax is also the largest. Similar to other saxophones, it features a long conical tube which bends at the bottom 180\u00b0 to curve upwards and flares into the bell. At the other end, the tube loops around in an oval shape, which then connects to the neck piece, and further the mouthpiece. Bari saxes are usually made out of brass, and weight 10-15 pounds.As it is a woodwind, it uses a reed, which is attached to the mouthpiece using a ligature made of either metal or fabric. It's reed is the largest of all woodwinds, being about as wide as but much longer than a bass clarinet reed.A neck strap is attached to the instrument to aid in supporting its weight. On some models, like Haruka's, a kickstand is attached to rest in the instrument on the floor.Variants.Bari saxes have only ever been produced in the key of E\u266d. However, some newer models have an extension which allows the instrument to go a semitone lower to A (concert C), where normally it can only reach B\u266d (concert D\u266d). Low A bari saxes are necessarily larger and heavier.Performance.Due to the size of the instrument, bari saxes need much more air than your standard alto or tenor sax. Low register notes can be difficult for new players to reach, as they require a lot of breath support and a different embouchure. On the contrary, playing in the high register is often much easier, and bari sax is the easiest saxophone to play the altissimo range (extended high range).Additionally, due to the weight of the instrument, many smaller or weaker players find it difficult to play the instrument for an extended period of time due to the strain on their neck and back. This is especially true for marching bands.The instrument has a very distinct, dark tone, which often makes it difficult to blend into other instruments in an ensemble. Bari sax players often have to adjust their tone according to the piece they are playing or the ensemble they are a part of. For example, the tone required for a concert band piece written as \"dolce\" is much different than a jazz piece, which oftentimes expects the bari sax to stand out as a solo instrument.Scoring.Bari saxes are most popular in jazz bands, concert bands, and marching bands. Bari saxes are often featured as a background instrument in popular music. They are infrequently used in classical music or symphony orchestras.As they are so large, expensive, and comparatively difficult, most beginner musicians do not start on baritone sax. Instead, after a few years, an alto sax or tenor sax player will switch to play bari sax. Many smaller bands do not feature a baritone saxophonist, but the standard amount is 1\u20133.As portrayed in \"Hibike! Euphonium\".Haruka Ogasawara, the band president and saxophone section leader, is the only student who primarily plays baritone saxophone in the Kitauji High School Concert Band for the main anime series. However, Chikai Maki, who primarily plays alto saxophone, has been seen playing baritone saxophone in certain performances, such as in \"Takarajima\" and \"Gakuen Tengoku\".In \"\", two more baritone sax players join the ensemble: Kyouko Ayukawa Tadashi Endou Haruka Ogasawara's saxophone seen in \"Sound! Euphonium\" is based on Yamaha YBS-62 model."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3950","text":"Bass Clarinet is a musical instrument of the . Someone who plays the bass clarinet is called a \"bass clarinetist\".Variants.Like the more common soprano B\u266d clarinet, it is usually pitched in B\u266d, meaning it is a transposing instrument on which a written C sounds as B\u266d, but plays notes an octave below the soprano B\u266d Clarinet.Bass clarinets have also existed in other keys, notably C and A, but are very rare (in contrast to the regular A clarinet, which is quite common in classical music). Most average bass clarinets can play down to a low Eb, while some may have an extension, allowing them to play to a very low C. These are often called low C bass clarinets and are more common amongst professional players. Bass clarinets regularly perform in orchestras, wind ensembles\/concert bands, occasionally in marching bands, and play an occasional solo role in contemporary music and jazz in particular.There is an even lower-pitched clarinet called the contrabass clarinet, and a slightly higher-pitched clarinet (but lower-pitched than a B\u266d soprano) called the alto clarinet.Performance.The bass clarinet is played in a similar fashion to the B\u266d clarinet, by blowing into a mouthpiece with a single reed attached. The musician opens or closes keys to change the pitch of the instrument.It should be worth noting that many clarinetists can also play the bass clarinet. The player will read in treble clef for both clarinet and bass clarinet, since they are both B\u266d transposing instruments.Scoring.Bass clarinet parts are typically not divided into first, second, or third parts, unlike B\u266d clarinets.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There are two bass clarinet players in the Kitauji Concert Band: Hitoshi Usui - Principal Bass Clarinet Junko KoshikawaIn \"\", a new bass clarinet player joins the ensemble, and a current member switches: Ayako Sakasaki Youko Matsuzaki (Formerly B\u266d Clarinet)In \"Sound!

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6599","text":"Bass Drum also called Kick Drum, is an instrument in the percussion family. It is a large drum which produces a loud, deep, sound with an indeterminate pitch. Someone who plays the bass drum is called a bass drummer, or more broadly, a percussionist.Variants.There are two main types of bass drum: The \"concert bass drum\", and the \"kick drum\".The concert bass drum is the larger of the two, usually mounted on a frame and struck with a mallet. It can be rotated around on this frame to aid the player as necessary. Sometimes the drum is suspended on springs to reduce stress on the frame. The kick drum is much smaller, placed on the floor as a part of drum sets and serving as the mount for toms. It is played with a pedal. The pedal is a small, simple machine that is pushed down on by the foot. This causes a small mallet to extend and strike the drum. Additionally, there exist bass drums which are carried in marching bands, called \"marching bass drums\". They are strapped onto the player's front. In size, they are about the same as a kick drum, and function similarly to a concert bass drum.Performance.Concert Bass Drum.The bass drum is among the simplest percussion instruments. Bass drum rhythms are usually quite simple and typically either play on the beat or follow the melody. Players are expected to strike the drum with proper technique; Generally, you should strike a few inches away from the rim rather than the center of the drum. This produces the fullest sound on the instrument. To further achieve the desired sound, players need to select the proper density and material of the mallet. Additionally, players need to use both hands to play. One hand strikes with the mallet, while the other presses against the drum to mute or dampen the sound. If rolls are also required, the player has to juggle two mallets, and muting becomes more difficult.Kick Drum.Kick drums typically have more difficult parts. As part of the drum kit, they are most prevalent in popular, rock, and jazz music, and are responsible for a great deal of the rhythm. Players must coordinate themselves to play the different rhythms on each drum. In a standard kit, the right foot controls the kick drum pedal. Inside the kick drum is often a blanket, rags, or other variety of cloth. This is used to dampen the sound, since one's hand cannot be used. Techniques like rolls are impossible on this variant, and thus they can't always serve in place of the concert bass drum.Marching Bass Drum.The marching bass drum is near identical in performance to a concert bass drum, but sounds much closer to a kick drum. Mallets are typically not as soft as a concert bass drum, and cannot be switched during a performance in most cases.Scoring.Bass drums, in one variant or another, are included in every type of ensemble, with the exclusion of small groups like chamber music. Concert bass drums are used in wind ensembles, symphony orchestras, and sometimes marching band front ensembles. Kick drums are used in popular music, rock, jazz, wind ensembles in certain cases, or any other group which uses a drum kit. Marching bass drums, as the name suggests, are used exclusively in marching bands or other dynamic ensembles.In wind ensembles and symphony orchestras, bass drums often do not have their own labeled part, and instead will play a \"Percussion\" part which may include other instruments that the bass drummer has to play in addition. As a general rule of percussion instruments, you must be able to play all of them, not a single one; no one is just a bass drummer.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".Every percussionist in the Kitauji High School Concert Band is able to play the bass drum. Some examples include:Masako Sakai played the bass drum in the \"Crescent Moon Dance\" and March \"Wind of Provence\".Miyoko Oono played bass drum in the \"Marines' Hymn\".Saki Kayama played marching bass drum at Sunrise Festival.Narai Tanabe played kick drum as part of a drum kit in \"Gakuen Tengoku\" and \"Takarajima\"."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6611","text":"Bass Guitar also known as Electric Bass, or simply Bass, is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, except with a longer neck and scale length, and four to six strings or courses.Performance.The bass is played quite similarly to a guitar. The neck and fretboard are held in the left hand, and the strings are plucked with the right. Its strings are plucked by either the player's finger and thumb, or a pick. Basses are typically not strummed like the guitar. Its strings are tuned identically to that of the double bass.The bass guitar is normally inaudible when playing in a group, and thus needs to be connected to an amplifier through a patch cord to compete with other instruments.Generally, someone who plays the double bass or guitar can pick up a bass guitar with moderate ease, as many techniques carry over.Scoring.Bass guitars are staple members of jazz and rock bands. Often, their parts are expected to be improvised by the player, rather than having a traditional part. Bass guitars can be found in many modern concert bands, especially for pieces which are arrangements of popular music. The general preference, however, is the double bass. However, in marching band front ensembles, bass guitars are favoured. Bass guitars are rarely, if ever, included in symphony orchestras.As portrayed in \"Hibike!

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3922","text":"Bassoon is an instrument in the . A musician who plays the bassoon is called a \"bassoonist\" or \"bassoon player\".Construction.A bassoon is mostly made out of wood. It is divided into the bell, the bass (long) joint, the tenor (wing) joint, and the boot joint. In additional, there is a silver crook (bocal) containing the instrument's double reed, usually made out of bamboo, which is the part the player blows into.Variants.Contrabassoon.The contrabassoon is the lowest-pitched woodwind instrument in common use. Pitched one octave lower than the bassoon, it is a transposing instrument, with music notated an octave higher than sounding. The instrument is known for its distinct reedy, dark tone, as well as its unique paperclip shape.Contraforte.The \"contraforte\" is a modern variant of the contrabassoon. It has an improved dynamic range and a less harsh tone compared to the regular contrabassoon. The most striking physical difference is its upturned bell, in contrast to the normal downwards bell on contrabassoons. It has gained popularity in recent years, with many new bassoonists preferring to play contraforte over contrabassoon like Lewis Lipnick.Tenoroon.The \"tenoroon\" is essentially a pocket sized bassoon, and, as its name suggests, is the tenor member of the bassoon family, pitched in F, or very rarely, in G However, it is very rare and therefore not called for often in musical literature. Performance.To make a sound on the bassoon, the player blows into the double reed attached to the instrument's bocal. A bassoon typically requires a lot of breath to make it sound good, the same amount of breath that an oboist needs. The player will open and close the silver keys, which will change the pitch of the instrument, as on other woodwind instruments. Bassoons, perhaps infamously, are known for requiring a lot of thumb work in regards to pressing keys. Like oboists, most bassoonists did not start on their own instrument. Just as an oboist usually learns a year or two of clarinet or flute before switching to oboe, a bassoonist has typically played oboe or clarinet for a year or two before switching to bassoon.Scoring.Bassoons are used primarily in concert bands, symphony orchestras, and wind quintets. Like oboes, they are never used in marching bands, for a variety of reasons. Instead, other instruments like saxophones, and historically \"sarrusophones\", fill in their role. Bassoonists will normally become color guard members or double on another instrument during marching season.The bassoon is known for its distinctive tone color, wide range, variety of character and agility. Listeners often compare its warm, dark, reedy timbre to that of a male baritone voice.As such, bassoons usually function as a bass role in ensembles. However, many pieces, especially orchestral, feature bassoon solos.In some concert bands, the bassoons are their own separate section from the oboes, but in other bands, the bassoons and oboes are combined in one \u201c\u201d section, which is what the Kitauji High School Concert Band does.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There are two bassoon players in the Kitauji High School Concert Band: Raina Kitamura - Principal Bassoon, Double Reeds Section Leader Mikino Oka - BassoonIn \"\", two new bassoonists join the ensemble: Eru Kabutodani - Bassoon Suruga Koteyama - ContrabassoonIn Rikka High School Marching Band, there is a bassoonist named Momoka Koyama.Together with the oboes, they form the double reed section. Bassoonists are typically stereotyped as being lonely, incompetent at their instrument, and generally dimwitted. However, Raina Kitamura completely defies their stereotype with her graceful playing during her solo in \"Crescent Moon Dance\" and her good representation of her section at section leader meetings.  Both Raina and Mikino were among the first to react to Reina Kousaka's superior playing during her trumpet audition, implying the pair's good musical talent awareness. Bassoons seen in \"Sound! Euphonium\" are probably based on Yamaha YFG-811 or YFG-812 model."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=7998","text":"Blue Girl, also called the Blue Bird or simply The Girl is a character in Liz and the Blue Bird. She is one of two main protagonists of the fairytale of the same name referenced in the film. She is a bird who took on human form to accompany Liz.Appearance.She is a quite young girl of a slim build with fair skin. She has short, bright blue hair which is swept to the back and left as if held in place by the wind. She usually wears a pale blue nightgown with a white collar and yellow buttons. Liz also adorns her hair with a cluster of red berries.Personality.The blue girl is a very energetic and excitable character. She is enthusiastic about nearly everything she does with Liz, frequently bursting into runs and twirls. She is quite compassionate, and wants to make Liz feel better by providing company. In the night, she sneaks away through the window, only to return to bed before dawn.When it comes time for her departure, the blue girl is deeply sorrowful, and at first rejects Liz's decision. However, she eventually comes to understand her reasoning, and sees herself away to appease Liz.Chronology.It is unknown where the blue girl came from or what her life was like prior to meeting Liz, except that she saw many towns and forests along the way, indicating she traveled quite far. During her stay with Liz, she is taken care of by her, and helps Liz with chores around the house, as well as providing company. The two spend many days side by side, collecting berries, having picnics, and playing.She is discovered missing one night by Liz, and is heard climbing back into bed. Liz then decides that it's best for her to be set free. The blue girl is completely distraught by her decision, but respects it and flies away from Liz's home.Nozomi Kasaki draws the similarity between herself and Mizore Yoroizuka, and Liz and the girl. Mizore picks up on this too, and the two separately decide themselves as Liz (Mizore) and the bluebird (Nozomi). However, later in the film when Mizore is confronted by Satomi Niiyama about how she thinks Liz feels, Mizore realizes that she is more similar to the bird. Nozomi simultaneously draws a similar conclusion that she is most similar to Liz when confronted by Yuuko Yoshikawa.She is never given a proper name. She is referred to as \"Blue Girl\" on most sources, but is also colloquially known as \"Blue Bird\" or \"The Girl\"."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=4292","text":"Chihiro Taki was the wife of Noboru Taki for approximately six to seven years until she passed away five years prior to the start of the \"Sound! Euphonium\" series.Appearance.Chihiro is depicted in the anime as having chin-length dark-brown hair, dark-brown eyes, she was quite short in stature and she had a slight figure. In the light novels, according to Noboru Taki, she is similar in appearance to Kumiko Oumae and Kaori Nakaseko. Personality.Chihiro's personality is described as sweet and gentle, but she also possessed unwavering perseverance. She was energetic and loved fitness activities, and was conscientious about her health.Background.Chihiro was an alumnus of Kitauji High School where she played the horn in the award-winning Kitauji High School Concert Band along with Masahiro Hashimoto (percussion) under the direction of Tooru Taki. However, in her three years at Kitauji, the concert band never won a gold medal at nationals. She and Hashimoto both went on to major in music at the same college, where they met Noboru Taki and Satomi Niiyama. Over the next few years, the four of them became inseparable friends. Not long after, she and Taki began dating, and they fell deeply in love with each other, described in the light novels as being \"bonded by their passion for music.\"Taki proposed to Chihiro in a unique way with a hair clip shaped like her favorite type of flower, and the two of them married right after graduation. Chihiro secured a job teaching a high school concert band, and always aimed to win a gold medal at nationals with her students because her own high school never succeeded in that goal. However, because she was more focused on keeping her students happy, the band never progressed very far in the local stages of the competition.Approximately five or six years into their marriage, Chihiro became terminally ill. Taki described her to be unbelievably strong during this time, even able to smile and comfort him in her final hour \"despite the pain and impending death.\" She passed away at the age of 29, leaving her husband brokenhearted.Legacy.After Chihiro's death, Taki became extremely depressed and even quit his job, and distanced himself for years from the music profession. Despite this, he eventually took it upon himself to dedicate his life to fulfilling his wife's unachieved dream of taking Kitauji (her alma mater) to win a gold award at the All-Japan band competition.Some of the smaller ways Taki keeps his wife in his daily life include choosing not to conduct with a baton (the style his wife preferred as a teacher), visiting shrines to pray for her, and keeping a photo of her taped in his conductor's folder, which he uses every day in rehearsal. He also wears his wedding ring each year on the anniversary of his wife's passing, and also purchases her favorite type of flower to leave at her grave.Chihiro is buried at a cemetery near a dam, beside a waterfall-- the meaning of the kanji of her husband's last name (\u6edd \"Taki\").Relationships.Noboru Taki.The two met in college and became closer until they became a couple where they loved each other deeply and they shared a very strong bond through their passion for music and mutual support. Their relationship progressed throughout college and they eventually married right after graduation. The couple lived happily for several years, but they never had children. However, after Chihiro, Taki fell into a long depression, indicating how deeply her death affected him. Years later, Taki continues to keep his wife in his heart. Satomi Niiyama.Chihiro was Satomi's senpai in college where the two grew very close. Chihiro looked after Satomi and Satomi held a deep admiration for her, even stating that she wished she was as lucky as Noboru Taki to have her as a girlfriend.  The name Chihiro is written in hiragana (\u3061\u3072\u308d), which has no special meaning. However, when written in kanji (\u5343\u5c0b), it could possibly mean \"thousand\" (\u5343) (chi) and \"fathom, armspan\" (\u5c0b) (hiro). Chihiro's surname Taki means \"waterfall, cascade, watering place\" (\u6edd).  After Chihiro's death, Taki could not touch musical instruments for a year or two without experiencing vivid flashbacks where he is described during this time as not even able to look at sheet music without crying."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3305","text":"Clarinet is an instrument. A person who plays any type of clarinet is called a \"clarinetist\" or \"clarinet player\".Construction.A clarinet is usually made out of plastic or wood. Many student instruments are made out of plastic, while most professional instruments are made out of wood. It consists of a straight cylindrical tube with an approximately cylindrical bore and a flaring bell. The clarinet is divided into 5 sections: the mouthpiece, which contains the single reed, the barrel, which is used to flatten or sharpen the pitch of the instrument, the upper and lower joints, which contain the instrument's 22 keys, and the bell.Variants.The term \"clarinet\" now normally refers to the \"B\u266d soprano clarinet\", the most commonly used type of clarinet in concert bands and orchestras, though there are many members of the clarinet family, including some rare instruments like the A\u266d piccolo clarinet, the D Clarinet, the C clarinet, the G clarinet (clarinet d\u2019amore), and the basset clarinet. Here are some of the most common clarinets encountered today: E-flat Clarinet.The \"E-flat Clarinet\", \"piccolo clarinet\" or \"sopranino clarinet\" is the highest pitched and smallest member of the clarinet family used in most ensembles. It is pitched in E\u266d like the alto and baritone saxophones, thus being a perfect fourth higher than the B\u266d soprano clarinet.A Clarinet.The \"A clarinet\" is a member of the clarinet family pitched in the key of A, commonly used in orchestras. Most professional clarinetists will have at least one B\u266d clarinet and one A clarinet, as they are used almost equally as often as the former in orchestral music. However, they are almost never used in concert band or other band music, in favor of the B\u266d variety.Basset Horn.Despite looking a lot like the alto clarinet, this instrument is pitched in F (or less often in G), a fourth below the B\u266d clarinet. The basset horn is fairly rare; it only appears occasionally in orchestral music. and almost never makes an appearance in bands. It was said to be Mozart's favorite woodwind instrument. He scored for it in pieces like the \"Grand Partita\" and the \"Requiem\". Alto Clarinet.The \"alto clarinet\" or less frequently the \"tenor clarinet\" is a member of the clarinet family pitched in E\u266d, an octave below the E\u266d soprano clarinet. It covers the range between the soprano and bass clarinet. This instrument is most commonly seen in concert bands, however not every ensemble has an alto clarinetist, such as the Kitauji High School Concert Band. That said, Tairu Kitayama plays the alto clarinet in his second year.Bass Clarinet.The \"bass clarinet\" is the most common member of the clarinet family outside of the B\u266d soprano clarinet. It is invariably pitched in the key of B\u266d, and is pitched an octave below the B\u266d soprano clarinet.Contra Clarinets.The \"contra-alto clarinet\" and \"contrabass clarinet\", collectively known as the \"contra clarinets\" are the two lowest members of the clarinet family. The contra-alto is pitched in E\u266d, one octave below the alto clarinet, and the contrabass is pitched in B\u266d, one octave below the bass clarinet. These clarinets are not especially common in any type of music, but they are most prevalent in concert bands. Some higher-level pieces call for the instruments, and they are seldom used in high school concert bands.Performance.Clarinets produce sound with a reed\u2014a thin and fragile sliver of cane, or, in modern times, plastic. The reed vibrates against the mouthpiece as the player blows into it, producing the distinct tone of the instrument. Different strengths or hardness of reed can be used to provide different tones, however, the harder the reed, the more air it needs to play.Clarinetists are very careful about their reeds- they are so careful about their reeds that they are often teased for being obsessed with their reeds. For a clarinetist, the greatest tragedy is the destruction of their favorite reed. There is also a running gag among clarinetists and musicians that everything that goes wrong with a clarinetist's performance is attributed to the reed. \"When in doubt, blame the reed.\" is a common saying.In a concert band setting, the principal clarinetist is typically responsible for providing a tuning pitch for the band (normally the role of the oboe in a symphony orchestra). The three most common tuning pitches clarinetists may provide are a concert B\u266d (as given by Hirone Torizuka), an A, and\/or and F.In many concert bands, the principal clarinetist is the equivalent of the \"concertmaster\" or \"concertmistress\" in a symphony orchestra. They are the second most significant person in the band after the conductor, and are typically ranked highest out of all the section principals in terms of the group pecking order. Some bands recognize the principal clarinetist with a separate stage entrance, during which they bow to the audience and tune the band before the conductor's entrance.Scoring.A typical B\u266d clarinet section in a concert band can range from as few as 6 clarinets to as many as 30, and bass clarinets usually number between 1 and 4. The B\u266d clarinets are divided into three parts\u2014firsts, seconds, and thirds\u2014in a pyramid ranking with more thirds than seconds, and more seconds than firsts.Since the middle of the 19th century, the bass clarinet has become an essential addition to the orchestra and wind band.E\u266d clarinets of both the sopranino and alto variety tend to only have one or at max two of each in a section, and oftentimes neither or one is missing, particularly the E\u266d sopranino clarinet since not every piece has a part for it. It is not uncommon for an E\u266d clarinetist to switch to or from a B\u266d clarinet if one of the pieces does not call for E\u266d clarinet.Today, the clarinet is commonly used in classical music (such as concert bands, orchestras, chamber music, and solo repertoire), military bands, marching bands, klezmer, and jazz.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There are 11 students who play clarinet and 2 students who play bass clarinet in Kitauji High School Concert Band, including:Maina Kase - Designated E\u266d clarinetHirone Torizuka - 1st clarinet, clarinet section leader, principal B\u266d clarinet, concertmistressRie Shima - 1st clarinet\/Clarinet section leader Hiyoko Ueda - 1st clarinetSakiko Suzuka - 2nd clarinetShouko Hagiwara - 2nd clarinet, photographerYouko Matsuzaki - 2nd clarinet\/Bass clarinet Sugami Tanaka - 3rd clarinetYumina Ooguchi - 3rd clarinetChieri Takahisa - 3rd clarinet\/Designated E\u266d clarinet Hisae Takano - Clarinet section leader (Sound! Euphonium 3)Hitoshi Usui - Bass clarinetJunko Koshikawa - Bass clarinetIn \"\", several new clarinet players and a bass clarinet player join the ensemble:Maya Hashida - E\u266d Clarinet (Sound! Euphonium 3)Miki KatouSeiko AshidaShiori HiranumaTairu Kitayama - Designated Alto Clarinet (Sound! Euphonium 3)Taku ImuraAyako Sakasaki - Bass ClarinetIn \"Sound! Euphonium 3\", four new clarinet players join the ensemble:Eiko MatsufujiSari YoshiiIchigo Nakata - Bass Clarinet Clarinetists are usually stereotyped as being very cliquey or very weird in the band, usually with the exception of the section leader. To some degree, \"Hibike! Euphonium \"stays true to this stereotype; the clarinet section in the transition card has many bizarre things, like a model planet and a hand puppet."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3578","text":"Concert band terminologyBecause \"Sound! Euphonium\" is an anime centered around concert band music, many terms the characters use in their everyday conversations may not be accessible to viewers who have not participated in a concert band before. This page lists in alphabetical order many of the words commonly found in the band jargon, specifically defining those terms which appear in the anime.Terminology Dictionary.8 to 5 Step.The standard marching band step size is 8 evenly paced steps in 5 meters, which is 62.5 centimeters in per step (meters in Japan and internationally, yards in the UK and the US). In short, this is called \"8 to 5 step.\" The Kitauji marching band practices this step size in preparation for their marching performance at SunFes. Other step sizes include 6 to 5 (larger strides) and 12 to 5 (tiny steps).When a band member marches in 8 to 5 step, it is referred to in the jargon as \"marching 8 to 5.\" For example, Sapphire Kawashima has trouble marching 6 to 5 in Episode 5 because she is too short for steps that big.Accent (music).An accent is an emphasis placed on a note to make it louder, heavier, or stand out. In rehearsal, Taki-sensei asks Narai Tanabe to add an accent to the beginning of his snare drum roll.The All-Japan Band Competition is a large wind band competition in Japan, organized by the All-Japan Band Association and the Asahi Shimbun. The competition is divided into four groups: junior high school, high school, college, and adult. Each symphonic band plays 2 pieces, a required piece, and a free-choice piece. There are three types of awards given: Gold, Silver, Bronze. Based on the sheer number of musicians participating, the All-Japan Band competition is the largest music competition in the world.Band Camp.Band camp refers to a period of somewhere between 1-3 weeks where a concert band or marching band holds intense daily rehearsals, typically 6-8 hours long. Sometimes band camp will last only 3 or 4 days with long hours of highly efficient rehearsal-- which is what the Kitauji Concert Band does.The purpose of this is to facilitate group bonding and provide an concentrated environment for musical improvement that is not possible during the school year. In American schools, band camp typically takes place during the 3-4 weeks of the summer right before school starts. In Japan, band camp is usually during the summer break between the first and second trimesters of the school year.Some band camps simply take place at school, and students commute to and from camp every day. Other camps are overnight camps, where band students sleep in cabins. These camps typically have more bonding time built in, and are more immersive. Regardless of location, most band camps include fun activities built in such as pool parties, talent shows, prank wars, and daily games. In Japan, many band camps also include firework (sparkler) parties.Battery.The battery is a commonly-used term that refers to the drumline, or the percussion section of a marching band. The percussion section of a concert band is not called a battery or drumline; these terms apply only to marching bands, or, in some cases, symphony orchestras.Short for the brass family, brass refers to the trumpet, horn, trombone, euphonium, and tuba sections of the band. Nearly all of the main characters of \"Hibike! Euphonium\" play brass instruments.Many people wrongly assume that the saxophone is also a brass instrument because of its color, but the saxophone's use of a single reed mouthpiece makes it a woodwind instrument.In a concert band or symphony orchestra, the de facto leader of all the brass is the principal trumpet, while the de facto leader of all the woodwinds is the principal clarinet (concert band) or principal oboe (orchestra).Colorguard (Guard).Colorguard, or simply \"guard,\" is the section of the marching band that tosses, spins, and twirls objects in sync with the band's music. The most common objects used by colorguard are flags and rifles, although guard can also use sabers (swords), pom-poms, ribbons, batons, and rubber balls. Members who play instruments in a concert band setting that cannot be used for marching (such as contrabass, like Sapphire Kawashima, or oboe, like Mizore Yoroizuka) will join colorguard in marching band. The Kitauji colorguard uses pom-poms and flags in their parade at SunFes.Conductor.The conductor leads the musical direction of the ensemble. Contrary to what most people believe, the conductor's primary purpose is not to maintain tempo (tempo is the responsibility of each individual member). Rather, the conductor's main purpose is to unify the ensemble both as students and as musicians, and also to teach his own musical interpretations to the ensemble, using verbal and body language to communicate musical expression to influence each player's style.The conductor's job is also to execute clear meter-- which is less important for simple meters like 4\/4 or 3\/4 time, but very important for music that uses unusual meter like 7\/4 or 5\/8 time. For example, in Episode 13 at the final performance, Noboru Taki chooses to conduct 6\/4 time in a distinctive 3+3+2+2+2 way that helps dictate how the band should be phrasing their music.Drum Major.The drum major is the student leader of the marching band, and sets the tempo and keeps time, either by using a specific form of conducting designed for marching bands, or by using a large baton and whistle in parades. Sometimes it is a combination of the three. \"Drum Major\" is a title, and written in lowercase when referring to it, unless used to describe a person; e.g. \"Drum Major Tanaka Asuka.\"Drumline.The drumline is a commonly-used term that refers to the battery, or the percussion section of a marching band. The percussion section of a concert band is not called a battery or drumline; these terms apply only to marching bands, or, in some cases, symphony orchestras.Embouchure.Embouchure (pronounced \"ON-buh-sure\") is the use of facial muscles and the shaping of the lips to the mouthpiece of woodwind instruments or the mouthpiece of the brass instruments. Each instrument has a unique embouchure that takes time and practice to learn. While woodwind embouchures are more varied, brass embouchures are quite similar across the board, and so a horn player like Shuuichi Tsukamoto could easily switch to trombone if so desired. A well-developed embouchure helps a player develop good sound quality; a poorly developed embouchure leads to poor sound quality. Hazuki Katou, a beginner, has yet to develop a proper tuba embouchure, and so is still struggling with basic tone production.Ictus.In conducting, the ictus is a quick flicking motion of the conductor's fingers, wrists, or baton that signifies the exact moment the beat falls in his stroke. It is very easy to follow the tempo of a conductor who has developed a clear ictus. In \"Hibike! Euphonium, \"some of the students initially complained that Taki-sensei's ictus was unclear and difficult to follow because of his refusal to use a baton.Phrasing.In music, the act of phrasing is to express the shaping of notes in time. Phrasing involves determining whichnotes to group together as one unit (a \"phrase\") and when to crescendo or diminuendo between phrases or throughout phrases. In Episode 7, Taki-sensei criticizes the saxophone section's poor choice of phrasing in the lyrical woodwind section of \"Crescent Moon Dance\".Earlier, during the second audition between Reina Kousaka and Kaori Nakaseko, one of the major differences between their performances lay in their choice of phrasing. Reina outperformed Kaori largely because she was able to create longer phrases due to her stronger air support, and had put more thought and intent into her choice of phrasing.Piece vs. Song.Classical musicians and concert band members are \"very \"adamant about maintaining the differentiation between a \"song \"and a \"piece. \"A \"song\" refers to shorter and less serious music, typically with singers. Both folk and popular music would be considered songs. A \"piece\" is a more serious composition that has more complex phrasing, and typically does not have a human voice as the main focus. Both \"Crescent Moon Dance \"and \"March \"Wind of Provence\" \"are pieces, not songs, and many band members can become very upset when outsiders casually refer to them as \"songs.\"Principal Player.A principal player, sometimes called the \"first chair,\" is typically the most skilled player in each instrumental section. This player typically is charged with playing any solos written in the music, and if the conductor sees it fit to reduce the amount of players playing a part, the principal player will typically be the \"last one standing.\"A principal player is not necessarily a section leader; for example, Takuya Gotou plays principal tuba, but Asuka Tanaka is the section leader of the bass section. A list of principal players in the Kitauji Concert Band can be found .Score Order.To say that a list of musicians and\/or instruments is in \"score order\" means that it is listed in the same order that the various instruments are lined up in a conductor's score. When listing musicians or sections in a concert band or orchestra, it is customary to do so by score order (rather than alphabetical or numerical). The score order for concert band is as follows (A * indicates this instrument may not always be used): Piccolo Flute Oboe Bassoon Contrabassoon* E-flat Clarinet* B\u266d Clarinet Alto Clarinet* Bass Clarinet Soprano Saxophone* Alto Saxophone Tenor Saxophone Baritone Saxophone Trumpet Horn in F Trombone Euphonium Tuba Percussion Double BassIn full orchestral score order, these instruments would then be followed by harp, piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. If a full choir is present, the string instruments would be preceded by the soprano, alto, tenor, and bass singers.Section Leader.The section leader is the decision-maker and usually the best player in his\/her instrumental section, though that is not always the case. Sometimes, small sections are combined into one section, such as the Kitauji Concert Band's bass section\u2014comprised of tubas, euphoniums, and contrabass\u2014of which Asuka Tanaka is the section leader. Depending on the culture of each ensemble, the section leader is chosen either by audition or by popular vote for seniority or playing ability. A list of section leaders in the Kitauji Concert Band can be found .It should be noted that a principal player does not necessarily equal a section leader, and vice versa.Sectionals.The term \"sectionals\" is used when the band breaks off into its individual \"sections\" (usually divided by the instrument you play) in order to practice as a group. During this time, the section leader usually helps the section members work on what they need help with the most. With all of the sections working on their own individual parts of the music, when the band meets for rehearsal next time, all of the smaller \"pieces\" fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.Tuner.A tuner is a device used for measuring pitch, typically to the standard pitch of A440 (a stand A pitch), though there is a recent trend of many bands increasingly tuning sharper to A441, A442, or even A443. The Kitauji concert band tunes to A442. Degrees of pitch are measured in \"cents.\"Most tuners have a little needle that hovers in the center when the player is in tune, falls left when they are flat, and falls right when they are sharp. Hazuki asks what a tuner is during her first encounter with the brass band, and in the final episode, the clarinets nervously tune to a tuner in the warm-up room.Tutti.Tutti is a command seen in sheet music for ensembles, meaning \"together.\" It is a heads-up for musicians that they are about to play in unison. The opposite of tutti would be \"solo,\" meaning that the musician who has that part will be playing by themselves; \"soli,\" meaning that the musicians whom play the same instrument with that command will play by themselves as a section; or \"divisi,\" usually seen in parts meant to be played by more than one person per stand, and meaning that two or more musicians will split up instead of playing in unison.Tutti is also the title of \"Hibike! Euphonium's\" closing song.Short for the woodwind family, woodwinds consist of the following sections: piccolo\/flute, clarinet, saxophone, and . The specific instruments include the piccolo, flute, oboe, bassoon, E-flat Clarinet, B\u266d clarinet, bass clarinet, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, and baritone saxophone. Less frequently seen in concert bands but still very commonly used woodwind instruments include the alto flute, clarinet in A, alto clarinet, soprano saxophone, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, English horn, and contrabassoon. The woodwind section is much more diverse than the brass section because they are responsible for the most of the variations in color in the band, and hence would require a greater variety of timbres.In a concert band, the de facto leader of all the woodwinds is the principal clarinet, who may also be called the \"concertmaster\" or \"concertmistress\". In an orchestra, the de facto woodwind authority is the principal oboe. The de facto leader of all the brass is the principal trumpet, in both band and orchestra."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6489","text":"Contrabassoon, also called the double bassoon, is a musical instrument in the . A musician who plays the contrabassoon is called a \"contrabassoonist\". Scoring.The contrabassoon is the lowest-pitched woodwind instrument in common use. It is pitched one octave lower than the bassoon. It is a transposing instrument, with music notated an octave higher than sounding. The instrument is known for its distinct reedy, dark tone, as well as its unique paperclip shape. Contrabassoons are exceedingly rare in concert bands, usually only used if a piece specifically calls for one. A regular bassoonist will double the instrument in the piece during a performance. Like oboes and bassoons, contrabassoons are never used in marching bands, for a variety of reasons. The instrument is a regular member of orchestras though, and can most commonly be found here.Bassoonists will typically have a few years' experience before picking up the contrabassoon. It is generally not someone's first instrument, especially due to how expensive the instrument is.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".A new first-year member Suruga Koteyama is the only contrabassoonist in the Kitauji High School Concert Band. She appears in \"Sound! Euphonium: The Movie - Our Promise: A Brand New Day film\". Suruga Koteyama's contrabassoon seen in \"Sound! Euphonium\" is probably based on Takeda Bassoon Contrabassoon model (Yamaha doesn't make contrabassoons)."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3600","text":"Crescent Moon Dance is a piece for wind ensemble composed by Namie Horikawa (a fictional composer). In reality it was composed by Akito Matsuda, who wrote the rest of the \"Sound! Euphonium\" soundtrack. It is Kitauji's free choice piece for the competition of the main series.Structure.The piece features a prominent and difficult trumpet solo in the lyrical section, which Reina Kousaka auditions for and performs. It also features an oboe solo, performed by Mizore Yoroizuka. Asuka Tanaka also remarks that the piece offers many challenging and interesting parts for bass instruments. This is because the first part of the piece, as described in the novels, contains a challenging melody for the trumpet section that is then passed to the bass section in the second part, which makes it difficult to play.The novels described the piece as the number one most difficult piece on the list of pre-approved pieces released by the All-Japan Band Association judges. This is significant, as Noboru Taki chooses the piece for Kitauji anyway, hoping to impress the judges by playing something the other bands were unlikely to choose.The full conductor's score (without individual parts) for \"Crescent Moon Dance\" was released exclusively in Japan as a part of DVD sales. It is currently rather difficult to obtain from overseas.The Sensoku Gakuen College of Music Freshman Wind Orchestra performed \"Crescent Moon Dance\" live at a \"Sound!

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6521","text":"Cymbal is an instrument in the percussion family. A musician who plays cymbals is called a \"cymbalist\" or simply a \"cymbal player\". Construction.Cymbals are round, usually brass plates, with a small dome in the center. This dome has a hole drilled through it to allow the cymbal to either be mounted or have handles attached. The cymbal can usually be divided into 4 main sections: The bell (the previously mentioned dome), the bow, which can be further divided into the ride area (closest to the bell) and the crash area (further from the bell), and finally the rim or edge, the circumference of the cymbal.Cymbals come in a variety of sizes, with larger ones being louder and sustaining longer. Cymbals are also measured by their weight, determined by the thickness of the plate. Heavier cymbals have louder volume, more cut, and better stick articulation, while thinner ones have a fuller sound, lower pitch, and faster response. Their sound is also determined by their profile, the vertical distance between the bottom of the bell to the edge of the bow. Higher profile cymbals are more bowl-shaped and have a higher pitched.Crash Cymbals.The orchestral \"crash cymbal\" is perhaps the most famous variety. They can also be called \"clash cymbals\", since \"crash\" is also the name of the standalone cymbal used in drum set. Traditionally, they are used in pairs, and are played by quickly pressing together or crashing the two together (hence the name). They are held by a strap that runs through the hole in the bell. Aside from just crashing, crash cymbals can also be played by rubbing their edges together, tapping the edge of one against the body of the other, scraping the edge of one from the inside of the bell to the edge, or shutting them together and choking the sound by pressing the instruments against the player's body.Suspended Cymbal.A suspended cymbal is any type of cymbal which is played with a beater such as a stick or a mallet, rather than with another cymbal. This includes, but it not limited to the following:Crash Cymbal.The \"crash cymbal\" is a suspended cymbal with a loud, sharp \"crash\" which is used for occasional accents in music. It is mostly used as a part of drum sets. Typically, it is positioned to the left of the player, and there are usually 1-2 crash cymbals in a set.Hi-hat.The \"hi-hat\", sometimes also called a \"hihat\" or \"highhat\" is a combination of two equally sized cymbals parallel with the ground, facing each other, mounted on a stand. They can be pressed together by stepping on a pedal connected to the instrument. They are also played with sticks. It is usually furthest to the left on a drum set from the player's perspective.Ride Cymbal.The \"ride cymbal\" is a standard member of the drum set. It is quite large, and it provides a steady rhythm compared to the crash cymbal which is used for accents. It is placed on the far right of the set, above the floor tom. It is played with a drum stick and has a dark, rich tone.Splash Cymbal.The \"splash cymbal\" is essentially a small crash cymbal, used to add accents and effects to music. It is usually no larger than 13\" in diameter, with the normal size being 10\".China Cymbal.The \"China cymbal\" is a type of crash cymbal used to create bright, explosive effects. They are often called \"trash cymbals\" because of the sound they produce. They are named after their resemblance to Chinese gongs.Performance.Cymbal performance is highly dependent on the variety of cymbal. Some techniques that are fairly standard include rolls or tremolo, which are usually accompanied by a crescendo to great a grand, dramatic effect. Concert cymbalists also need to take care in selecting proper mallets, which can differ between soft yarn mallets or drum sticks depending on the desired effect. Cymbals can also be played in quite unusual ways, such as Claude Debussy's \"La Mer\", where the player is instructed to rub a coin across the edge of the cymbal.Scoring.Cymbals are used across nearly every genre of music in one variety or another. They are used in pop, rock, jazz, and modern music in drum sets, especially hi-hat and crash cymbals, as well as concert bands, symphony orchestras, and marching bands.As part of a drumset, cymbals are usually notated at the top of or above the staff. As a standalone instrument, they are often written as part of a larger Percussion 1, 2, 3, etc. part, typically in joint with one or more other cymbals. Composers notate through text which cymbal to play at what part in the piece.In concert bands, marching bands, and orchestras, cymbals tend to play along with the bass drum since they mostly fill the same purpose. When combined, they add a loud accent effect to the music.Junna Inoue plays cymbals March \"Wind of Provence\", Crescent Moon Dance, and Takarajima.Narai Tanabe plays cymbals as part of a drum kit in Takarajima and \"Gakuen Tengoku\"."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3933","text":"Double Bass, also called the string bass, contrabass, upright bass, or simply bass, is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument. A musician who plays the double bass is known as a \u201cdouble bassist\u201d.Tuning.The double bass is generally tuned in fourths, The standard tuning (low to high) is E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G, starting from E below second low C (concert pitch). This is the same as the standard tuning of a bass guitar and is one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of standard guitar tuning.Scoring.Double basses are most often found in symphony orchestras, chamber orchestras, concert bands, jazz bands, and other string ensembles. Double basses are never included in marching bands, even as part of the front ensemble, in favour of bass guitars. Bass music is typically notated one octave higher than sounding to avoid excessive ledger lines.The double bass is the only commonly used string instrument in the Kitauji High School Concert Band, which otherwise consists of only wind and percussion instruments, though guitars, bass guitars, and harps are not unheard of. There is typically only one string bass per concert band, and the bassist is considered a member of the bass section.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".Midori \"Sapphire\" Kawashima is the only string bass player in the Kitauji concert band for the main anime series. In \"Sound! Euphonium 3\", she is the bass section leader.In and \"\", a second contrabass player, Motomu Tsukinaga, is introduced in Kumiko's second year at Kitauji High School.The four main bowed string instruments are the violin, viola, cello, and the double bass. The first three instruments are almost never used in concert band music. Some basses have a low \u201cC\u201d extension that, when added, allows the E string to go to a low C string. The octobass is actually the lowest instrument in the string family, but there are only 2 playable replicas in the world."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=7881","text":"Drum Set, also called a drum kit or simply drums is a collection of percussion instruments which form a larger cohesive one. Someone who plays a drum set is called a \"drummer\" or simply a \"drum player\".Construction.The modern drum set's instruments typically consist of the following:A snare drum on a stand between the player's knees.A bass drum on the floor between the player's knees, operated by a pedal by the right foot.1 or more tom-toms, typically 1-2 rack\/hanging toms mounted on the bass drum, and 1 floor tom on the player's right.3 cymbals; a hi-hat to the far left, a crash cymbal behind the snare, and a ride cymbal to the far right behind the floor tom.The drum sets components can be divided into 4 categories:Breakables (Snares, cymbals, sticks, stools, and sometimes bass drum pedals)Shells (Bass Drum and toms)Extensions (Non-standard instruments like tambourine)Hardware (Stands and pedals)This distinction is important when it comes to multiple bands using a single drum set. Drummers often want to bring their own equipment, as it may be better than what is provided or be personalized. \"Breakables\" refer to what is provided by the guest drummer. Snare drum and cymbals are core to this, as they are particularly individualistic. Players may need a certain tone or may be made of a different material. Snare and cymbals are also the most-used components and can be broken easily by poor technique. Snares frequently don't match the kit they are paired with as well.Configurations.Three-Piece.A 3 piece set is the most basic variety. It features a snare drum, a hi-hat, a bass drum, a single hanging tom, and a suspended cymbal, the latter two being mounted on the bass drum. It is mostly used in small bands, or as drum sets for children.Four-Piece.A 4 piece set is a step up from the 3 piece, adding another tom, either a second hanging tom or a floor tom, and another suspended cymbal to give a distinct ride and crash. The 4 piece with floor tom is very popular in jazz and rock music, while the 4 piece with a second hanging tom is useful for small, cramped venues like cafes, pubs, and lounges.Five-Piece.The 5 piece is the most common, and therefore standard kit. It adds an additional tom, either a second hanging tom or floor tom, to give 3 toms total. This allows for low, mid, and high range drums, and thus greater capabilities. 5 pieces may also have one or more effect cymbals, including the splash cymbal or china cymbal. This requires more stands, and as a result, many professional level drum kits provide no hardware at all, allowing the player to select what they need.Performance.Drumming consists of two main elements: Grooves and fills. Grooves are the rhythmic patterns provided by the drum to set the \"feel\" for the song and help keep everyone in time. Fills are deviations from the normal pattern to add ornaments and accents to the music, particularly through the use of cymbals. Fills can be a few simple beats, or a few bars long. They are useful to add flavor and to help indicate or transition to different parts of the song.Drum solos are also quite popular. While other solos like on guitar tend to have rhythm instruments playing in the background, all other players stop to put the focus on the drummer. These are the most popular in jazz, but can also be observed in rock.Drummers have to develop a specific technique for holding their sticks. There are two types: traditional, and matched. The traditional grip features an overhand grip for the right and an underhand for the left. This was originally developed for military side drum playing, but has carried over to the drum set. The matched grip uses the same grip for both hands, almost always the overhand. There is variation in both grips, and a lot of disagreement over whether or not this impacts the sound produced significantly.Scoring.Drum sets are most commonly used in rock, jazz, blues, and pop music. They can also be seen in concert bands, marching band front ensembles, and symphony orchestras, but typically only for pieces which are arrangements of a song in one of the previously mentioned genres of music. They may also be used if there are not enough percussionists to play the individual instruments, and thus substitute the concert varieties for what is available in a drum kit.As portrayed in \"Hibike! Euphonium\".Narai Tanabe has played the drum set in many pieces such as Takarajima and \"Gakuen Tengoku\". He has proved to be quite proficient in the instrument."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3251","text":"Euphonium is a member of the brass family and the titular instrument of \"Hibike! Euphonium\", and the instrument of which the main character, Kumiko Oumae, plays. A person who plays the euphonium is sometimes called a euphoniumist, euphophonist, or a euphonist.Variants.Baritone Horn.The Baritone Horn is similar to a euphonium and uses a similar fingering system. The euphonium, tuba, baritone horn and alto\/tenor horn are shaped similarly, but in different sizes. In size comparison, the euphonium is smaller than the tuba, but bigger than the baritone horn. Together, the euphonium, baritone horn, and alto\/tenor horn are all part of the saxhorn family of instruments.Scoring.The euphonium is used in symphonies, orchestras, school bands, and marching bands. It can be played in either bass or treble clef, with the bass clef written in concert pitch as a C instrument, and the treble clef being written in B\u266d sounding a major ninth, which is an octave plus a whole step, lower than written. This change in clef does not affect the way the instrument sounds, it is simply different between sheet music. It is a non-transposing instrument known for its distinctive tone color, wide range, a variety of character and agility. Notable orchestral pieces of music that call for the instrument include Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\", Richard Strauss' \"Don Quixote\", and Dmitri Shostakovich's \"The Golden Age\".As portrayed in \"Hibike! Euphonium\".There are three students that play the euphonium in Kitauji High School Concert Band:Kumiko Oumae - First-year instructor \/President (Sound! Euphonium 3)Asuka Tanaka - Principal euphonium, vice president, drum major, bass section leaderNatsuki Nakagawa - Vice president In, a new euphonium player, Kanade Hisaishi, joins the ensemble.In Kumiko's third year, Maya Kuroe joins as a euphonium player.Additionally, Masakazu Shindou, one of the judges at the All-Japan Band Competition, is a world-famous euphonium player.Euphoniums are often confused with baritone horns, and, less frequently, alto\/tenor horns. This confusion is caused by the fact that in many cases - particularly among students - the Euphonium and Baritone Horn are used interchangeably in performing ensembles. They are pitched the same and have the same tessitura, but their bore (interior of the tubing) shape is different. The Euphonium is conical - its bore size (internal diameter) gradually increases from the leadpipe (where the mouthpiece is inserted) to the bell flare. Other conical instruments include the (French) Horn and Tuba. The Baritone Horn is cylindrical - its bore size is consistent all the way up to the bell flare. Other cylindrical instruments include the trumpet, trombone, mellophone, and tenor horn. The tenor horn, called alto horn in America and Althorn in Germany and Austria, is pitched in Eb and has a similar tessitura to the Horn. It is significantly smaller than a Baritone Horn or Euphonium.Kumiko's and Kanade's euphonium is based on Yamaha YEP-621 model.Asuka's euphonium is based on Yamaha YEP-621S model.Natsuki's euphonium is based on Yamaha YEP-321 model."}

A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a \"flute player\", \"flutist\" or \"flautist\".Construction.The flute is usually made out of metal, mostly silver, although there are more expensive instruments made out of gold or platinum. Less expensive flutes are made of polished brass or nickel silver(brass+nickel), though silver plated or sterling silver flutes produce the best sound. The instrument is divided into three sections-the head joint, which contains the lip plate and hole which the musicians blows across to make a sound, and the body joint and foot joint, which contain the instruments 16 keys.Some flute manufacturers will give many options for the player to customize their instrument,among them,tube wall thickness,open hole or closed hole,inline or offset right hand keys.Variants.A flute that is played vertically, such as a tinwhistle or recorder, is called a \"fipple flute\", while the standard horizontal flute is called \"transverse\".Alto Flute.The alto flute in G, pitched a perfect fourth below the C flute, is rarely seen in band music, but has made appearances in some great orchestral scores, including \"Daphnis et Chloe\" by Ravel, \"The Rite of Spring\" by Stravinsky, and \"The Planets\" by Holst.Furthermore the alto flute has found favor in jazz and bossa nova music because of it's dark velvety,even aquatic tone and excellent blending capabilities,especially with the alto saxophone,providing \"one of the most workable of modern sounds.It has coolness and body.\",according to Henri Mancini,who is famous for composing the Pink Panther theme. The Alto flute will require a large amount of air from the player in order to produce a great sound.Bass Flute.The bass flute in C is pitched an octave below the C flute.The bass flute is not generally used in concert band music but due to it's very dark,expressive and esoteric sound,it,like the alto flute has found favor in jazz,bossa nova,film music,contemporary and avant-garde classical music.Perhaps the most famous use of the bass flute is in Antonio Carlos Jobim's instrumental version of Wave from the Album Wave, where it has been given a solo roleBass flute may come in both horizontal or vertical versions,in which the vertical bass flute may be offered with a foot joint with a range to low G (G2).The bass flute requires copious amounts of air in order to be able sound great and to be able to deliver a beautiful,musical phrase. Lower Flutes.There are also several, even rarer large flutes than the bass flute. These instruments include the contra alto flute in G\/F, the contrabass flute in C, the subcontrabass flute in G\/F, and the double contrabass flute in C.Performance.The flute is played by blowing air over a small hole called the embouchure hole on the head joint of the instrument. The air then vibrates within the instrument to produce a note. Because a lot of the air doesn't even make it into the instrument, flutes require the same amount of air as a tuba, and thus require the player to have an exceptional lung capacity.Unlike saxophones, oboes, bassoons and clarinets, flutes do not have an \"octave key\" to help them shift between octaves. They instead use air control and embouchure to change octaves. This means players change the shape of their mouth and change the direction and speed of the air to play different octaves.Scoring.Flutes are used in many different types of ensembles, such as wind ensembles, symphony orchestras, and marching bands,jazz big bands and have been used in every genre of music.In school bands, the best or second-best flautist is usually chosen to play the piccolo.A typical concert band has a flute section ranging from as few as 4 to as many as 15 members, and usually no more than one piccolo player. Flutes are typically divided into two or three parts-- firsts, seconds, and thirds-- in a pyramid ranking with more thirds than seconds, and more seconds than firsts.The modern flute uses the B\u00f6hm (Boehm) system for the keys,which means the flute shares certain fingering similarities with the saxophone and clarinet.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There are currently 9 students who play flute in Kitauji High School Concert Band, including: Yoriko Souga - Designated piccolo, librarian Kotoko Himegami - 1st flute, flute section leader, principal flute Tsune Watanabe - 1st flute, alumni coordinator Sari Takahashi - 1st flute\/Designated piccolo (\"\")\/Flute section leader (Sound!

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6441","text":"Harp is a large plucked string instrument. It is believed to be one of the oldest musical instruments in the world, possibly existing as early as 3000 B.C. A typical concert pedal harp has 47 strings, as well as 7 foot pedals. The harp is played by plucking the strings with both hands. Harp music is read the same way as piano music, the right hand typically plays the melody, and the left hand typically provides harmonic support. Unlike pianists, harpists do not use their pinkie fingers. Harps also have a wide variety of extended or exclusive techniques, one of the more known being the glissando, where a harpist glides their fingers across the strings. Glissandos are possible on other instruments too, but are very idiomatic for the harp, and therefore quite iconic. On a pedal harp, there are 7 foot pedals, one for each note of the diatonic scale. They each have three positions, flat, natural, and sharp. Harpists will move the pedals when changing key, and also when accidentals occur. There are also other varieties of harp, like the lever harp, which uses levers to accomplish similar. In large ensembles and orchestras, pedal harps are used nearly exclusively. Harp players are usually called harpists.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".In Kitauji High School Concert Band, Miyoko Oono plays the harp during Liz and the Blue Bird. However, usually she is a percussionist.Variations of the harp exist all around the world, including the Irish (Celtic) Harp, the lever harp, boat harps of Egypt, and the uncommon South American harps.Most harpists are women"}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3356","text":"Horn in F is a instrument. A musician who plays the horn is called a \"horn player\" (or less frequently, a \"hornist\"). The most common iteration of the Horn used in concert band and orchestral settings is the Full Double, which is pitched in F with a change valve to raise it to the key of B\u266d.Construction.The instrument is made up of approximately 4 meters of tubing wrapped into a coil with a flared bell. The main tubing on an F horn is about 12\u201313 ft (3.7\u20134.0 m) long and that associated with the valves adds additional length to achieve up to about 17 ft (5.2 m) of tubing overall. Material.Horns are made out of brass, an alloy of copper and zinc. The most common variant is \"yellow brass\", which contains roughly 80% copper and 20% zinc). Some examples are made from \"nickel-silver\", which is an alloy of roughly 60% copper, 20% nickel and 20% zinc. Less common are gold brass and rose brass, which each contain 85-90% copper and 10-15% zinc. Every manufacturer uses a slightly different formula. The reason for the differences is a matter of timbre. The more copper in the alloy, the warmer and darker an instrument tends to sound. For aesthetic purposes, some horns are covered with a thin plastic coating called lacquer. Many hornists are averse to lacquer, as it does have a negative impact on tone quality, and as it peels over time, it is difficult to handle.Discount instruments are often cut with tin to save on construction costs.Components.The tubing is divided into three sections. The leadpipe, corpus and bell flare. The leadpipe is the first branch, which connects the mouthpiece to the rest of the instrument. Historically, these were much longer and interchangeable components called \"crooks\" which were used to adjust the fundamental pitch of the instrument. The corpus is the center of the instrument. This includes the tuning slides, valve clusters, and all the tubing they connect through. The bell flare is the final branch of the instrument. It is a separate piece that is soldered into the corpus. On many modern instruments, the bell itself is detachable.Bore.The Horn, like the Euphonium and Tuba, is conical rather than cylindrical. This means the inner diameter, or bore size, gradually increases between the leadpipe and the bell flare. On trumpets, trombones, baritone horns and mellophones, the bore size is consistent throughout the entire corpus, only increasing in diameter at the bell.Valves.Most modern Horns will have three to four main valves operated by the index through pinkie fingers, and one to three \"change valves\" operated by the thumb. The \"first\" valve (the rotor closest to the player) lowers the pitch by a whole-step (i.e., E-D). The second rotor lowers the pitch by a half-step (i.e., E-E\u266d). The third lowers the pitch a whole- plus and half-step (i.e., C-A). Some horns will have a fourth rotor to change the pitch two whole-steps plus one half-step (C-G). This is less common on instruments with change valves, and on many models often is operated by the thumb in lieu of a change valve.Change valves redirect the airflow in the corpus to a separate series of tubing to enable playing in a different key. A single horn, usually pitched either in F, F-alto, B\u266d, B\u266d-alto, E\u266d or E\u266d-alto, will have no change valves. Most student models are pitched in F and have only three valves. Professional models may have a fourth valve (often called an F-extension on a single Bb-alto horn) either operated by the thumb or pinkie, and possibly a stopping valve. A stopping valve raises the pitch a half-step. It is used to correct a pitch when a player stops the airflow by shoving his right hand or a stopping mute up the bell, as doing so lowers the pitch a half step. Some modern music calls for this as it has a very specific tone quality.The standard orchestral double horn will have one change valve operated by the thumb to switch the horn either from F to B\u266d or B\u266d to F, depending on how the instrument is configured. Triple horns, a relatively new invention, are not yet standardized. Most have a third set of tubing pitched in either F alto or Eb alto.Horns pitched in F-alto, B\u266d-alto, and\/or E\u266d-alto are called descant horns. Single, double and triple descant models exist. On most triple horns, the third \"side\" (set of slides only operating when a change valve is activated) is usually a \"descant\". The purpose of these instruments is to alleviate the difficulty of Baroque and some Classical music which sits at the top of, and often above, the written range of the modern instrument and can be difficult to play for sustained periods on single F, B\u266d or orchestral double horns.The purpose for the different F, B\u266d and E\u266d \"sides\" of the double and triple instruments is to make hitting certain notes easier, particularly in the upper register.There are several different types of valve systems in use. The German rotary system is the most common. A rotor, operated by a string mechanism or ball-bearings, rotates to open or close additional tubing, which lowers the pitch. The French piston and Viennese double-piston (or pumpenvalve) systems operate by vertically pushing one or two cylinders, redirecting the airflow from one set of tubing to another. Vienna Horns, or Pumpenhorns, are still used today in Vienna, though rotary horns are more common elsewhere in Austria. French-style horns, more commonly called Cors \u00e0 Pistons, were common in both France and Great Britain until the 1970s, when German-style rotary horns started to become more ubiquitous.Performance.Posture.Modern instruments are performed standing or sitting upright. The horn is ideally positioned so that the first segment of the leadpipe is parallel to the ground, at least as much as possible, with the bell resting on the right knee, or held above it. A player's left hand operates the valves, while the right hand is positioned inside the bell flare to control intonation and adjust tone quality.Embouchure.A player blows air through the center of his lips while keeping the corners tight to affect a buzz. The buzz creates vibrations that the horn translates into pitches.Contemporary Horn players generally approach embouchure and mouthpiece placement in one of two ways. The more common of the two is ansetzen (De. Apply\/attach), in which the performer places the mouthpiece outside the red of his lip. The alternative, einsetzen (De. Insert), is defined as when a player inserts the mouthpiece into the red of his lip. Traditionally, ansetzen is preferred by high players, and einsetzen is preferred by low players.Air.Adjusting air speed and shape through the lips allows a hornist to traverse the instrument's overtone series, or \"open notes\". The written open notes on a horn are pedal C, low C, low G, middle C, E, G, B\u266d, C, D, E, F#, G, (out of tune) A, (out of tune) B, C. The use of valves allows for a horn to have a full chromatic range between its highest and lowest notes, along with better intonation. On classical- and Romantic-era natural horns (but not Baroque), the right hand would be used to bend the air to allow for some chromatic tones in lieu of valves.Scoring.In a concert band, the Horns will appear on the score toward the bottom, between the trumpets and trombones. In an orchestra, the Horns will appear in the middle, between the bassoons and the trumpets. A score will usually call for 2 or 4 horns, playing in pairs (1&amp;2, 3&amp;4), and occasionally as a section. The 1st and 3rd parts are typically high, and the 2nd and 4th are low. In many concert band pieces written for students, the horns and alto saxophones are almost always doubling each other, as the two instruments have similar ranges, and many bands have an abundance of saxophones, but no horns. In music intended for professional ensembles, this is far less common.The orchestral double horn in F\/B\u266d is the horn most used by professional bands and orchestras. Classical music is often written in any number of different keys, as historical examples had interchangeable parts to allow for different overtones series. Most modern players will transpose for their instruments, but there are ensembles dedicated to historical performance that will use period-appropriate horns.Modern horn parts are written in the key of F and in treble clef. When the part goes into lower ledger lines (below G) for extended periods, it is common for the music to switch to bass clef for that section.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There are five students that play horn in Kitauji High School Concert Band including: Juri Sawada - 1st horn, horn section leader Hiro Kahashi - 2nd horn Michiyo Morimoto - 3rd horn\/Horn section leader (Sound!

Chihiro Taki, a wife of Noboru Taki, was also a horn player, and majored in horn in college. Shuuichi Tsukamoto also played horn prior to high school, where he switched to trombone.The proper name of the horn is simply the \"Horn\", or \"Horn in F\" (or whatever key the piece calls for). French Horn is a misnomer for the instrument that is not recognized in the professional music world. Most modern instruments actually use a German design. There is some dispute as to where the misnomer \"French Horn\" originated. The prevailing theory is that the Horn was first used as an ensemble instrument in France. Originally the Horn, like the carved animal horns it replaced, was only used as a military signalling and hunting instrument. During the Renaissance, however, when street bands began to form, some horn players would join in. The traditions that led to modern horn performance and construction, however, originated in Austria and Bohemia.In \"Sound! Euphonium\", the horn section notably seems to change significantly from being laid-back and lazy to hardworking and serious over the course of the first season; they tend to be used as a showcase of how the band is becoming more determined and serious. As a result, they are arguably among the more well-developed secondary characters.Horns seen in \"Sound! Euphonium\" are based on Yamaha YHR-567 Full Double model."}

It is the main setting of \"Sound!

Beside the music room is the instrument storage room, where school-owned instruments are stored.In the day, it is used by other teachers as a general music education classroom. In order to use the room for rehearsal, Kitauji's band students must move desks and chairs every day to make room for their ensemble set-up, then tear down after rehearsal and restore the room to its usual appearance as a regular classroom.Wealthier schools like Sapphire Kawashima's Junior High school, Seijo, could afford a designated band room, to be used specifically as a rehearsal space, in which students would not need to change the set-up every day.In the novel, the music room is located on the 3rd floor on the north end.Uniforms.Kitauji students are required to wear uniforms to school every day. Female students wear brown sailor shirts with brown pleated skirts in the fall and winter, and white sailor shirts with light blue pleated skirts in the spring and summer. Three colors (red, blue and green) of sailor ties worn around the neck identify their year in school. New freshmen in each year use the color of previous generation of third year students and they will use that color until their graduation. For example: During Kumiko's second year at Kitauji, the first years wear green, the second years wear red and the third years wear blue.Kitauji's marching band uniforms for females consist of a blue, red, and white sleeveless top with gold buttons and gold trimming, a small shako hat, a pleated yellow and white skirt, white knee-high boots with heels, and white elbow-length gloves. Uniforms for males consist of white pants, white marching shoes, white gloves, and small shako hat, and a white, red, and blue short-sleeved top with gold buttons and gold trimming.

However, after Taki and Kousaka left the ensemble, it fell from glory and did not see a claim to nationals again, until the arrival of Noboru Taki.Before Taki Jr.'s revival, the ensemble was under the direction of Rikako-sensei, whom encouraged a lax culture within the ensemble. Her philosophy of valuing enjoyment over achievement, shared by many of the seniors, was met with fierce opposition from a group of first-years spearheaded by Nozomi Kasaki. This led to a major schism within the ensemble, during which the majority of the first-years left the ensemble. According to the anime, the party of first years was joined by many other talented students, leading to nearly half the band deserting by the end of the year.In the year after the schism, the Kitauji Concert Band was left with a severe shortage of second-years and an extremely harmful decrease in overall quality, as the many of students who quit were the best and brightest musicians in the ensemble.Competitions.Prior to coming under new direction, the Kitauji concert band had performed in high school band competitions and exhibitions with other schools. Such events include Sunrise Festival (SunFes) and the prefectural competition - a possible gateway to the national competition, with other schools from around Japan. Similar high school band competitions exist in other countries, such as the United States, though the rules applying may vary. In Japan, competitions are typically conducted with the adjudicators selecting a set piece for all competing bands to play. They are then judged on how well that they can perform the piece, according to rhythm, dynamics, etc.In \"Hibike! Euphonium\", bands can place in the top 3 categories of gold, silver, or bronze. Gold placing bands are eligible for advancement to the nationals, but this is not guaranteed. Judges select bands from those that placed gold to advance to nationals, and therefore, not every band that placed gold may make it to finals. Such placement is called a \"dud gold,\" as was the case with Kumiko's junior high competition experience.Sectionals.Like most bands, the Kitauji concert band rehearses sometimes in \"sectionals\". This term refers to a rehearsal in which each instrument section rehearses apart from each other, as opposed to a full ensemble rehearsal. It allows for in-depth focus on parts specific to that instrument group that cannot always be addressed in a full ensemble rehearsal, and creates a greater sense of unity within sections.Larger sections such as the clarinet section will rehearse on their own, whereas smaller sub-sections such as euphoniums and tubas will rehearse together as one section.Instruments.Despite being referred to by some as a \"brass band,\" Kitauji High School's band is in fact a full wind ensemble, consisting of both brass and woodwind instruments, along with percussion and contrabass.

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=4240","text":"Kitauji High School Concert Band SchismThe Kitauji High School Concert Band Schism is a major event that occurs within the Kitauji High School Concert Band in the year prior to the beginning of the first \"Sound! Euphonium\" light novel. During the schism, nearly all of the first-years whom held significantly different goals and opinions from the rest of the upperclassmen quit the band, triggering a subsequent mass desertion. This led to a huge number of members dropping out during the schism.By the start of Kumiko Oumae's first year at Kitauji, the band had been reduced to nearly half its original size, and the remaining portion was left with a severe shortage of second-years.Background.The group of first years that initiated the mass desertion was led by flutist Nozomi Kasaki, the former band president from her middle school's concert band.A year before the schism, the concert band of Nozomi's middle school, Minami Junior High School, did not make the cut at the qualifying round of the All-Japan Band Competition, which created a lingering disappointment on Nozomi's part as well as the members of the ensemble whom went on to attend Kitauji High School. These students, along with Nozomi, saw their transition to high school band as a new opportunity to prove themselves at a higher level of band competition.Schism.Nozomi and her first-year peers quickly discovered that Kitauji's concert band was at the time mired within a culture of laziness and mediocrity, where participation and seniority were valued over achievement and talent. This attitude was encouraged by the director at the time, Rikako-sensei, as well as the seniors and section leaders.The first-years quickly grew extremely frustrated with both the ensemble and with Rikako-sensei, while the majority of the third-years wanted to maintain the prioritizing of seniority over merit. Acting in self-interest, most of the oldest students in the band who were in positions of power due to the seniority system opposed the efforts of the first-years to create a more goal-driven ensemble environment. However, many second-years in the band at the time became sympathetic to the newcomers' passionate cause to reach nationals.When the disagreement between the first-years and third-years broke out into open hostility, the second-years at the time split into two sides. Most of them came out in favor of either the freshmen or the seniors. Some, like Asuka Tanaka, did not care about the drama and continued to focus on playing music. Others, such as Haruka Ogasawara and Aoi Saitou, tried to mitigate the conflict without taking sides. These students did their best to resolve the situation when Nozomi and her cohorts threatened to quit. Despite their efforts, Nozomi and her followers eventually chose to leave the ensemble as a final statement, and many other talented students in the band began to quit as well. Nearly half the band had deserted by the end of the school year.The few first-year members who chose to stay included Natsuki Nakagawa, Yuuko Yoshikawa, and Mizore Yoroizuka, all students from Minami.Some of the members who quit joined the K-ON (light music) club in order to continue pursuing music.Aftermath.Many of the members currently in the ensemble are still emotionally affected by the events of the schism. Mizore Yoroizuka, Nozomi's former best friend, was deeply hurt by Nozomi's actions, and there is now a major rift between the two students. In addition, Haruka continues to battle feelings of insecurity over her inability to prevent the schism from happening. Aoi's decision to quit the band also partially stems from her disappointment with her own perceived failure to prevent the schism.There is also a general consensus within the ensemble that even with all the progress they achieved under Noboru Taki's tutelage, they would have been much more competitive had the first years stayed, since the members who left consisted of the best and brightest musicians of their year.When Nozomi tries to rejoin the band in the second season, Asuka makes every attempt to stop her, out of fear that Nozomi's presence will negatively impact Mizore's emotional state and thus her musical performance. Because Mizore is a keystone player in the band's success, Asuka does not want Nozomi's presence to jeopardize the band's newfound claim to nationals. Yet eventually, Nozomi and Mizore get together again, allowing Nozomi to rejoin. Nozomi Kasaki- spearheaded the branch of the schism that elected to leave. Rikako-sensei- encouraged the culture of mediocrity that Nozomi and the first years strongly opposed. Haruka Ogasawara- tried to prevent the schism. Aoi Saitou- tried to prevent the schism. Mizore Yoroizuka- remains severely affected by her broken friendship with Nozomi"}

She is the daughter of Kentarou Oumae and Akiko Oumae, the younger sister of Mamiko Oumae and a member of the Kitauji High School Concert Band who plays the euphonium. Appearance.Kumiko is a young fair-skinned teenage girl with shoulder-length light auburn hair that is curled at the bottom with bangs swept to the left side, amber eyes and an average height\/build. Personality.Within the story of \"Sound! Euphonium\", Kumiko is an ordinary girl to which interesting things happen. She is surrounded by characters that drive or instigate dramatic situations. Although she occasionally has a hand in the events around her, Kumiko mostly plays the role of a bystander, witnessing enough situations and exchanges that she receives both sides of a story. As a willing and nonjudgmental listener, she easily befriends everyone she meets and accepts both their flaws and strengths. However, Kumiko dislikes her own self because she knows she is a poor communicator who has difficulty making her wishes known to others, and so often listens instead of speaking.Kumiko is mostly friendly and polite, but she can be awkward and blunt sometimes due to her quirky habit of accidentally blurting out the first thing on her mind without restraint or tact. This lack of a filter is part her impulsive streak, a trait which also led her to enroll at Kitauji for a reason as trivial as its' uniform design, and also to accidentally ask Reina Kousaka to attend the Agata Festival with her. She also has a habit of dwelling on past situations to the point of obsessing over them in her head, such as her awkward encounter with Reina prior to entering high school.In addition, Kumiko sometimes compares herself to others too frequently. This is why she often puts up a \"good-girl\" face, but in reality, she is actually really distant.Over the course of the series, Kumiko grows more passionate about music and life in general, training hard to play the euphonium flawlessly as she finds the motivation and strength to become a better musician and better person.Background.Mamiko Oumae is one of the reasons behind Kumiko's interest in playing low brass instruments. Kumiko has been a well-experienced euphonium player since middle school, and was a member of the Daikichiyama Middle School Band, which was able to secure a gold award in the prefectural (first round) tournaments. However, the band was unable to qualify for the national-level tournament. The results of the competition created a rift between her and Reina Kousaka. Since then, the confrontation during the end of the prefectural tournament continues to haunt her as she tries to create a fresh start for herself in Kitauji High School.Chronology.On her first day in Kitauji High School, Kumiko learns of the school's own concert band and comments on its dismal quality. Meanwhile, she meets new friends in her class, namely Hazuki Katou and Sapphire Kawashima, the latter revealing her music background and her interest in joining the school band. Many things prevent Kumiko from joining, including her experience in the middle school prefectural tournament, and the fact that Reina Kousaka herself, who also enrolled in Kitauji High School, has just revealed her interest in joining the school band. Eventually, after much thought and seeing the eagerness of both Hazuki and Sapphire in joining the band, Kumiko decides to join as well, but not until she could resolve her past with Reina.The name Kumiko means \"long time\" (\u4e45) (ku), \"beautiful\" (\u7f8e) (mi) and \"child\" (\u5b50) (ko).Kumiko's surname Oumae means \"yellow\" (\u9ec4) (ou) and \"previous\/previously, before, earlier, front\/in front, former, above, one-time, fore part, privy parts\/privates, miss, presence, portion, for, since, forward\" (\u524d) (mae).According to the official \"Sound!

Kumiko speaks standard Japanese, despite being born in Kansai. Kumiko's school bag is plain and it seems that she is not interested in anything \"over-the-top\".  Kumiko is an indoors type of person and she does not get along with sports-oriented people, except for Hazuki Katou.  It was shown at least twice that Kumiko plays bass clef for her sheet music. It was also shown in the key of B\u266d Major, indicating that Kumiko plays a non-transposing instrument.

She likes to tease her younger sister, and she was also the person who inspired Kumiko to play and join the band. They appear to occasionally experience sibling arguments, but they share a close bond as sisters.Akiko Oumae.Akiko is Kumiko's mother. Little has been revealed so far in the anime about their relationship.Kentarou Oumae.He is Kumiko's father.Kitauji High School.Students.Reina Kousaka.Kumiko and Reina have a quite complicated relationship. In junior high, Kumiko saw Reina being upset and crying because they did not advance to the nationals despite getting gold. This prompts Kumiko to absent-mindedly ask if she really thought they could have advanced. This offends Reina, thus creating tension in their relationship.Every time they meet, Kumiko becomes very awkward, but Reina always behaves naturally and does not show any signs of embarrassment or discomfort. After several talks with each other, they resolve their issues and grow gradually closer to the point that they both blush when they see each other. In episode 8, Kumiko invites Reina to go to the Agata Festival with her, albeit unintentionally. However, after they begin conversing and relaxing with each other, they drop the polite form of speech and begin calling each other by first names by the end of the night, signaling a new level of friendship between them.Now that they are friends again, Kumiko is probably the closest to Reina, since they intimately hug each other and share a strong bond of trust. They both have even said to each other that they love each other. Kumiko also says that she \"will always stay by Reina's side\" when Reina would compete against Kaori. Kumiko said that she \"would never abandon her, even if it would cost her life.\" This indicates that the two share an amicable friendship that is on higher level from Kumiko's other friendships.Kumiko seems to show a less-seen side of herself to only Reina and at times, Shuuichi, one that is more fiery, stroppy, and determined, unlike the blandly polite facade she presents to acquaintances at school.Asuka Tanaka.Asuka is Kumiko's section leader and senpai, and is the one who discovers that Kumiko is a proficient euphonium player and ropes her into joining the bass section. In the first light novel, Asuka is very aware of her senpai status to Kumiko and thus always employs great discretion about her personal feelings when speaking to Kumiko. As the story progresses over the light novels, Asuka grows to care for Kumiko, and eventually invites Kumiko to her house and shares the story of her father with her. On the day of Asuka's graduation, she gives a book of euphonium pieces composed by her father to Kumiko, saying that Kumiko have better use for it now than she will post-graduation.Shuuichi Tsukamoto.Kumiko and Shuuichi are close childhood friends. However, in junior high, when Kumiko invited Shuuichi to her home to play, he calls her \"ugly\" and asks that she never speak to him again. Soon after they entered high school however, they end up being on good terms again and use that as an opportunity to freely talk to one another about various topics. They get along so well that they do not speak to one another using the polite forms of speech, except for in public places. It is later revealed that Shuuichi has a crush on Kumiko when he asks her to attend the Agata Festival with him. Kumiko seems unimpressed by his offer, and accidentally ends up asking Reina to join her instead. Shuuichi and Kumiko become very distant after this event and have not had a meaningful conversation since, except for the one before their competition performance, when Shuuichi told Kumiko that things were going to be alright after which they fist bumped each other. However, they still see each other as musical peers and have been using each other for inspiration to improve their playing. Prior to them being distant, she seems to show a less-shown side of herself to only Reina and at times, Shuuichi.In the light novel, Shuuichi tries to grow closer to Kumiko and nearly confesses to her the night before their final concert. He also gives Kumiko a hair decoration that's shaped like the white flower Taki gave his wife before he proposed. Asuka mentions the hair decoration on Kumiko after her graduation ceremony and asks if it's from her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Kumiko stumbles and eventually says yes revealing that she is also in love with Shuuichi, and they start going out later in the \"light novels\". In the \"anime\", the plot subverts this in season 2 in which they don't start dating at all.At the start of Hibike! Euphonium Movie 3: Chikai no Finale, Shuuchi confesses to Kumiko and they started dating. They nearly kissed during the summer festival to which Kumiko interrupts the moment as she became embarrassed. Later in the training camp for the upcoming regional competition, Kumiko decides to break up with Shuuichi by returning the hair clip he gave her as she is overwhelmed thinking about her future. However, she mentions to him that she is willing to date him again after their club activities are finished next year.Hazuki Katou.Hazuki is one Kumiko's first friends upon entering Kitauji High School, and Hazuki called Kumiko by her first name, which quite shocked Kumiko. Normally, Kumiko doesn't get along with sports-oriented people, but she gets along very well with Hazuki. They are on good terms and also, can talk to each other about various topics and so on.When Kumiko found about that Hazuki liked Shuuichi, she tried to support them as much as possible, and she even declined Shuuichi's invitation to a festival, so Hazuki could go with him instead. This proves that Kumiko cares for Hazuki a lot, and they are close friends.Sapphire Kawashima.Sapphire is also one of Kumiko's first friends upon entering Kitauji High School. Hazuki, Kumiko, and Sapphire are almost always seen with each other. Kumiko and Sapphire also get along and they are on very good, friendly and close terms and support each other. Her friends and other people close to her call her, Midori.Natsuki Nakagawa.Natsuki and Kumiko have a good and friendly relationship, as they both play the same instrument. However, it was later revealed that Natsuki was jealous of Kumiko since she played the euphonium better than her. Kumiko didn't realize this before she saw Natsuki practice very hard and when she didn't pass the audition. However, Natsuki later invited Kumiko to talk with her after the audition announcement. They talked about that and after that, they grew closer to each other.Teachers.Noboru Taki.At first, Kumiko thinks that Taki was very strict about practicing and going to the nationals, but she realizes that it is all to help the band. She respects him and sees him as a good teacher.When Taki cuts Kumiko from a euphonium part in Crescent Moon Dance, he does it as respectfully as he can, without mentioning her name. Later, he offers a second chance to be given to her for the second round of competitio, and reminds her to practice hard.Taki takes notice when Kumiko begins to practice harder, and, like he does with other students, encourages her. In the second light novel, Taki buys Kumiko and Mizore Yoroizuka each a bottle of sweet green tea when he finds them practicing in the school building late in the evening.When Kumiko is caught out in a typhoon with a broken umbrella, Taki drives her back to her apartment and then gives her his own black umbrella before dropping her off.After Taki fails to reach his own goals of having the band secure a gold award at nationals, he comes close to a breakdown in his office, shaking all over as he speaks, and tells Kumiko the full story of his wife, and her last living moments, and the promise he made to her. Kumiko consoles him with a few words. Taki thanks her, seeming to feel slightly better.Michie Matsumoto.Kumiko, like most of the other students, thinks that Michie is a very strict teacher. However, she also respects her and calls her \"Michie-sensei\" even when not speaking to her directly. Michie also seems to know Mamiko and gets along with Akiko, Kumiko's mother.Masahiro Hashimoto.Hashimoto is friendly to Kumiko, though she is not one of his percussion students. During a firework sparkler party, he sits down next to her in a quiet spot and, concerned, asks about Kousaka Reina's relationship with Noboru Taki. He accidentally lets slip during this conversation that Taki is a widower, and ends up telling Kumiko most of the full story.Other.Azusa Sasaki.Not so much known about their relationship, but Azusa and Kumiko were friends in junior high, and they later reunited when they were both performing at SunFes."}

She is one of two main protagonist of the fairytale of the same name referenced in the film. She works as a clerk in Arlt's bakery.Appearance.Liz is a young girl of average build and height. She has fair skin and bright turquoise eyes. She has long, golden-orange hair tied in a braid, draped over her right shoulder. She typically wears a cream-colored turtle neck and a pale yellow apron.Personality.Liz is a kind, but lonely person. She only socializes with the forest animals, feeding them bread from the bakery. When the Blue Girl arrives, Liz is quick to take action and welcomes the girl into her home to rest. Liz takes care of her, preparing food, doing laundry, and bathing her.Liz's emotions conflict with each other when she is faced with the decision to let the bird fly free. Both she and the bird have become dependant on one another for company, but Liz recognizes that it is cruel to keep a bird caged in her home, unable to spread its wings. Thus, in an act of love, Liz pushes her selfish needs aside and allows the bird to return to the sky where it belongs.Chronology.Liz spent her life quite monotonously, traveling to the city each morning to work in the bakery, and returning home at sunset to prepare dinner and go to sleep. On her days off, she spent time with the woodland animals. Once the blue girl arrived, she spent all her time taking care of her, as well as bringing her to the bakery while she worked.Liz noticed the girl was missing one night, with the window open.

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=5040","text":"Liz and the Blue Bird is a Japanese anime film produced by and directed by, and it premiered in Japan on April 21, 2018. Theatrical distributor released the film in theaters on November 9, 2018 in the United States (with an English dub cast).Plot.Mizore Yoroizuka is a quiet, introverted student in her final high school year, who is an oboist in the school's concert band. Her only friend, who occupies most of her thoughts, is Nozomi Kasaki, one of the band's flautists, who is much more outgoing and popular. Together, the two rehearse a duet from the musical piece Liz and the Blue Bird, which is based on an eponymous German fairy tale Nozomi loved as a child about a woman named Liz (represented by the oboe in the musical piece) and an unnamed bluebird turned human (represented by the flute) who become best friends and live together, until Liz ultimately decides to force the bird away from her house so it can live a fulfilling life.Although Nozomi spends time with other friends from the band, Mizore keeps herself isolated from everyone except Nozomi, and refuses her other bandmates' offers to spend time together. She also tries to express her love to Nozomi, but is never able to. Niiyama, a woodwind instructor, advises Mizore to apply for music school after graduation so she could become professional; she is not particularly interested at first, but changes her mind after Nozomi says that she might apply as well. However, their bandmates are worried, realizing that Mizore's only motivation for going to music school is to be together with Nozomi.As the concert approaches, Mizore and Nozomi grow apart. Mizore feels insecure towards Nozomi because of the previous year during which Nozomi proposed and convinced Mizore to join the band only to later leave it herself on a whim, leaving Mizore feeling abandoned, and persuaded that Nozomi could abandon her again at any time. Meanwhile, Nozomi shows jealousy at Mizore progressively opening herself to more people and being tutored by Niiyama, envious of her greater potential. Furthermore, the two have trouble perfecting their duet, both because of their increasingly complicated relationship and because of their trouble connecting with the characters from Liz and the Blue Bird; Mizore, in particular, does not understand why Liz would ever let go of the bird instead of keeping it with her forever.Eventually, the two come to a greater understanding of their relationship, thanks to the assistance of Niiyama and other members of the band; they notably come to realize that while they always associated Mizore to Liz and Nozomi to the Blue Bird, Mizore was actually closer to the Blue Bird, having to let go of her unconditional attachment so she can live her own life, while Nozomi was closer to Liz, who let go of the bird for its own good. At the next rehearsal, they perform the piece perfectly, with Mizore's performance being lauded by all. Nozomi confronts Mizore afterwards, having realized that Mizore had under-performed all along so the two would be on the same level. Nozomi also reveals that she did not really want to go to music school, and had only said so out of jealousy for the other, even though she knew she did not have the level necessary to be accepted. Mizore, upset that Nozomi seems to be abandoning her once again, confesses the extent of how important their friendship is to her, expressing how she loves her and calling the other her \"everything\". However, Nozomi only laughs, thanks Mizore and then leaves.Some time later, Mizore and Nozomi are seemingly still distant from each other. After they meet in the school's library, Nozomi offers to eat together outside.

In reality, it was composed by Akito Matsuda, who wrote the rest of the \"Sound! Euphonium\" soundtrack. It is the piece that the Kitauji High School Concert Band plays in the film of the same name and .The piece is in four movements- \u201cOrdinary Days\u201d, \u201cA New Family\u201d, \u201cA Decision of Love\u201d, and \u201cTo The Far Sky\u201d.The piece is best known for the third movement, featuring an oboe and flute duet. In the movie, this duet is performed by Mizore Yoroizuka and Nozomi Kasaki.Kitauji High School Concert Band's version of the piece was shortened for the competition.The Fairytale.The piece is based on the German fictional fairytale of the same name (Ger.-Liz und ein Blauer Vogel), a book which Nozomi loved as a child. It goes like this:Liz is the name of a lonely girl who only makes a living by selling bread at a bakery. After a mighty thunderstorm strikes, she goes outside and finds a blue-haired (unnamed) girl lying on the grass. The two instantly become close friends for a long time. However, after a while, Liz decides to let go of the girl so she can be free to do whatever with herself. The flute and oboe duet in the third movement are said to represent Liz and the blue bird.In terms of Nozomi and Mizore, the story almost seems to reflects their own relationship, with Nozomi discovering a lonely and silent Mizore back in middle school and eventually they might be going separate ways in college.Score and Parts.The official \"Liz and the Blue Bird\" score and individual instrument parts are available for purchase at the Print Gakufu Website.Instrumentation.Movement IPiccoloFlute 1, 2OboeBassoonContrabassoonB\u266d Clarinet 1, 2, 3B\u266d Bass ClarinetE\u266d Alto Saxophone 1, 2B\u266d Tenor SaxophoneE\u266d Baritone SaxophoneB\u266d Trumpet 1, 2, 3F Horn 1, 2, 3, 4Trombone 1, 2, 3EuphoniumTubaContrabassTimpaniSnare DrumBass DrumCymbalsGlockenspielXylophoneTriangleTambourineMovement IIPiccoloFlute 1, 2OboeBassoonContrabassoonE\u266d ClarinetB\u266d Clarinet 1, 2, 3B\u266d Bass ClarinetE\u266d Alto Saxophone 1, 2B\u266d Tenor SaxophoneE\u266d Baritone SaxophoneB\u266d Trumpet 1, 2, 3F Horn 1, 2, 3, 4Trombone 1, 2, 3EuphoniumTubaContrabassTimpaniSnare DrumTom-tomBass DrumCymbalsGlockenspielXylophoneWhipTambourineFlexatoneRatchetWind MachineMovement IIIPiccoloFlute 1, 2OboeBassoonContrabassoonE\u266d ClarinetB\u266d Clarinet 1, 2, 3B\u266d Bass ClarinetE\u266d Alto Saxophone 1, 2B\u266d Tenor SaxophoneE\u266d Baritone SaxophoneB\u266d Trumpet 1, 2, 3F Horn 1, 2, 3, 4Trombone 1, 2, 3EuphoniumTubaContrabassHarpTimpaniBass DrumCymbalsGlockenspielVibraphoneMovement IVPiccoloFlute 1, 2OboeBassoonContrabassoonE\u266d ClarinetB\u266d Clarinet 1, 2, 3B\u266d Bass ClarinetE\u266d Alto Saxophone 1, 2B\u266d Tenor SaxophoneE\u266d Baritone SaxophoneB\u266d Trumpet 1, 2, 3F Horn 1, 2, 3, 4Trombone 1, 2, 3EuphoniumTubaContrabassHarpTimpaniSnare DrumBass DrumCymbalsGlockenspielVibraphoneMusic sheet"}

These idiophones can vary in size, shape, and material, from the wooden bars of a xylophone, to the metal tubes of chimes, and the round disks of . They are also mounted on a frame of sorts that accommodates the needs of the instrument.Variants.In western music, there are 6 main types of mallet percussion instruments.Xylophone.The \"xylophone\" consists of a set of wooden bars that are struck with a hard, acrylic mallet. It has a sharp, crisp tone.Marimba.The \"marimba\", like the xylophone, consists of a set of wooden bars. The two differ in that marimbas are much larger, and use yarn mallets. It has a warm, rich tone compared to the xylophone.Glockenspiel\/Bells.The \"glockenspiel\", also commonly called \"bells\" is a, consisting of a set of small metal bars, struck with hard, often metal mallets.

The instrument has plenty of additional features including pedals and a motor. It has a mellow tone.Tubular Bells\/Chimes.The \"tubular bells\", also commonly called \"chimes\" is a unique mallet percussion instrument. It consists of a set of large metal tubes arranged like a piano, suspended vertically along its frame. It is quite loud and is often used to add color to pieces.Crotales.\"Crotales\", sometimes called \"antique cymbals\" are small percussion instruments consisting of disks of an average 10 cm (4\") in diameter. They usually come in chromatic sets which are played by striking with a mallet, or by striking two individual crotales together. It is a transposing instrument pitched in C, reading music two octaves below sounding. They are often used in orchestras and concert bands. They have a very bright, piercing tone. Crotales are often criticized for being out of tune, and since they cannot be retuned, the bells in question either have to be replaced, or the ensemble must tune to them.Saki Kayama played the xylophone in Takarajima, the former and glockenspiel in March \"Wind of Provence\", and both as well as chimes in Crescent Moon Dance.Miyoko Oono played marching xylophone at the Sunrise Festival.Sousuke Maeda played glockenspiel, xylophone, vibraphone, and chimes in Liz and the Blue Bird.Tsubame Kamaya is particularly talented at the marimba and other mallet percussion instruments."}

It is the fourth of several required pieces used as standard measures of ensembles in band competitions and was composed by Naoki Tasaka.Since the anime adaption of \"Sound! Euphonium \" was released following the timeline of the real-time competition, the band was shown performing the same piece that hundreds of other high school bands in Japan were rehearsing in real life.The official list of the required piece for the All Japan Band Competition 2015 is as follows:  I. :  II. :  III. : : Appears in the anime.

It begins in Spain, and features intense Spanish-styled music, before transitioning to a much sweeter melody as the wind reaches the city of Provence in southern France. It picks up pace once again in a grandiose fanfare as the wind returns to whence it came.\"Wind of Provence\" begins with an Appassionato \u2669= 132 in D minor, featuring a melody in trumpets and alto saxophones, joined by runs in the flutes, clarinets, oboe, and xylophone. It quickly shifts to a clarinet melody before partially repeating the first section. The piece introduces another new theme, before transitioning to a tenor and bass range melody. Following this is an oboe and euphonium duet, before the tenor-bass melody repeats. The piece repeats its prior two themes before slowing down slightly and shifting tones. Now, the piece is written as Dolcemente in B\u266d major. It features a trio between the alto saxophones, tenor saxophones, and euphonium, gradually gaining more instruments in this melody until it reaches a climax. The flutes, trumpets, and clarinets take over while the saxophones and horns introduce a new countermelody. This gently calms down, only for the song to abruptly shift into a fanfare led by the trumpets, putting a new variation on the melody previously heard in the Dolcemente section.

The bars are not perfectly rectangular; instead, on the underside they are arched inwards, which is necessary to tune the bars. Beneath the bars are pipes of corresponding lengths which amplify the sound. It is very similar to a xylophone, but is much larger and the bars are thinner.Marimbas exist in many different sizes depending on the range and register desired. The standard is anywhere between 4 and 5 octaves, but some have more, and the octaves may fall between different pitches.Performance.The characteristic tone of the marimba is largely attributed to the type of mallet used. The most practical and common mallet material used is yarn. This provides the familiar warm, rich tone of the marimba, compared to the xylophone which sounds much brighter as it uses acrylic mallets.Players must be familiar with how to hold mallets and perform a variety of techniques using them, including tremolo. Marimba parts often call for difficult runs and passages, so players are required to be quite dexterous. The marimbist also frequently must use more than two mallets, up to four, which can prove challenging.Scoring.Marimbas are used in concert bands, symphony orchestras, jazz bands, and marching bands. In concert bands and wind ensembles, marimba parts are usually written as a portion of a greater Percussion 1, 2, 3, etc. part. As for marching bands, marimbas can either be a part of the front ensemble, or be carried as a marching marimba.As portrayed in \"Sound!

He dresses in clothing described as \"gaudy\" and \"flashy,\" and is a head shorter than Taki. He is always seen wearing large blue glasses, a faux-leather and gold watch, thin metal bracelets, and a yellow cord necklace.Hashimoto has also been seen wearing hot pink shirts, bright yellow shirts, red shirts with strange patterns, and various Hawaiian shirts. In college, he wore a letterman jacket and had longer hair than in the present.Manga.Hashimoto is much shorter than Noboru Taki and he is sturdy-built. He has short blond hair and light blue eyes. In the fall and winter, Hashimoto wears shirts with blazers and pants. In the summer, and sometimes in the fall, he wears athletic polo shirts, sports pants that are rolled up mid-calf length, and tennis shoes.Personality.Hashimoto is a fun-loving, athletic, and humorous man who is consequently highly popular with his percussion students. Like Kumiko Oumae, Hashimoto sometimes accidentally blurts out things. He is somewhat odd, often saying \"Hrm?\" and even asking his students to call him \"Hashimo-chan\". He has also repeatedly offered to share details with students concerning Noboru Taki's wayward misbehavior in college, to Taki's annoyance.Despite his quirkiness, however, Hashimoto is just as strict and demanding with his percussion students as both Taki and Satomi Niiyama. In the light novels, Hashimoto shocks his students on his first sectional with the high expectations he sets for them, similar to the first impression that Taki left the concert band on his first day.Hashimoto proves to be keenly observant and quickly picks up on the social and emotional dynamics of the ensemble and of individual students, which Taki is often blinded to. In addition, Hashimoto seems caring for all the students in the concert band beyond his own percussion students.Chronology.Season Two.In the first episode, Hashimoto introduces himself to the Kitauji Concert Band as \"Hashimo-chan\". He offers to spill secrets about Noboru Taki's college life, and begins rambling until Taki cuts him short by stomping on his foot.In the second episode, Hashimoto purposely sneezes right as Taki is reminding his students not to get sick.In the third episode, Hashimoto calls Mizore Yoroizuka's playing \"robotic\" and attempts to motivate her to play with more passion by delivering a monologue in front of the band. He states that the only thing limiting the band from reaching their full potential is their need for expressive playing. Later in the evening, Hashimoto has a personal conversation with Kumiko Oumae. Afterward, it is revealed that he went and apologized to Taki for oversharing in his conversation with Kumiko.In the fourth episode, Hashimoto reminds the band not to worry just because their performance number is right after a highly competitive school.After the award ceremony at nationals, Hashimoto congratulates Taki on a great performance, then makes Taki pay for ramen for the two of them. Then they yell at each other about which kind of ramen broth tastes better.Relationships.Satomi Niiyama.Niiyama and Hashimoto are currently colleagues and were good friends in college. Along with Taki and his girlfriend at the time, who later became his wife, the four of them were a tightly knit clique. In college, Niiyama was a grade younger than Taki and Hashimoto, so they always saw her as a little sister of sorts.Noboru Taki.Taki and Hashimoto were in the same year of college. They were best friends and constantly got into mischief together, though Hashimoto later conceded that Taki was always the more attractive among the pair and was the \"girl-magnet\" in their collegiate concert band.Taki and Hashimoto share a playful dynamic. When together, they constantly exchange lighthearted jokes and sarcastic banter. Hashimoto's loud, brash humor often complements Taki's subtler deadpan remarks. The fact that Hashimoto's mere presence draws forth a brighter side of Taki's personality does not go unnoticed by the students in the Kitauji Concert Band. Kumiko remarks in the light novel that she had never seen Taki in such high spirits before Hashimoto's debut.Prior to the events of \"Hibike! Euphonium\", Taki distanced himself from all his friends and family, including Hashimoto, after the death of Chihiro Taki. Hashimoto was hurt and worried, and felt helpless as Taki drowned himself in grief. The two did not regain contact for years until Taki asked Hashimoto to help direct the band at Kitauji. Hashimoto says in the light novels that he was so relieved and happy that Taki had reconnected himself with his friends and his love of music that he almost cried, finally seeing his best friend smile again after years of sadness.During a \"Hibike! Euphonium\" seiyuu event, it was revealed that Hashimoto and Taki had a ridiculous shouting match over which kind of ramen broth was better. It was described by Kumiko Oumae as \"a childish argument\".Kumiko Oumae.Although Kumiko is not a percussionist and thus not strictly speaking one of Hashimoto's students, Hashimoto is still friendly to her and cares for both her and Reina. Concerned about Reina's evident feelings for Taki, Hashimoto approaches Kumiko to make sure that Reina isn't overstepping any boundaries. In the subsequent conversation, Hashimoto accidentally reveals to Kumiko that Taki is single, widowed, and still grieving. The name Masahiro means \"real, genuine\" (\u771f) (masa) and \"command, esteem\" (\u535a) (hiro). Masahiro's surname Hashimoto means \"bridge\" (\u6a4b) (hashi) and \"base, root, origin, source\" (\u672c) (moto). Hashimoto's original design in the manga was changed by Kyoto Animation as a shoutout to Yuuichi Nakamura (Hashimoto's seiyuu). Nakamura is an extremely famous seiyuu playing an extremely small role, so the animators re-drew Hashimoto with Nakamura's five-o-clock shadow, rolled-up sleeves and necklaces. Hashimoto likes \"shio\" ramen."}

She likes practicing the oboe alone outside the classroom, and frequently arrives early to school, hours before the start of her classes, to practice. Mizore is the only student to arrive at school even earlier than Reina Kousaka.While she's very shy and introverted, she is a genuinely kind and loving individual. Furthermore, also due to her low self esteem, she hates being alone and tends to be dependent on others, with her dearest friend Nozomi wanting her to be more confident and independent, and believing in her as being naturally talented.Chronology.As a minor character in season one of the anime, Mizore had a very small role with no speaking lines. She was present as a cameo in several episodes, occasionally seen quietly playing her oboe.In the theater version, there is an additional scene where Mizore speaks with Yuuko, which takes place before Yuuko asks Reina to purposely lose in the audition.In season two, Mizore is revealed to have had a fallen friendship with former band member Nozomi Kasaki after the schism of the previous year. Nozomi now wishes to rejoin the band because of the new attitude of the ensemble under Noboru Taki's direction. Because of Mizore's extremely high value to the ensemble, due to her soloistic playing being a huge contributor to the band's overall success, Asuka Tanaka refuses to allow Nozomi to rejoin the band out of concern that Mizore will be emotionally compromised. However, due to an unexpected move by Nozomi to talk to Mizore causing her to run off, the latter managed to talk things out with Nozomi and restore their friendship. It is also revealed that Mizore played the oboe for the sole reason that it was the only thing that connected her with Nozomi.In \"Liz and the Blue Bird\", Mizore and Nozomi's friendship develops further. Mizore becomes less dependent on Nozomi and decides to go to a music school after graduating, while Nozomi decides to go to a regular university.In \"Sound! Euphonium: The Movie - Our Promise: A Brand New Day\", Mizore and Nozomi perform the flute and oboe duet in Liz and the Blue Bird.

However, when written in kanji (\u9719), it could possibly mean \"sleet\".\"Mizore\" may be a partial anagram of Nozomi Kasaki's name, with two of the three kana syllables matching: \"Mi-zo-\" \u2014 \"-zo-mi\". Mizore's surname Yoroizuka means \"armor\" (\u93a7) (yoroi) and \"mound, hill\/hillock, heap, knoll, pile, drift, stack, bank\" (\u585a) (tsuka\/zuka). According to the official \"Sound!

Her special skill is playing rhythm games, and she is strong at playing strategy games. Mizore marched with pom-poms during SunFes, as oboes are not marching instruments. Mizore doesn't speak at all in the first season of the anime. According to the interview in the theater pamphlet, they said they didn't want to make her speak because the second season wasn't confirmed at that time. Despite Mizore's lack of meaningful role in the first season, she appears in many official artworks and brief movie frames as some sort of hint for season 2. Mizore, Nozomi Kasaki, Natsuki Nakagawa and Yuuko Yoshikawa graduated from Minami Junior High School. There is an additional scene in the theater version where Mizore talks with Yuuko, but her VA is uncredited (which is now revealed to be Atsumi Tanezaki). Based on the scrape patterns on her reed in the first episode of the second season, it can be seen that Mizore plays on the short-scrape style reeds common to European players. Mizore's oboe playing has been praised by Noboru Taki as always being perfectly in tune, but Masahiro Hashimoto has commented that it lacks emotion, yet he notices how her musical expression changes when Nozomi returns. Additionally, Mizore can play a little bit of piano as shown in Liz and the Blue Bird. According to the, she had to learn how to play the piano for her exam. Mizore likes soda-flavored sweets and carbonated juice, while she dislikes places with poor radio signals.Mizore Yoroizuka on Hibike! Euphonium Archive"}

It is later revealed that the second-years are like this because of an event which occurred the year before Kumiko Oumae's first year at Kitauji.However, Natsuki is a kind girl who's normally friendly to everyone, and tends to be mature and calm in most situations. She is also understanding of situations and takes everything quite nicely. The name Natsuki means \"summer\" (\u590f) (natsu) and \"chronicle\" (\u7d00) (ki). Natsuki's surname Nakagawa means \"middle\" (\u4e2d) (naka) and \"river, stream\" (\u5ddd) (kawa\/gawa). Natsuki Nakagawa's and Yuuko Yoshikawa's surnames seem to contain a curious wordplay: if written together in kana, their first kanji (\u4e2d and \u5409) form \"nakayoshi\", which means \"(having a) good relationship\"; at the same time, they both share the second kanji for \"river\" (\u5ddd). Natsuki and Yuuko Yoshikawa often get into playful arguments and teasing, much to the amusement of others, particularly Kumiko Oumae. Natsuki did not pass her first audition. Natsuki, Yuuko, Nozomi Kasaki and Mizore Yoroizuka graduated from Minami Junior High School. Natsuki joined the band because of Nozomi, as she admires her. Natsuki has short hair in the novel and manga. Natsuki used to not have any illustration in the novel, so her appearance in the anime was completely redesigned. Character designer Shouko Ikeda said that Natsuki looks awful with her short hair like in the novel, so she made her hair a bit longer and put it in a ponytail, so she would look cuter. Natsuki's illustration is revealed on the cover of the, which shows that her appearance in the novel is now the same as in the anime. Natsuki becomes the band's vice president in her senior year. According to the official \"Sound! Euphonium\" novel website: Her favorite colors are purple and black. Her special skill is being able to perform fast calculations, while still being poor at math. She likes bears and spicy food, and dislikes matcha and anko (red-bean paste). In the novels, Natsuki's euphonium case has a yellow, faded bear charm key-chain on it. Natsuki's euphonium is based on a Yamaha YEP-321 model. Natsuki plays electric guitar in \"Our Promise: A Brand New Day\".

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2215","text":"Noboru Taki is the recurring secondary character of \"Sound! Euphonium\" series.He is the son of Tooru Taki, the widowed husband of Chihiro Taki, and a new general music teacher at Kitauji High School at which he substitutes for Rikako-sensei (in the light novels), and is the permanent instructor (in the animated series.) Taki serves as the Kitauji High School Concert Band's director during afterschool hours and is in charge of class 2-5 (second years, class 5).Appearance.Anime.Taki is considered an attractive man because of his unkempt dark hair, deep-blue eyes and slim form. He is popular among the school's girls because of his good looks, and he is quite tall as his height surpasses Takuya Gotou's height, the tallest student in the band.Taki always wears high-brow half-rimmed glasses. In the fall and winter, he likes to wear cardigans (usually gray, sometimes brown) over button-up shirts, sometimes with a long dark coat. In the summer, he wears short-sleeved button-ups under sleeveless sweaters and khaki pants. At band camp, Taki is seen wearing various striped polo shirts, untucked. During college flashbacks, Taki is seen wearing jeans and a hoodie.Manga.In the manga, Taki's hair is not as messy as it is in the anime. It is drawn as brown in color instead of black.In the fall and winter, he dresses in shirts without ties, leaves the top button unfastened, and wears blazers (usually dark blue) and khaki pants. In the summer, he wears short-sleeved shirts with khaki pants.Personality.In school, Taki is usually polite and soft-spoken, and overall very friendly. He is rarely angry or upset unless under heavy stress. However, the students quickly find that under his gentle semblance is a highly demanding and often bluntly critical teacher with a methodical personality. Many upperclassmen who remained from the schism were accustomed to the passive mindset of the band from previous years and initially disliked Taki's methods. Despite this, Taki slowly earns his students' respect as everyone realizes that he is serious about going to the nationals.Outside of the classroom, Taki is a different person, revealing a friendlier personality. His demeanor is gentler, quieter, and somewhat more melancholy when he is not in front of the band. When occasionally in a positive mood, Taki exhibits quirky, bizarre social behavior, can be easily distracted, and becomes awkwardly hyperactive when he gets overly excited about something.Both at work and at home, Taki is wholeheartedly dedicated to music and music education. He is one of the first teachers to arrive at school in the morning, and often stays late at night working in the faculty office. In his spare time, he listens to various middle and high school band performances on his phone or laptop, assessing and studying the recordings to improve his own teaching methods.When it comes to music, Taki is as unrelenting on himself as he is toward his students, if not harsher. He is prone to self-blame and tends to set unreasonably high standards for himself, likely due to the high expectations his father set for him as a child.Although Taki is now a polite and professional adult, it was revealed in the light novels that he used to be rather rude, cheeky, and rebellious in his teens and twenties. After experiencing a personal tragedy, he underwent a period of severe grieving and reemerged having lost much of his former childish personality.Background.Taki played the horn in elementary school, but he switched to trombone in middle school. At an early age, he dreamed of many wild careers, including pottery, manga drawing and film directing.In college, Taki majored in trombone performance at a music college, but stated that he realized he was not cut out to be a performer and might fare better as a teacher. After graduation, he taught general music at a public school for a few years without directing his school's band, although he did visit occasionally to help out and give advice. He temporarily stopped teaching at the age of 29, and did not return to the music profession until 5 years later, which is when the story of \"Hibike! Euphonium\" begins.Chihiro Taki was also a music teacher who was an alumnus of Kitauji High School's band under Taki's father's direction. The two of them met in their college wind band, and fell in love through music. The couple lived happily for several years, but never had children. Chihiro became terminally ill early in their marriage, passing away when her husband was 29, five years before the events of \"Hibike! Euphonium\" that he is currently a widower.After her death, Taki suffered from crippling grief for years. During this time, he quit his job and cut off contact with nearly everyone in his life. It is unknown how Taki earned his livelihood during these years. He almost entirely abandoned music, being described in the novels as unable to look at musical instruments or sheet music without crying. Despite this, Taki eventually decided to dedicate his life to fulfilling his wife's unachieved dream of taking Kitauji (her alma mater) to gold at the All-Japan band competition.In addition, because Taki is a temporary substitute for Rikako, who is on maternity leave, he has a time limit of one year to take his wife's alma mater to gold at nationals. This is the main reason he pushes his students extremely hard at first, but as the events of the \"Hibike! Euphonium\" light novels unfold, Taki grows to truly care about his students and begins to act more in their interest than for his own ends. This may have resulted in the band's low score at nationals, compared to their previous stunning performances.However, in the anime, Taki is implied to be a permanent teacher instead of a substitute and he therefore has more chances in the future to take Kitauji to Nationals.Rehearsal Method.Taki states on his first day with the concert band that he bases his teaching methods on his value of student initiative. He also pushes strongly for the students to align their spoken principles with their actual behaviors, and to hold themselves to a higher standard of integrity and self-examination. To this end, Taki enforces a merit-based seating system decided by audition rather than the previous system based on seniority.Although he is undoubtedly an intuitive, effective, and talented teacher, Taki can sometimes be too harsh in rehearsals with his blunt criticisms and biting word choice. However, when students do not perform up to standard in rehearsals, Taki gives them the control over what kind of deadlines and goals they will set for themselves to improve their playing, unlike many other band directors.Oddly, Taki prefers to conduct with his hands instead of a baton, which is extremely unusual for any band or orchestra conductor. He reportedly chooses not to use one because his deceased wife preferred not to use them, and he adopted her conducting style as a tribute to her life. However, in the manga, Taki is very clearly seen conducting with a baton.There is a common misconception that Taki's rehearsal tactics are \"non-traditional\" or \"unorthodox.\" However, the strategies, philosophies, and exercises that Taki employs when teaching the band are considered quite standard in both American and Japanese bands. It is in fact the Kitauji Concert Band that is not orthodox in their lax procedures, which were encouraged by Rikako prior to Taki's arrival.Taki majored in trombone in college, and has years of experience with horn and other brass instruments. This makes him an excellent brass instructor but he is unconsciously biased in favor of listening for brass parts when providing critique in rehearsal, since that is his natural tendency as a low brass player. Taki is aware of this fault, and in the second trimester, he seeks to balance the attention that his students receive by hiring Satomi Niiyama (a woodwind specialist) and Masahiro Hashimoto (a percussion specialist).Chronology.Taki first appears in Episode 1, listening to band music on his phone at a local shrine.In Episode 6, Taki introduces placement auditions for the first time in the band, which shocks and offends many members because the results will override seniority with musical proficiency. Although it forces everyone to practice harder, many students accuse Taki of bias, particularly concerning his affiliation with Reina Kousaka prior to teaching at Kitauji. At Michie Matsumoto's suggestion, Taki then holds a public re-audition, allowing the students to hear Reina's stellar playing firsthand and judge the results for themselves.In Episode 8, Taki is enjoying himself at the Agata Festival together with Michie, who is terrorizing her students with school dress code rules. Taki mentions to Kumiko Oumae in Episode 12 that he was yelled at by the vice principal for making the students practice too hard. He also gives her some vague personal reasons for why he chose to teach concert band.In Episode 13, Taki is seen in the staff room before the final concert, speaking to a photo of his late wife.In the second season, Taki brings in two friends from college named Masahiro Hashimoto and Satomi Niiyama to help him direct the band and prepare them for the next two rounds of competition.Later, Akemi Tanaka brings Asuka Tanaka to Taki's office and tries to demand that he give Asuka permission to quit the band. However, Taki senses that Asuka is being forced against her will and tells her mother that he will not do anything that is against his students' deepest will, assuring Asuka that he forbids her to quit. At the end of the third light novel, after the band fails to win gold at nationals, Taki nearly has a breakdown because he is aware that he will likely never have another chance to work with the Kitauji concert band once Rikako-sensei returns to her post.At the end of the anime's second season, Taki is shown speaking to Michie about preparing to teach the band next year, implying he is not a substitute teacher, unlike his novel characterization. The name Noboru means \"rise\" (\u6607). Noboru's surname Taki means \"waterfall, cascade, watering place\" (\u6edd). Like Tooru Taki, Taki has a perfect pitch. Taki can get \"way\" too excited about kichi. On the anniversary of Chihiro Taki's death, Taki wears his wedding ring to class. The white flower hairpin that Taki gave his wife before proposing to her is a recurring symbol that appears in the manga and anime. For some reason, Taki always keeps the top button on his shirts fastened. Taki gets to school extremely early every morning, and leaves extremely late at night. He leaves his office only to sleep, buy pre-packaged food, or pray for his wife at a shrine. In the book, Taki is noted to have really good handwriting. Taki prefers \"shoyu\" ramen over \"shio\" ramen. Taki likes coffee milk, sandwiches, pickles, tea and \"\", while he dislikes black vinegar and cinnamon cookie dough.Noboru Taki on Hibike!

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=4948","text":"Noboru Taki\/RelationshipsRelationships.Teachers.Michie Matsumoto.Michie Matsumoto is Taki's colleague and assistant director, and taught at Kitauji while Taki's father, Tooru Taki, taught the band before his son. She is Taki's friend and sometimes mentor. Michie and Taki often spend time together after school in the staff room, and they went to the Agata Festival together. Michie also sometimes gives Taki helpful but subtle advice.Masahiro Hashimoto.Taki hired Hashimoto as a percussion instructor to help his students on the path to nationals. The two of them were best friends in college and constantly got into mischief together, though Hashimoto later conceded that Taki was always the more attractive among the pair.Taki and Hashimoto share a playful dynamic. When together, they constantly exchange lighthearted jokes and deadpan banter. Hashimoto's loud, brash humor often complements Taki's subtler deadpan remarks. The fact that Hashimoto's mere presence draws forth a brighter side of Taki's personality does not go unnoticed by the students in the Kitauji Concert Band. Kumiko remarks in the light novel that she had never seen Taki in such high spirits prior to Hashimoto's debut.Prior to the events of \"Hibike! Euphonium, \"Taki distanced himself from all his friends and family, including Hashimoto, after the death of his wife. Hashimoto was hurt and worried, and felt helpless as Taki drowned himself in grief. The two did not regain contact for years until Taki asked Hashimoto to help direct the band at Kitauji. Hashimoto said that he was so relieved and happy that Taki had reconnected himself with music that he almost cried, finally seeing his best friend smile again after years of sadness.During a \"Hibike! Euphonium\" seiyuu event, it was revealed that Taki and Hashimoto had a shouting match over which kind of ramen broth was better. It was described by Oumae Kumiko as \"a childish argument.\"Satomi Niiyama.Taki hired Niiyama as a woodwind instructor to help his students on the path to nationals. The two of them, along with Masahiro Hashimoto, were good friends in college. Niiyama was a grade younger than Taki and Hashimoto, whom both saw her as a little sister of sorts. Though she is now married, she occasionally flirts with Taki just for fun, but without any serious intent. However, this leads most of the band to suspect her for a while of being Taki's girlfriend, until Hashimoto reveals that she is already married.Students.Reina Kousaka.Taki and his family knew Reina and her father, a famous trumpet player, before Reina's enrollment at Kitauji. In fact, their fathers were co-directors for the Kitauji Concert Band for many years. Taki's sister and Reina also knew each other a very long time, so Taki had known Reina since he was a teenager. It is mentioned in the novels that younger Taki used to cheer up Reina when she was a very young child by playing music with her.In the manga and light novels, Reina has an early morning ritual of visiting Taki's office, hours before classes start, with the excuse of asking Taki for the keys to the band room to practice. Even though she knows that the band room is usually unlocked because Mizore Yoroizuka tends to arrive even earlier, Reina always drops by anyway just to say good morning.Later in the novels and anime, Reina confesses to Taki that she loves him after the final concert when all the bands\/mentors are being honored, but he misunderstands her intent and takes it as a sign of respect and thankfulness rather than romantic interest.Kumiko Oumae.Taki was seen at first by Kumiko as very strict about practicing and going to the nationals, but Kumiko later realizes that it is all to help the band progress as fast as possible. She respects him and believes he is a good teacher.When Taki cuts Kumiko from a euphonium part in Crescent Moon Dance, he does it as respectfully as he can, without mentioning her name. Later, he offers a second chance to be given to her for the second round of competition, and reminds her to practice hard.Taki takes notice when Kumiko begins to practice harder, and, like he does with other students, encourages her. In the second light novel, and only in the novel, Taki buys Kumiko and Mizore Yoroizuka each a bottle of sweet green tea when he finds them practicing in the school building late in the evening.In the anime, and only in the anime, Taki drives Kumiko home on a stormy night, during which he shares part of his wife's story with her. When her umbrella is destroyed by the typhoon winds, he gives her his own.In the light novel, after Taki fails to reach his own goals of having the band secure a gold award at nationals, he comes close to a breakdown in his office, shaking all over, and tells Kumiko the full story of his wife and the promise he made to her. Kumiko consoles him with a few words, and he thanks her, seeming to feel slightly better. In the anime, this scene was moved to before the competition, and the show creators included Reina in the interaction as well.Family.Tooru Taki.\"Taki:\" \"My father was the adviser [of Kitauji's band] at the time. Apparently they made it to the Nationals.\"\"Kumiko: \"'Apparently?'\"\"\"Taki:\" \"I was rebellious back then.\"Taki had a strained relationship with his father, a famous band director who formerly taught at Kitauji. The austere manner in which Taki's father raised his children may be responsible for his son's penchant of speaking harshly to his students, as it is the only way he knows how to express affection. In fact, the relationship between father and son was so poor that Taki entirely avoided the band at the school he previously taught at, because he associated the act of conducting a band with his father. It was due to this that Taki never taught any bands before Kitauji, even though he had taught general music for many years and was well-equipped to teach a high school band.In the anime, Taki reveals to Kumiko that as a teenager, he was barely aware that Kitauji had made it to Nationals. When Kumiko seems surprised that Taki knows so little about his own father's achievements, Taki's answer-- that he was \"rebellious\"-- indicates the state of their relationship.Despite all this, when Taki quit his job and almost entirely abandoned music due to personal tragedy, it was his father who talked him into returning to teaching music, and into teaching band at Kitauji."}

In the light novels, it is mentioned that Minami's band program is famous for its excellent flute section, which has remained the strongest and most outstanding section in the band for many years. Kumiko Oumae is one of many fascinated with their sound, and often listens to recordings of Minami's performances just to listen to their flute section. When Nozomi practices flute on Kitauji High School's overpass, Kumiko recognizes the distinctive sound as belonging to a Minami flautist.Chronology.Nozomi is first seen in a flashback in Episode 7 when Natsuki Nakagawa explains to Kumiko Oumae and her friends about the schism in the previous year.Nozomi comes to watch the Kitauji Concert Band's performance in the final episode.At the start of Season 2, Nozomi tried to rejoin the band as well as get Asuka Tanaka's approval. However, Asuka initially rejected due to the fear of Mizore Yoroizuka possibly being affected by Nozomi's sudden return, causing a negative impact on Mizore's performance for the competition. However, due to an unexpected move by Nozomi to talk to Mizore causing her to run off, the latter managed to talk things out with Nozomi and restore their friendship. It is also revealed that Mizore played the oboe for the sole reason that it was the only thing that connected her with Nozomi.In \"Liz and the Blue Bird\", Mizore and Nozomi's relationship develops further. Mizore becomes less dependent on Nozomi and decides to go to a music school after graduating, while Nozomi decides to go to a regular university.In \"Sound!

In Episode 4 of Season 2, Mizore was finally able to muster up the courage to talk to Nozomi and restore their friendship.In \"Liz and the Blue Bird\", Mizore realises the full extent of their friendship, ultimately confessing and calling Nozomi her \"everything\". Mizore also becomes less dependent on Nozomi, but their relationship deepens into an unbreakable friendship.Although the relationship between the two girls is formally described as friendship in most official sources, in interviews dedicated to the film, Naoko Yamada repeatedly noted that the filmmakers did not intend to simply portray Mizore and Nozomi\u2019s bond as either \u201cvery good friends\u201d or a \u201clove story\u201d, instead preferring to represent the complex teenage experience, which the viewer can evaluate for themself by observing the \u201csincere behavior\u201d of the characters.Natsuki Nakagawa.Nozomi is the person that Natsuki admires (similar to how Kumiko sees Reina) and Nozomi is one of the reasons why Natsuki decided to join the band in high school.

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3920","text":"Oboe is a instrument in the . A musician who plays the oboe is called an \"oboist\" or simply an \"oboe player.\"Construction.The oboe is usually made out of plastic or wood. It is divided into three sections, the upper and lower joints, which contain the instrument's silver keys, and the bell. In addition, the oboe makes its sound via a double reed inserted in the top of the instrument, usually made out of bamboo.The reed is key to making sound on the instrument. Most oboists learn to make their own reeds, as they must be replaced often, and are usually expensive and of substandard quality when store bought.Variants.When the term oboe is used alone, it generally means the standard C oboe rather than other instruments of the family.English Horn.The \"English horn\", or \"cor Anglais\" is a transposing instrument in the oboe family pitched in F, therefore a perfect fifth below the C oboe. It is a larger version of the oboe, and uses a bocal like a bassoon. It is a standard member in symphony orchestras, but rarely used in concert bands as most literature does not call for it. It is considered the alto voice of the oboe family.Oboe d'Amore.The \"oboe d'amore\" is a transposing instrument in the oboe family pitched in A, therefore a minor third below the C oboe. It is occasionally called for in symphony orchestras, but it is not a standard member. It is considered the mezzo-soprano voice of the oboe family.Baritone Oboe (Bass Oboe)\/Heckelphone\/Lupophon.The \"baritone oboe\" or \"bass oboe\" is a transposing instrument in the oboe family pitched in C, notated one octave above the sounding pitch. It is an octave below the standard C oboe. It is exceptionally rare and almost never called for in any literature.The \"heckelphone\" is a variant of the bass oboe, but its fingering is more like a bassoon, as well as using a bassoon style reed. As such, the instrument is most often played by bassoonists rather than oboists. The instrument descends to a low A. It is also very rare and not used much in any literature (although Richard Strauss called for it in some of his greatest works).The \"lupophon\" is a version of the bass oboe which goes down to a low F. It is a fairly modern invention, and only manufactured by one company, meaning it is extremely rare. The instrument was made to handle the extremely low notes that Richard Strauss wrote in \"Eine Alpensinfonie\", which would have been unplayable on the heckelphone at that time. It is essentially a modified heckelphone, and is often used in place of it.Performance.The pitch of the regular oboe is affected by the way in which the reed is constructed, which has a significant effect on the sound of the instrument.Orchestras normally tune to a concert A played by the oboe, since the pitch of the oboe is secure and its penetrating sound makes it ideal for tuning purposes. However, in most concert bands, the pitch is given by the principal B\u266d clarinet, as the Kitauji High School Concert Band does.The oboe is largely considered the most difficult woodwind instrument to play, especially since it is not easily transferable from other instruments as it uses a double reed. Since it plays such an important role in tuning the band, playing the oboe can be a big responsibility. The instrument is very difficult to master, and can take many years to get a good tone.The instrument has a very distinct, yet versatile tone. Oboes can blend very well with the rest of the ensemble, or be heard above everyone else as a soloist.Scoring.Oboes are used primarily in symphony orchestras and concert bands. They are never used in marching bands for a variety of reasons. Oboists will normally become guard members or double on another instrument during marching season.In symphony orchestras, the principal oboe is the de facto leader of the woodwind section. There is usually 2-3 oboes, and 1-2 English horns in the orchestra.A concert band usually has one or two oboe players, although some bands may have up to three or even four. One or two of these players may double on English horn when necessary, although the Kitauji Concert Band does not perform any repertoire that requires an English horn.In young school bands, teachers do not typically allow students to start directly on oboe lessons because of the instrument's difficulty. Most oboists in school bands begin on clarinet or flute in elementary or middle school before switching to oboe after a year or two on an easier instrument.As portrayed in \"Hibike! Euphonium\".Mizore Yoroizuka is the only oboist in the Kitauji Concert Band and is shown to be an excellent player, as well as being able to make her own reeds. In \", she is the double reeds section leader.In \", another oboist, Ririka Kenzaki, joins the ensemble. In \"Sound! Euphonium 3\", she is the double reeds section leader as no third year is in that section.In Rikka High School Marching Band, there is an oboist named Mion Saijou. Mizore's oboe is based on Yamaha YOB-432 model. Ririka's oboe is probably based on Yamaha YOB-421 or YOB-431 model."}

The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments, following the human voice. Percussionists are required to play multiple instruments in the orchestra or band, unlike other players who are limited to one instrument each. Being a percussionist is a highly respected job and is in charge of providing guidance and timing to the rest of the band. Hence, without percussion, the band is unable to function well. "}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3946","text":"Piccolo is an instrument in the flute family, and by extension the family of musical instruments. It is half the size of a standard C flute. Someone who plays the piccolo is called a piccoloist.Construction.Like the flute, the piccolo is usually made out of metal and has a head joint, which contains the lip plate and hole which the musician blows across, and a body joint, which contains the instrument's keys. However, unlike the flute, most professional instruments are made out of wood, as portrayed in \"Hibike! Euphonium\".Variants.The vast majority of piccolos are in C, but a tiny fraction are pitched in D\u266d. Manufactured in the early 20th century, these instruments are no longer produced, and are most famously used for John Philip Sousa's \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" piccolo solo.Performance.The modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings and techniques as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but being half-sized and therefore pitched up an octave, the instrument is much harder to play.Because of the piccolo's incredibly high range, it is often playing an octave or more above every other member of the band (Except potentially the glockenspiel). This means piccolo players can be very easily picked out from even the largest of ensembles, and as such their parts must be perfected. To make matters more difficult for the piccoloist, the upper register of the instrument is much more bright and loud, making it even harder to blend.Due to all the difficulties involved in playing the piccolo, someone who wants to play the piccolo will likely need at least a few year's experience and proficiency on the flute.Scoring.Despite being pitched in C, the piccolo is a transposing instrument. This is because the music for it will read exactly the same as a flute, but it will sound an octave higher.The instrument is most commonly used in wind ensembles, symphony orchestras, or marching bands.In orchestral settings, the piccolo player is often designated as \"piccolo\/flute III\", or even \"assistant principal\". Most orchestras have designated this position as a solo position due to the demands of the literature. Piccolos are often orchestrated to double the violins or the flutes, adding sparkle and brilliance to the overall sound because of the aforementioned one-octave transposition upwards.In concert band and marching bands, the piccolo will usually get its own part, though sometimes it is not available and thus doubles a flute part. In more advanced literature, piccolos often receive challenging solos. In a concert band, there is usually only 1 piccolo player, but marching bands may have several more.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".Yoriko Souga, the band's librarian, is the only piccolo player in the Kitauji High School Concert Band, and she seems to be quite adept at it. She plays the piccolo in their Nationals performance, but also interchanges with playing the flute for other pieces. In, Sari Takahashi switches from playing the flute to the piccolo.In Sound! Euphonium 3, Tsumiki Yamane switches from playing the flute to the piccolo."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=8251","text":"Polovtsian Dances, or Polovetsian Dances is a piece composed by as the end of act 2 of his opera \"\". The piece was later made into an arrangement for concert band, and was played by Minami Junior High School's concert band as their free-choice piece in the All-Japan Band Competition.Scoring.The piece, in 4\/4, begins with a slow, sweet melody lead by the oboe, flute, and clarinet, carried by repeating half-notes in the horn and harp. It moves to the piece's famous oboe solo, played by Mizore Yoroizuka, shortly after handed to the alto saxophone in place of the original English horn. Succeeding these, the flutes pick up the same melody as the oboe, while the basses provide a stronger foundation. The section eventually comes to a close featuring a short oboe solo. This part of the piece is heard in the main series of \"Hibike! Euphonium\".The tone then shifts, now much faster and intense. The section begins with trombones and other low instruments establish a bass line, shortly before a difficult clarinet solo takes the lead. Following this, the piccolo and flute repeat the same melody in a call-and-response, while the horns establish a countermelody. Clarinets and saxophones then take on the melody, while the flutes play the horn's countermelody, then flutes join the clarinets in the melody, while the trombones bring on a bright, loud countermelody. The section suddenly shifts to a more muted tone, and features a call-and-response between multiple parts, still featuring the same melody, eventually building up to the end of the section as a whole.Now in 3\/4, the section begins with a short timpani solo that quickly builds in volume, before exploding into a high energy full-ensemble melody minus basses, which, alongside bass drum and timpani, provide an accented note on the first beat of each bar. This is shortly followed by a soprano-range melody with a sustained chord in other parts. This section repeats itself. It is followed by a melody shared by saxophones, bass clarinet, and bassoon, before repeating the first two sections twice. The section is then quieted, though a suspenseful atmosphere remains, as a variety on the section's main theme is played. This part goes on for some time until repeating the first part of the section, though altered near its end as the section as a whole reaches its conclusion.Switching to 6\/8, the section enters with a short, repeating line in various instruments, continuing while the trombone and bassoon introduce another short, repeating part. The clarinets, flutes, oboe, and piccolo enter a call-and-response before several instruments begin downward runs as the tension builds up, eventually exploding similarly to the previous section. This high intensity is maintained through several melodies in different instruments. It eventually returns to the section's original introduction, this time in a different key and different instruments playing different parts. Shortly after, variations on melodies in the second part are heard, gradually quieting down, until reverting to the oboe's solo in the first section of the piece, played on flute, and afterward the alto saxophone solo. The piece continues like in the first section, but it includes parts heard in the introduction of the fourth section's call-and-response intro on top of the main melody, creating a sort of amalgamation.The section slows down gradually, until transitioning into the introduction of the fourth section, once again building up to an explosion. Variations on the fourth section's preceding melodies are introduced, following the same general pattern. Suddenly, the piece transitions to the melody of the second section at a much faster pace and in a different key. Succeeding this, an original melody is introduced, the piece now somewhat muted though still fast-paced. Gradually it gains volume as more layers are introduced, eventually transitioning to a section featuring the second section's melodies, before an intense finale to the piece.PiccoloFlute 1, 2E\u266d ClarinetB\u266d Clarinet 1, 2, 3E\u266d Alto ClarinetB\u266d Bass ClarinetE\u266d Alto Saxophone 1, 2B\u266d Tenor SaxophoneE\u266d Baritone SaxophoneB\u266d Trumpet 1, 2, 3F Horn 1, 2, 3, 4Trombone 1, 2, 3EuphoniumTubaDouble BassHarpTimpaniSnare DrumBass DrumCrash CymbalsTriangleTambourine"}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2157","text":"Reina Kousaka is one of the main characters of \"Sound! Euphonium\" series. She is a first-year trumpet player who plays in the Kitauji High School Concert Band, continuing on the same instrument from elementary and middle school. She was also a member of the concert band club at the same junior high school as Kumiko Oumae.Appearance.Reina is a teenage girl with an average build and a considerably shorter height, described to be beautiful in the light novels with a light complexion. She has long, straight black hair which is about lower-back length, which she sometimes wears in a ponytail. She has two long strands of hair laid on her shoulders and two smaller strands framing her face and purple eyes. She is usually seen wearing a normal Kitauji High School uniform for first-year female students.Personality.Reina is a calm and quiet girl who is very individualistic and passionate about music. Although she has a polite manner, especially to her seniors, she is told that she is not taken so well by others because she usually wears a surly expression. She can be somewhat cold and upset with others when someone talks ill about Noboru Taki, whom she has a crush on for which people sometimes comment on her.Reina is portrayed as a somewhat mysterious girl who doesn't open up to people easily, which is why it is on the principle that she does not attempt to be friends with someone who doesn't interest her. She is at times standoffish and can often speak very bluntly when it comes to her pride as a musician. Because of this, she has had trouble making friends in the past. She appears to be distant and emotional, focusing solely on her drive to succeed.However, as Reina grows closer to Kumiko Oumae, she begins to let her guard down and a different, friendlier side of her personality is revealed. After becoming friends with Kumiko, she grows close to her and supports and cares for Kumiko deeply. She shares with Kumiko her intentions to become truly special, which is why she plays the trumpet. She claims that with her trumpet, she will become her own kind of special. She cherishes her trumpet dearly, which was given to her by her parents when she was a junior high school student.Throughout the series, Reina appears to grow more empathetic, as she apologizes in later episodes for her rude behavior for the first time on screen. Later in the series, Kumiko mentions that Reina has changed, as she is willing to become friends and interact more with other people such as Hazuki Katou and Midori.Background.Reina has been playing the trumpet since she was very young, and continues to do so at Kitauji High School.She went to the same middle school as Kumiko Oumae and was a member of her junior high school's concert band along with her. In their time in middle school, Kumiko noticed Reina crying that left the band slightly short of qualifying for the next round of advancement and believed her to be crying out of joy. However, Reina was actually dismayed that she had lost her last chance to go to the nationals as a middle school student. She then ran away sobbing when Kumiko asked her if they could really make it to Nationals, leaving her speechless and guilty.It is also known that Noboru Taki's family and Reina's family knew each other before the start of the series, so Taki-sensei has known Reina since she was little.Chronology.On Reina's first day at Kitauji High School, she decided to join the band to play the trumpet, which made Asuka Tanaka happy and she warmly welcomed her.However, since Kumiko Oumae (along with Hazuki Katou and Sapphire Kawashima) were present and heard her admission, Kumiko became very shocked to see Reina again, especially after the incident she had with her in junior high.Throughout the series, while Kumiko has been acting very awkward around Reina ever since meeting her again, Reina hasn't really acted in such a way. Following some events, Reina grows closer to Kumiko and they eventually become friends. With Kumiko by her side, her motivation to become a better trumpet player has increased. The name Reina means \"beautiful, lovey\" (\u9e97) (rei) and \"apple tree\" (\u5948) (na).  Reina's surname Kousaka means \"tall, high\" (\u9ad8) (kou) and \"slope, hill\" (\u5742) (saka). According to the official \"Sound! Euphonium\" novel website: Her favorite colors are blue and white.Her hobbies are watching movies by herself and going to concerts with her father.Her special skill is playing the trumpet and piano. She started piano at the age of five. In the light novel, Reina is the Representative for the entering students also known as Freshmen. In the light novel, Reina is known to have good grades and is a very good student. In the light novel, before giving her Representative speech, Reina and Kumiko Oumae meet eyes for a few seconds. Reina takes private trumpet lessons outside of rehearsals.Reina likes pasta, citrus juice while she dislikes .Additionally, Reina is also the instrument manager.Reina's trumpet is probably based on Yamaha YTR-6310Z model.Reina is determined to go to music school. Reina's father raises and sells fish."}
{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3124","text":"Reina Kousaka\/RelationshipsKitauji High School Concert Band.Kumiko Oumae.In a flashback to their time in middle school, the first episode shows Kumiko noticing Reina crying during the revelation of their middle school band's ranking-- a high placement that left the band slightly short of qualifying for the next round of advancement-- and believed her to be crying out of joy. However Reina was actually dismayed that she had lost her last chance to go to the nationals as a middle school student, she then ran away sobbing, leaving Kumiko speechless and guilty.Due to this incident, the two enter high school with an uncertain relationship. Kumiko tries several times to confront Reina about what had happened, but fails every time due to her own awkwardness while Reina simply reacts as her usual self. Eventually, after a few tentative conversations, they gradually grow closer and develop a deep bond, apparent in their mutual blushing and occasional embarrassment when they see each other.In episode 8, Kumiko accidentally invites Reina to attend the Agata Festival with her. Still wary of each other, both girls reluctantly follow through with the unexpected chain of events that ensue. However, as they start talking about various topics, they eventually move to a first-name basis by the end of the festival.With their friendship restored and stronger than before, Kumiko is probably the closest friend Reina has. They share a unique bond of trust, and have exchanged \"confessions of love.\" Kumiko also states that she will always stay by Reina's side when she would compete against Kaori, claiming that she \"wouldn't abandon [her], even if it costs [her] life.\"Kaori Nakaseko.Kaori is Reina's senior in the trumpet section. She is friendly to Reina because she is younger than her, and Reina returns her respectful attitude. They share a healthy and polite rivalry in the band.Yuuko Yoshikawa.Yuuko, a second-year trumpet player, harbors strong jealousy against Reina both because Reina outperforms the entire trumpet section and because Yuuko is jealous of Reina on behalf of Kaori, with whom she is obsessed. Yuuko sometimes expresses annoyance whenever Reina plays outside of rehearsal, but Reina still treats her with respect, knowing her own place as an underclassman.Teachers.Noboru Taki.Throughout the earlier episodes, there are hints that Reina has feelings for Taki, such as her unreasonable expression of frustration when Shuuichi mentions his disapproval of Taki-sensei to Kumiko. This is later confirmed when Reina confesses to Kumiko that she likes Taki in a romantic way.In the light novels, Reina has a daily early-morning ritual of visiting Taki's office first thing when she arrives at school, before practicing trumpet and then heading to her first class. She also finds any excuse at all to visit Taki's office, no matter how pointless.It is also revealed in the light novels that Taki's father, Tooru Taki, taught the band alongside Reina's father for many years at Kitauji. Taki's sister and Reina also knew each other a very long time, so Taki had known Reina since he was a teenager. The younger Taki used to cheer up Reina when she was a young child by playing music with her.In the light novels, when Reina meets Satomi Niiyama and suspects her to be Taki's girlfriend (later proven false), she smashes a drinking glass on the ground in rage. She begins to perform her solo during rehearsals with noticeably less emotion and sensitivity, causing Taki to grow concerned as the competition approaches. However, in the anime, Reina does neither of these.At the end of the third novel, Reina confesses to Taki that she loves him after the final concert while all the bands\/mentors are being honored. However, because of her choice to speak to him in this situation, Taki takes her words as a sign of respect from a student rather than of romantic interest. Despite knowing that her intentions were misunderstood, Reina smiles anyway, as observed by Kumiko, and seems content with his polite response.Reina later learns from Taki personally about his wife and her passing."}

Her full name is unknown and not mentioned in the light novels.Personality.Rikako is described as a kind and gentle woman, but she lacks motivation and passion. She was more concerned about whether or not the students in the band \"got along\" instead of their musical achievement and so encouraged the third years to assert power over their juniors.Chronology.Prior to the events of \"Hibike! Euphonium, \"Rikako took a relaxed approach to teaching the band, but her lax method and casual attitude clashed with the interests of a group of students, comprised of the former third years and the former first years (spearheaded by Nozomi Kasaki).

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=3258","text":"Saxophone (\u30b5\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \"Sakkusu\"), also referred to as the sax, is a family of woodwind instruments. Someone who plays the saxophone is called a \"saxophonist\" or simply a \"saxophone\/sax player\".Construction.Saxophones come in all shapes and sizes, but all varieties consist of the same general structure. It consists of a conical tube, usually made of brass, narrowest at the end nearest the player, and widest at the end, where it flares into the bell. All saxophones larger than the soprano are guaranteed to curve upwards 180\u00b0 at the bottom, which then has a segment that leads to the bell, however, some sopranos and even smaller varieties may have this upwards curve, but it is less common. The end of this tube closest to the player then connects to the neckpiece, whose shape and length depends on the type of saxophone, and has a piece of cork wrapped around one end. This cork is used to secure a seal when the mouthpiece is attached to the neck.Since it is a woodwind, it uses a reed to produce sound. In the saxophone's case, it uses a single-reed mouthpiece, similar to the clarinet. The reed is made of cane or plastic and comes in different strengths that alter the tone. Generally, the greater the strength of the reed, the more difficult it is to play on. Most players stick between a 2.5 strength or a 3 strength.The instrument has 23 standard keys that are used to change the pitch. It also has an octave key which facilitates reaching the upper register by opening two small speaker holes depending on the note being played (D to G open the first, A and beyond open the second).Variants.Generally speaking, saxophones are pitched in two keys: B\u266d and E\u266d. When the instrument was first created, there were also instruments in C and F, intended for orchestral use, however, they never became popular enough to remain relevant. Thus, very few of the latter still remain.The saxophone family is also hailed as one of the best examples of how an instrument family should function. It is very linear, especially in modern days, and it is easy to understand the members of the family.Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Baritone.The \"soprano\", \"alto\", \"tenor\" and \"bari\" or \"baritone\" saxophones are the 4 most common types of saxophones. Most saxophonists own or are at least experienced with all 4 of these, but tend to \"main\" one of them, usually alto or tenor.Soprillo.The \"sopranissimo\" or \"soprillo\" saxophone is the highest pitched member of the saxophone family. It is a transposing instrument pitched in B\u266d, one octave above the soprano. The instrument is so small that its uppermost register's key work has to be reduced by as much as 3 semitones as compared to a normal saxophone, as it is literally the size of a large fork. It is extremely difficult to play and there is very little demand for the instrument. It is currently only sold by one manufacturer as a result.Sopranino.The \"sopranino\" saxophone is the second smallest saxophone and the smallest in regular use. It is a transposing instrument pitched in E\u266d, one octave above the alto. It is uncommon for them to be curved, but some curved varieties do exist. It is also the smallest saxophone originally envisioned and constructed by Adolphe Sax, the creator of the saxophone.C Soprano.The \"C soprano\" saxophone is a variety of the saxophone, which, as the name suggests, is a soprano pitched in C. It existed to fill in the orchestral side of the saxophone family, but as the whole family was not well-received, the instrument did not make it past the first half of the 20th century. Some still exist, but they are not nearly as popular.It is slightly smaller than the B\u266d soprano sax, which is the only notable physical difference of the instrument. Tonally, it is near identical to the B\u266d soprano. Additionally, it is non-transposing, giving it an advantage over other members of the family.Aulochrome.The \"aulochrome\" is a unique variety of the saxophone. It consists of two B\u266d soprano saxophones which are attached together and can be played separately or dually. This modern amalgamation has not seen too much usage, as it is impractical, but there are some artists who have made use of the instrument.Mezzo-Soprano.The \"mezzo-soprano\" or \"F-alto\" saxophone is a rare, near-extinct breed of the saxophone. It is a transposing instrument pitched in F and is the only saxophone ever produced in this key. It is described as sounding like an alto in the mid-low register, but like a soprano in the higher register. It was only ever produced by one company for 2 years right before the Great Depression, and it was not very popular. Later, the remaining stock of instruments was intentionally damaged to teach new repair technicians how to fix saxophones, and after many years of bludgeoning, they eventually had to be scrapped.However, recently a Danish instrument maker has produced a mezzo-soprano saxophone in G, and there has been conversation among several companies about a revival of the F mezzo-soprano.C Melody.The \"C Melody Sax\", \"C Tenor Sax\" or simply \"Melody Sax\" is an uncommon variant of the tenor saxophone, pitched in C. It existed to fill in the orchestral side of the saxophone family, but as the whole family was not well-received, the instrument did not make it past the first half of the 20th century. Some still exist, but they are not nearly as popular.The instrument is slightly smaller than the B\u266d tenor sax but larger than the alto sax, and its neck is straight like an alto. Additionally, it is non-transposing, giving it an advantage over other members of the family.Bass.The \"bass saxophone\" is a large and somewhat uncommon member of the saxophone family. It is a transposing instrument pitched in B\u266d, one octave below the tenor. It has seen most of its use in early 20th-century jazz bands, and not many ensembles have used it since due to its impracticality. Interestingly, the first saxophone ever revealed to the public was a C bass saxophone in 1841.Contrabass, Subcontrabass, and Tubax.The \"contrabass\" and \"subcontrabass\" saxophones are the two lowest members of the saxophone family, both being incredibly rare. The contrabass is pitched in EE\u266d, one octave below the baritone, the subcontrabass pitched in CC, one octave lower than the C bass, and the subcontrabass is pitched in BB\u266d, one octave lower than the bass. Only the contrabass was designed by Adolphe Sax, and a functioning subcontrabass was not produced until the very end of the 20th century.Recently, both these instruments experienced a resurgence in popularity, and thus companies began producing them. Among them, one company invented a new type of saxophone known as the tubax. Its name is a portmanteau of tuba and sax since it is such a large instrument. Tubaxes exist in both E\u266d contrabass and B\u266d or C subcontrabass varieties. It was invented to compact the practical size of the instrument, as well as changing the size of the bore as compared to regular saxophones. Due to this, its tone is somewhat unlike regular saxophones, and it is often debated over whether or not it is truly a member of the saxophone family. Some say it is closer to a \"\", but its bore is much larger than such an instrument.Performance.The saxophone is often criticized as being the easiest wind instrument to play (save for the odd-ones-out like recorders), however, there is a great deal of nuance in playing that makes sax one of the most difficult to master. Every player will develop a unique tone that takes years of intense practice to achieve, and there are dozens of techniques that all great saxophonists must be able to perform. As such, this notion is far from the truth.The instrument's finger system is quite easy to understand and near-identical to the recorder, which a lot of students learn before picking up the sax. It is also much easier to produce a consistent tone compared to the clarinet, which experiences more resistance. Combined, this makes the instrument seem very easy. Further into their musical career, though, sax players have to learn techniques that are just as difficult as other instruments, like tonguing, and later extended range called \"altissimo\", which, combined with the fact that tonally it is quite difficult, puts it on par with other instruments.Some of the techniques saxophonists can expect to encounter include growling (achieved by humming while playing), bends, or slap-tonguing. Saxophonists need to cover a broad range of tones and techniques since they cover such a vast range of playing styles.Scoring.The saxophone is most commonly used in concert bands, jazz bands, marching bands, military bands, and occasionally symphony orchestras. It is also very popularly used as a solo instrument or in rock and pop music.The standard set of parts for a saxophone section is 1-2 altos, 1 tenor, and 1 baritone, though some pieces may also call for a soprano. Particularly in jazz bands, there may be another part for tenor, and early jazz music may have called for bass saxophone.The size of a saxophone section is dependent on the size of the ensemble as a whole, but typically there is two players to each part (except soprano if it is used). Sometimes the section is larger, particularly in modern school bands since the instrument is popular.As portrayed in \"Hibike! Euphonium\".There are nine students who play saxophone in the Kitauji High School Concert Band: Haruka Ogasawara (Baritone, President, Saxophone Section Leader) Raimu Okamoto (Alto) Kiriko Miya (Alto, Soprano) Hiroe Hashi (Alto) Shinobu Morita (Alto) Chikai Maki (Alto, Baritone\/Saxophone Section Leader (Sound! Euphonium 3)) Aoi Saitou (Tenor) (Formerly) Sumiko Hirao (Tenor\/Saxophone Section Leader ) Chikao Takigawa (Tenor)In \"\", several more sax players join the ensemble: Nanami Ootaki (Alto) Seiya Suzuki (Alto) Nakaba Hattori (Alto) Haruna Hosono (Alto) Kiri Matsumoto (Alto) Babe Uchida (Tenor) Machiko Nara (Tenor) Kyouko Ayukawa (Baritone) Tadashi Endou (Baritone)In \"Sound! Euphonium 3\", four more sax players join the ensemble:The saxophone was named after its inventor, . Saxophones are often mistaken as brass instruments since most of the instrument's construction is brass or some other type of metal. However, saxophones are considered woodwinds because of their use of a single-reed mouthpiece to produce sound. Of the few surviving C and F saxophones today, the C Tenor (Melody) is the most common. Only a handful of C sopranos and F altos have survived. There is only one surviving C Bass in the world. The F sopranino and F Baritone simply do not exist, despite the fact that they were scored by Maurice Ravel and Richard Strauss respectively in one piece each (Bol\u00e9ro and Symphonia Domestica respectively.)

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=6598","text":"Snare Drum, also called the Side Drum, or simply Snare, is an instrument in the percussion family. A musician who plays the snare drum is called a \"snare drummer\" or simply a \"snare drum player\".Construction.The snare drum consists of a short cylindrical frame or shell made of wood, metal, acrylic, or fiberglass. On the top face is a membrane, usually made of plastic, called the batter head which is struck, and on the bottom face is a resonant head which has an array of metal coiled wires (snare wires) stretched across the bottom head. When struck, the snare wires vibrate and give the instrument its distinctive buzz.Variants.Concert\/Drum Kit Snare Drum.The \"concert snare\" is the most basic version of the instrument. They are typically 36cm (14\") in diameter and 13cm to 20cm (5\" to 8\") in depth. These snare drums are also used in drum kits.Marching Snare Drum.The \"marching snare\" is a much larger version of the snare drum, usually about 2 to 3 times as deep as a concert snare and the same diameter. They are designed this way to produce a deeper tone, which is effective for marching bands.Piccolo Snare Drum.The \"piccolo snare\" is a smaller version of the snare drum used to produce a sharper noise and give more of a \"pop\". They typically have a depth of about 8cm (3\") and a diameter between 25cm to 36cm (10\" to 14\"). Due to the sharper tone, piccolo snares' sound travels further, thus making it easier for distant microphones to pick it up and making it difficult to record effectively.Performance.The snare drum provides a great deal of rhythm for the ensemble, and therefore performers must have an excellent sense of rhythm to perform properly. Players often make use of practice pads to practice rhythms without having a physical drum. This is ideal for practicing at home or on the go.Contrary to popular belief, there is a proper way to hold drumsticks, and it is one of the first steps to learn when becoming a percussionist\/drummer. Players can select from a variety of grips to suit their needs best. Additionally, players may also use brushes or other objects to strike the drum depending on the desired effect.Snares use a variety of techniques to maximize its usage in an ensemble. To begin with, the snare has two modes by default: \"on\" or \"off\". \"On\" is the default mode; the snares are engaged, and the standard snare drum sound is produced. However, the snares can be disengaged using a lever called the strainer on the side of the drum, which causes it to produce a sound much more akin to tom-tom. Some other techniques used on snare drums include the famous drum roll (also called tremolo) and rimshots, which can be achieved by striking the rim around the drumhead, producing a piercing noise.Scoring.Snare drums are used in almost every type of music. This includes, but is not limited to, concert bands, jazz bands, marching bands, military bands, symphony orchestras, rock music, popular music, and electronic music.The snare is often thought of as the most basic or standard percussion instrument, and thus most new percussionists will first learn to play rhythms on the snare drum, especially if they are not skilled in piano since then they cannot easily play mallet percussion.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".All the percussionists in the Kitauji High School Concert Band have the ability to play the snare drum, however Narai Tanabe seems most proficient in it. He has played it at competitions in \"Crescent Moon Dance\" and March \"Wind of Provence\", as well as part of a drumkit in \"Takarajima\", \"Gakuen Tengoku\", and \"Starting the Project\". Tsubame Kamaya also played snare in the first and second years' rendition of \"Crescent Moon Dance\"."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=4405","text":"Soprano Saxophone is the third smallest instrument in the saxophone family. It is smaller than the alto saxophone and is pitched one octave higher than the tenor saxophone. The soprano sax is pitched in the key of B\u266d, and written as a transposing instrument in the treble clef, sounding an octave and a major second lower than the written pitch.As portrayed in \"Sound! Euphonium\".There is one student, Kiriko Miya, who plays the soprano saxophone during Kitauji's performance of \"Takarajima\" at the station concert. However, under normal circumstances, she is an alto saxophone player. Soprano saxophones are rarely seen in concert bands. Soprano saxophones have a similar tone to oboes, and thus are sometimes used as a replacement for the latter. Soprano saxophones are also arguably one of the most difficult saxophones to play and pick up for beginners, since it is difficult to play in tune and in the upper register. Soprano saxophones in \"Sound! Euphonium\" are based on Yamaha YSS-475\/YSS-475II models."}

{"source":"https:\/\/hibike-euphonium.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=4150","text":"Sousaphone  is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba. Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (after whom the instrument was then named), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band. Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or \"buzz\" into a large cupped mouthpiece. Unlike the tuba, the instrument wraps around the player's waist, making it easier to carry while marching. It typically has three piston valves, but there are also models with four valves to increase range. It is most commonly used in marching bands.Hazuki Katou's, Satsuki Suzuki's and Mirei Suzuki's sousaphones are based on Yamaha YSH-301 model."}
