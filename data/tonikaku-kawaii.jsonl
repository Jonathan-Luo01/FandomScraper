She wears an Otogi uniform as well. Personality. Hakase is a student at Otogi all-girls high school. She is a very calm and collected person with a lot of ambition. In addition, she is usually the one that takes the lead most often. Plot. Hakase is introduced to the manga in this chapter. She was asking Nasa about his age during a programming class they attended together. While talking about Nasa, Hakase asks the other girls if they are interested in seeing his wife (Tsukasa), and also lets Kaguya get her first appearance in the manga. Summer has arrived, and Hakase's film research club is doing a limited-budget horror movie called \"The Moonlight Ghost Mansion.\" She gets assigned the costume designer position, and the location to film their movie is an old mansion at the corner of the town. Before they start shooting, Hakase thought the movie is incomplete and weak without a protagonist, so they began discussing a possible solution. At night, the action started with her being shocked that Aya (one of her favorite streamers) arrived and joined their film. The main goal of the film was to capture a Tokyo ghost called the \"Masakado Ghost.\" One of the top 3 ghosts in Japan, capturing its head would be an impressive achievement. Kurenai starts by laying down the ground rules of this mansion, which was not to damage anything since paying for it would cost them a fortune. After that, she went back to the filming room, observing all the scenes captured, and she was satisfied with most. In this final chapter of this arc, a machine is about to crash into the building, so she calls out to Kaguya for help since it will cost them a fortune if they break something. After the disaster, she thanked everyone who participated. Announcing she will finish the film in approximately three years, which Nasa and Tsukasa thought sounded unrealistic. Kurenai tells Hakase that she wants to become a comedian after seeing a trailer video for the M1 Grand Prix and thinking it was cool, to which Hakase calls her an idiot. Hakase mentions that Hotaru wanted to capture the world with singing, so Hotaru declares that she is probing to see if she loves singing by going for karaoke. When they enter the karaoke place, they end up bumping into Nasa, who was coming there for the first time with Tsukasa. Hotaru decides to ask Nasa to listen to her sing, sparking a karaoke contest. Tsukasa decides to sing first and goes with a \u201crecent\u201d song. Before she can start singing, Hotaru interrupts by asking Tsukasa if she wants to use the free cosplay service. While Tsukasa tries to refuse, Hotaru asks Nasa if he wants to see Tsukasa cosplay, which he declines at first. However, Hakase gives Nasa the menu for the cosplay service, and Nasa ends up going with the princess costume. Once Hotaru retrieves Tsukasa in costume, Nasa compliments her, and Tsukasa thanks him. We then get to see Tsukasa sing and Hakase calling Hotaru an idiot once more."}

But, who is this little teenager? Tsukasa knows only one thing: she is always searching for Kaname. Someone without logic could ask why the twin tails? Well, Kaname's friend is there to talk to Kaname, who is currently out, and she is busy and can't sit around and wait until Kaname comes home. Also, Tsukasa isn't listening to her and so, an obvious conclusion comes out: \"Kaname is in twin tails, right? So if you are in twin tails, then maybe you will listen to me\". And just before Tsukasa's mental sanity runs out completely, Kaname arrives home from school and the name of this mysterious girl quickly comes out: Kagami Kyuuma. She is Kaname's classmate and wasn't at school because she thought there was a holiday. Apparently she needs some H\u00e4agen Dazs or she won't feel like talking."}

She used to live with an old man and an old lady, but then they just vanished one day. She is very untidy. Her past is closely connected with that of Tsukasa. Plot. A hopeless young Kurenai Hotaru is desperately trying to study maths moments before the entrance exam while an unfamiliar girl wearing a mask points out to her what she should study and which formulae to pound in her head in the remaining 30 minutes. And so, the exam is no longer a problem, but how the heck did that mysterious girl know what was in it? Hotaru must know and can only ask her. Did she hack the system? Nope, the school has been around for a hundred years, she just glanced at the previous middle school exam subjects and exam questions with the result of the current exam problems becoming very clear. Hotaru's mind was infatuated by that \"magical girl\". Yeah, but what is her name? Kaguya Gekkou. Friendship with Kurenai Hotaru. This is the beginning of a bizarre friendship. Once middle school starts, Hotaru soon discovers that Kaguya isn't just a genius but she is quite queer. Indeed, her behaviour easily fluctuates from fixing broken things in a matter of seconds to eating a cucumber just for the nutrients without liking it and from very keen to very lazy. In all of this, Hotaru took care of her weird behaviour and convinces her to go to school as she often tends to think that going to school is pointless. On the other hand, Kaguya likes Hotaru and her dreams of being a YouTuber. But there is also something very shady about her past as there is a nightmare that keeps haunting her mind. In this dream, there is someone constantly sobbing, begging to put an end to \"that\" person's life. Kaguya (\u8d6b\u6620) means Bright Night. In the tale of the Bamboo Cutter, the name of the princess is Kaguya-Hime. Gekkou (\u6708\u5149) means Moon Light."}
{"url":"https:\/\/tonikaku-kawaii.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=168","text":"Kaname Arisugawa \"She's a really good girl. She's been helping manage the bathhouse for a long time now\"~~Nasa Kaname Arisugawa (\u6709\u6816\u5ddd \u8981, \"Arisugawa Kaname\") is one of the residents of the bathhouse that Nasa frequents. Appearance. Kaname has shoulder-length light hair tied up with two ribbons and blue eyes. Generally in school uniform; wearing bathhouse apron while working and taking it off before going to school. Personality. Kaname has a very outgoing personality. She's been helping the bathhouse for a long time. Despite being young, she is very mature and always gives good suggestions to Nasa to help him out with his couple life. Like her mom, she really likes dirty jokes and apparently, she has no fear of cleaning the males' bath while Nasa is in there. She isn't shy and prefers a direct approach. Plot. First encounter with Tsukasa. When Tsukasa and Nasa arrive at the bathhouse for the first time as a couple, Kaname is already working and is completely shocked that Nasa has brought a girl with him. Indeed, she thought that he had no interest in them. And once Nasa tells her that they are already married, she gets astonished even more. After congratulating them, Kaname invites Tsukasa in to take a bath as an excuse to talk alone with Nasa. In effect, she demands an explanation for what is going on. Because in her (queer) mind there were no possibilities for Nasa to get a girlfriend and she also dreams about him reaching 30-something years and be like \"I'm finally a magical girl\" and she will be like \"yes, you are a magical girl\". However, now that he is married, all these bizarre thoughts had been shattered. Delayed by some playful banter, in Kaname's mind comes out a little detail about his wife. For sure Tsukasa is beautiful, but she is also young. Nasa peacefully said. Yeah, peacefully, except for Kaname who doesn't hesitate for a second to call him a lolicon. Kaname then asks if he's told Aya about it but, he says that he hasn't and that makes our little teenager sigh and lose hope in Nasa (Indeed Aya, her sister, has a crush on him). But something else is bothering her right now: \"when is the ceremony?\" ...I didn't really think about that. \"the rings?\"...We aren't Christians, so...do we really need rings and stuff? \"did you propose?\" ...Oh right...I might have to do that. Nasa's ditzy answers truly hit and knock out her calmness. She now thinks he is lacking devotion for his wife and so, she turns into \"I will give you advice\"-mode. She suddenly becomes more mature and starts giving the first of many future suggestions to Nasa and that really helps Nasa's determination. Yeah, but she is not always so mature, she has a queer lewd side that pops out very soon when she enters the room where Nasa was taking a bath. Without any clear reason besides messing around and having fun with him, she stayed in the doorway and starts smiling and peeking. She picked on him so much that in the end, the poor guy exits the bath exhausted and without any force. A crowded bathhouse. When Nasa's apartment completely burns down, Nasa and Tsukasa have nowhere to go and Kaname kindly offers to Nasa and his wife to stay at the Arisugawa Bathhouse until they find a new place. And obviously, knowing Kaname, the offer can't be asked in a normal way and is asked while he was taking a bath and was quite turned on (he was thinking of Tsukasa). Kaname thinks that hosting Nasa and Tsukasa at the bathhouse is a nice way to thank Nasa for everything he has done for that place. But now, she is in a pickle, she lent them a spare room, she will meet every day the couple, who are living in the same place and will soon realize that Nasa is now married and yeah, this happens way sooner than expected. In the great disappointment of Aya who liked Nasa for years, Kaname, switching to her mature side, finds the correct words to help her. Quotes. [16]-\"Oh god! My senpai is getting more and more gross by the minute...!!\"\"~~Kaname talking about Nasa\" [20]-\"If I got married and my husband says\"small places are good enough\", I'll literally burn the house down and force him to move\" [33]-\"Once a husband stops helping his wife stay cute, the girl will change from a cute wife into your average roommate buddy!! And do you want that!? Senpai!!\" The name Kaname means \"pivot; vital point, cornerstone, keystone\" (\u8981). Kaname's surname Arisugawa means \"exist\" (\u6709) (ari), \"nest, rookery, hive, cobweb, den\" (\u6816) (su) and \"river, stream\" (\u5ddd) (gawa). The owner of the land and building of the bathhouse is actually Kaname-chan, so she manages more than 50 per cent of the business."}

Early Life. Childhood and Middle School. Apparently, his dad liked the idea that his son would become \" a man who's as vast as space...\" and so he named him Nasa (written as \"Hoshizora\").

In middle school, he was always top of the class in grades and was number one in the national mock exams consecutive times. He got perfect scores in every subject and earned the title of deviation value. But his education stopped in middle school. When he became a third-year student in middle school he applied for Tsukuba high school, one of the top-ranked schools in the country.

After discussing with his teacher about his future, the self-proclaimed \"man who'll attain the speed of light faster than NASA\" heads back home. With a lot of thoughts spinning around in his head on a snowy day, he encounters his fate. He finds a cute girl on the other side of the road. Infatuated by the girl and without any doubt that talking to her was the reason he was born, he crosses the road. But just as he gets halfway across the road, a truck comes speeding towards him. A terrible blow hits him and everything turns to black until he opens his eyes and sees the girl in front of him covered in blood just like him. It turns out she was the one who took most of the blow, protecting him. She tells the truck driver to take Nasa to a hospital, ignoring her own injuries. Nasa tries to reach out to her but, she tells him to \"just forget about me\" and vanishes into the night. He thought to himself that it looked like she was |Kaguya-Hime going back to the moon as she said that, before passing out. Nasa quickly wakes up and asks the driver where the girl went but, but he tells him that he shouldn't be moving due to his injuries. After a quick argument between the two, Nasa runs off to find the mystery girl in the snowy blizzard despite his worsening condition. He eventually finds her in a bus stop, thanking her and introducing himself. The girl is taken aback by his actions and simply tells him to sit down, taking out a handkerchief to clean of his blood. Nasa starts getting very embarrassed from being so close to her and even more so when she gives him her scarf. She decides to go get someone to help him just as his injuries start to get worse. Nasa starts to regret not waiting for an ambulance earlier but, still decides to go anyway, much to the girl's shock. He tells her that he thought she was Kaguya-Hime and recounts how in her story the emperor and old man should've tried harder to stop her from going back to the moon. Nasa finally works up the courage to confess his feeling to the girl and asks her to go out with him. After a moments silence, she turns around and tells him that if he marries her she'll go out with him. He answers with pride that he will, before finally passing out. Nasa later wakes up in a hospital, having been told that the girl had brought him there and left without giving him her name. He takes that as a sign that she refused him. As the days go by Nasa continues to recover and study, even though he missed his exams and entrance ceremony and doesn't have a job. After passing his exam in the new year, instead of going to high school, he decides to solely focus on jobs that involve delivery and serving customers in the hopes of meeting that girl once again. But that day seemed like it would never come and soon he was living on his own in a small apartment. Plot. Getting Married. Two years after his encounter with the mysterious girl, she suddenly arrives at his place much to his complete and utter shock. She finally introduces herself to him as Tsukasa, before asking if she can come in; calling him her husband. After his initial confusion, Nasa eventually lets her into his apartment, despite his very nervous state of mind. After the two of them settle down at the table, Tsukasa takes out a marriage form, completely shocking Nasa. She reminds him about the day they met and how he had agreed to marry her. After reaffirming his determination and feelings for her, Nasa fills out the relevant parts of the form, clearing away any doubt and confusion he still felt. He gives the form back to Tsukasa, who looks it over, as she thinks to herself how nice \"Yuzaki Tsukasa\" sounds. She then tells him that even though both of them are very uneasy about doing this, she can tell that he has a good eye for people and has never lied before. Tsukasa says that she completely trusts him and asks that he take care of her if he thinks that she is worth it. Nasa replies by asking her that she also take care of him before they head out to get their marriage form legitimized. The two of them head out to the office where they can get their form legitimized, with Nasa still a bit unsure if they can simply get married by handing over a piece of paper. As they walk along, Tsukasa muses over how nice her new name sounds, asking Nasa what he thinks. He says that it's a lot better than his which is written as \"Hoshizora \"but is actually \"Nasa\". He then realizes that she never said anything bad about his name, before she tells him about the history and efforts of NASA and how they eventually were able to put a man on the moon. She finishes by telling him that his name is a truly beautiful one. This causes him to think about how unreal this marriage is but, that his desire to marry her is most definitely real. They soon get their marriage finalized and also get a commemorative potted plant. Tsukasa suggests that they try holding hands now that they are married. Nasa gets so flustered about holding her hand that he calls marriage a lifelong buffet of handholding, which Tsukasa ends up hearing. She then tells him to take the plant back home as she has something that she needs to finish, before asking him if he has two futons at his place, to which he answers that he only has one. First Night Together. Nasa waits alone at his apartment for Tsukasa to come back, wrapping his head around the fact that they are now married. He quickly realizes that they will be sleeping on the same bed and tries to work out a way where the two of them can sleep comfortably on one bed. Tsukasa soon returns, much to Nasa's surprise and embarrassment. He asks what she had to do and she tells him that she went to get her luggage from a coin locker. Nasa then wonders if her family would be worried about her being out so late but, she says that she doesn't have a home now. Upon hearing this he decides that having one futon is fine and he can sleep on the floor but, Tsukasa suggests that she stay at a hotel for the night. Nasa seems displeased with the idea until she tells him that since she is his wife she won't be going anywhere, causing him to be completely taken aback by her words. He then wonders why she became his wife in the first place and asks her why she married him. Instead of answering him, Tsukasa asks Nasa why he married her, to which he answers that it was because he likes her. She then tells him that she would never marry someone who she didn't fall in love with. Nasa tries to ask her when she fell in love with him but, she says that it's a secret, much to his annoyance. As Tsukasa starts to leave, Nasa feels that if she goes now he'll never see her again. He tells her that they can buy a second futon, so she doesn't have to go. She agrees to this as long as they can try out a memory foam one. They visit a store to buy one with Tsukasa asking if this will be Nasa's first present to her, to which he answers yes. After arriving back at the apartment, she lies down on the new futon to try it out, causing him much embarrassment. Tsukasa asks if they have a bath but, Nasa says that they don't, telling her that he goes to a bathhouse each morning instead. Before going to sleep, the two of them go back out to buy some more sleeping goods. They finally both start to settle down for sleep, with Tsukasa thanking him for keeping her company and Nasa saying that he kept his promise from when they first met. Unfortunately, he is unable to get any proper sleep due to being completely distracted by her. After watching her toss and turn while sleeping Nasa wonders if he should give her a goodnight kiss but, decides against it. Tsukasa then suddenly gets up for a drink and upon returning to her futon, falls asleep atop his bed pulling the covers off as she slides back down to ground level. The Arisugawa Bathhouse. The next morning after getting up and changed, Tsukasa decides to get them breakfast. Curious to see what kind of food a bachelor would have she takes a look inside Nasa's fridge and is surprised at the reasonable amount of stuff he has. He tells her that he studied dietetics and worked out the \"best\" meal for him was hot pot every day. Unimpressed by this Tsukasa tells him to wait while she prepares their food. After ten minutes they sit down to eat, with Nasa totally surprised by the amazing results she produced. While eating, Tsukasa tells him that she noticed he still calls her Tsukasa-san, despite the fact that they are now married. They agree to come up with nicknames for each other, with Tsukasa calling him Nasa-kun and Nasa calling her Tsukasa-chan, much to her embarrassment. Once they finish their meal they decide to go to the bathhouse later, with Nasa really wanting to see her after she takes a bath. The two of them head out and after buying some lotion and various other things for Tsukasa, arrive at the bathhouse. Here they meet Nasa's kouhai in middle school: Arisugawa Kaname, who helps manage the bathhouse. Kaname is completely shocked that Nasa has brought a girl with him, as she thought that he had no interest in them. She asks if they are dating but, Nasa instead tells her that the two of them are married, shocking her even more. After congratulating them, Kaname invites Tsukasa in to take a bath. Nasa attempts to go in as well but is stopped by Kaname who demands an explanation for what is going on. She tells him that she always thought she would look after him when he got older, in a weird dream of hers. Kaname then asks if he's told Aya about it but, he says that he hasn't. She tells him that she won't tell Aya and asks when the ceremony is but, Nasa says that he hadn't thought about one or getting rings. After hearing that he hasn't even proposed to Tsukasa, Kaname tells him that since he decided to marry her he has a duty to make her happy. Filled with new resolve, Nasa declares that he will make Tsukasa happy because he loves her. Tsukasa walks out at this very moment to get her things and clearly hears what he just said, much to both of their embarrassment. She takes her things from him and tells him that even though she gets embarrassed when he says that in front of other people, she also gets really happy. While in the bath Nasa thinks to himself how the current situation lends itself to a bath chapter happening, where he'll get to see Tsukasa naked. He looks around to see what might happen but, instead sees Kaname standing in the doorway smiling at him. Nasa panics as she tells him to take his time and have fun, also saying that she heard everything he said. After Nasa's bath, Tsukasa meets back up with him and is accompanied by Kaname's older sister, Aya Arisugawa . Due to an earlier misunderstanding, Aya doesn't realize that the two of them are married and neither of them is aware of this. Tsukasa is told how Nasa helped support the Arisugawa family and their business after they fell on hard times. Tsukasa appears disappointed with hearing how grateful Aya is to Nasa but, he doesn't notice this. The two of them then leave the bathhouse and head back home. Tsukasa says how cute Aya seems to be with Nasa completely agreeing with her and not realizing his poor choice of words. Just as he realizes this he sees her looking at a church wedding and remembers what Kaname told him about their marriage. He asks if she is concerned about that \"thing\" (no ceremony or rings) but, she assumes he is talking about Aya and totally gets the wrong idea. Tsukasa says that she wants him to say that she is cute too but he still misunderstands. After some back and forth he decides that he can't say it right now and goes off to check something, telling her to go back home and wait for him. Chitose Kaginoji. When Nasa arrives back at the apartment he sees a young girl sat outside crying. He asks if she's alright, to which she says yes and that it has nothing to do with him. Despite this Nasa gives her a handkerchief saying that he can't just leave someone who's crying in front of him. The girl tells him that her \"sister\" hasn't come home yet but, she doesn't want to bother her by calling the police because of how delicate and easily hurt she is. She also says that even though she vanishes if you take your eyes off her, she is still precious to her. The young girl tells Nasa how kind he is to listen to the story of a stranger even though he must be in the middle of doing something. He says that he's looking for a place to propose but before she can tell him where to go for that, Tsukasa appears behind them. Seeing the two of them casually talking to each other and how Tsukasa called Nasa \"dear\", the girl suddenly gets very angry and realizes that Nasa is her \"sister's\" (Tsukasa's) husband. Tsukasa tells Nasa that the girl is Chitose Kaginoji, a girl who was taken in by her family. Nasa casually introduces himself to her and starts a conversation despite Chitose's protests. She states that she will not accept him as Tsukasa's partner in marriage. Surprisingly he shows his good communication skills by saying she's not wrong for thinking that, due to how sudden it all was. He suggests that they go and have a nice chat about it but, Tsukasa tells him that Chitose won't simply accept that. Proving her right, Chitose calls a limo and proceeds to kidnap Nasa. After arriving at her mansion, she tells him that she will use a sex scandal to ruin their marriage. Chitose calls her two maids; Charlotte and Aurora and tells them to get Nasa into a sex scandal. While Aurora is unsure Charlotte immediately starts to take her clothes off, much to everyone else's shock. Nasa takes this opportunity to escape and hides in a room, which belongs to Tsukasa. Looking around the room, he sees various space-related items including a spacesuit, a model of a spacecraft and some globes of planets. Finally, he notices a glass case with a moonstone. Due to how well kept and maintained it appears to be Nasa concludes that the stone is indeed real but, says that it's almost impossible for one to be here. Suddenly Charlotte appears with a large sword breaking her way into the room and telling him that he isn't allowed in there. She proceeds to start attacking him but, Chitose and Aurora arrive shouting at her to not be so reckless in that room. Unfortunately, she ends up damaging the case with the moonstone in it. Nasa however quickly manages to fix it, preserving the moonstone and also works out from Chitose's reaction that the stone is definitely real. She tells him that their grand-aunt borrowed it to ease Tsukasa. Upon hearing Nasa's confusion about this she realizes that he doesn't know what Tsukasa is and asks if he knows anything about her past. He answers that he doesn't which causes Chitose to get really angry that her \"sister\" married someone who knew nothing about her. Charlotte intervenes saying that Nasa did save Tsukasa's moonstone and hugs him as thanks but, Aurora takes this chance to take a picture of them and edits it to make it look indecent. Just then Tsukasa appears taking the picture and remarking about how \"nice\" it looks, much to Nasa's shock. Chitose tells her to get a divorce because of how terrible he is. She seems to agree to this telling him to follow her so they can talk it over. Once they leave the room Tsukasa reveals that she was just pretending so they could escape and if she really was mad things would be much worse for him. Once they hear Chitose calling after them they make their getaway, with Nasa thinking to himself how even though he knows nothing about her past, what's more important right now is their future life together. They soon find themselves in an old church on top of a hill, with Tsukasa saying that it was prepared as an escape route. She also tells him that she wanted to show it to him because it's a really wonderful place. Seeing her so bright and happy Nasa realizes what devotion really is. He starts to tell her that; if something good happens to him she'll be the first to know, if something bad happens to her he'll carry the burden with her, they'll share everything, support each other and that he doesn't want her to ever regret choosing him as her husband. Nasa says how that is the kind of couple he wants them to be. Tsukasa notes how that all sounded like a proposal, to which he answers that it was before kissing her and swearing to give his eternal love. Otogi high school. Japan is making each child own one pc so the educational revolution can progress. The teachers as part of this \"revolution\" are trying to strengthen their programming class and between them, there is a hopeless Naoko Yanagi. Why is she hopeless? Simple, she can't understand the programming language. But, there is a solution: our kind boy Nasa. Indeed, she can call an outsider who has no teaching license if he volunteers. Though, he wasn't expecting questions about romantic problems and can't deny any answers as the students are intrigued by his life: he is 17 years old and married to a 16-year-old girl. But that is not all, as the girls want to see what kind of girl his bride is and are amazed by how smart he is. Moreover, to add fuel to the fire, everyone in the Otogi school sucks at programming where \"everyone\" means students and teachers. And so, in order to make it easier for everyone to learn, our little genius Nasa created a grading system that anyone can use and it was so good that the headmaster decides to promote him to a special temp teacher. One problem solved and another one appears on the way back. Indeed, a blackboard in an empty class catches his attention. It is a mathematical formula calculating the trajectory of a rocket towards the moon and even though the equation itself isn't wrong, it doesn't consider the possibility of coming back. However, a (not so) simple equation added by Nasa, gives a way for them to come back to earth. The equation was actually written by Kaguya, a very smart student from the Otogi high school, who didn't like Nasa's help that much and has a message for him: Did we forget about anyone? Yep, Tsukasa or should we say a Jealous wifey? Indeed, now that Nasa is teaching at an all-girls school there is a chance his students will steal his heart or so Aya thinks. How to deal with this threat? Well, looking back at the Babylonians...An eye for an eye and a high school girl for a high school girl and therefore an Otogi high school uniform on Tsukasa was put. Conclusion? Needless to say, it is a victory! Nasa cannot resist such a combo. Quotes. [1]-\"My name is Yuzaki Nasa!!

Nasa's surname Yuzaki means \"reason, case, cause\" (\u7531) (yu) and \"cape, peninsula\" (\u5d0e) (saki\/zaki).  One of the great contention among fans is the fact that Nasa, an 18-year-old, married Tsukasa Tsukuyomi who was a 16-year-old. Although girls in Japan can get married at 16 as long as there is individual and parental consent, this tradition is currently being deratified by the Japanese government as early as 2018 with the new proposed Japan\u2019s Civil Code. In Episode 2, even Nasa himself was shocked to hear that Tsukasa was only 16 (but didn't do anything about it at that time). In Episode 3, Kaname Arisugawa even remarked and teased that Nasa was a pedophile. Nasa's favorite number is 11. Despite his Job in a supermarket and freelance, he is quite a successful Cryptocurrency Trader, he may have done it just to prove his parents wrong. As of chapter 163, Nasa and Tsukasa has only been married for 3 months. Nasa is way more daring than he looks, at least when he is alone with Tsukasa. Nasa has a love\/hate relationship with toast, his cat. He loves him cause he likes to see Tsukasa play with him. But, also hates him because He interferes with their \"Alone\" time. Nasa likes white lingerie. Before he got his Driving License, he was scared to drive a car at even 30km\/h (to compare, that is comparable to someone casually driving a bicycle)."}

His speech is very... strange, he always makes people misunderstand that he is a Yakuza even though he is just a student. His tone is also pretty aggressive. He calls normal stuff in a very thug-ish way, he called school as \"streets\" or \"turf\", sports meet as a \"gang war\", class as \"gang\", \"strategies solving answers for pop quizzes\" as \"how to kill during raids\", He also calls his teacher \"boss\", Chores\/Tasks as \"Raids\", Kitten Milk as \"White Powder\"(This is the point when even Nasa asked Ginga to watch his phrases) and Toys as \"Blasters. which generally sets his way to be misunderstood by many. Yet, after all of that Yakuza talk, He is very pure at heart considering he helps many strangers from simple tasks to helping them from danger, he likes to protect people, and respects others privacy. For example, he stopped Nasa and Tsukasa from kissing each other to prove their love is real to him. Appearance. He is very tall and always wears an elegant suit even though he is just a student. He has short straight hair. He always has a serious look as he wants to act tough. Story. First encounter with Tsukasa. While Tsukasa and Kaname were alone at the Arisugawa bathhouse, he steps in. He is looking for Nasa, but his shady behaviour and direct approach don't help him at all. Tsukasa quickly gets irritated and for the sake of her beloved husband, she doesn't step back a bit, even if the possibility of him being a Yakuza is right. And just when the situation is all fired up, Nasa arrives home and it turns out he is a friend of the strange guy, Ginga-Kun. Kaname, after hearing that queer name, associated it with another bizarre one (Yes, Nasa) and she deduced he is a relative of Nasa. Indeed he is Nasa's cousin. After Ginga's excuses for all the misunderstandings he has caused, he starts explaining to wifey how Nasa helps him all the time during middle school, even though he changes a lot of words in his explanation with ones more sullen. He is not a yakuza, but he behaves like one. The discussion between the four (Our couple, Kaname and Ginga-kun) continues in a nice way and Nasa's cousin gets interested in the relationship between Nasa and Tsukasa. After some playful banter, it jumps out that Nasa and Tsukasa need to prove their love is real to Ginga-kun. How to prove it? Obviously, a vowing kiss. The only one who opposes this is Tsukasa (Nasa wants that kiss so badly) and she gets very embarrassed at the idea of kissing him in public. But right at the culminant moment, Ginga-kun approves of their love and Nasa misses a chance to kiss his wife. What a shame o.O What did Ginga-Kun need? He wants to use Nasa's wisdom. Indeed he has something he wants to let Nasa see and he lets his underlings (Students and teacher from his school) bring it in. What's the important thing he needs to show to Nasa? A kitten. One of his \"subalterns\" (schoolmate) found it outside of their \"office\" (school) and he can't abandon him. Also, it would be weird for a \"Yakuza\" to have a kitten and so, why not leave him to Nasa: a true cat lover. Shirogane. Shirogane Yaiba, Nasa's student, has fallen in love with an utter mess of guy and this page is about Ginga, guess what? It is him. After some misapprehensions, she finds the right occasion to confess. Indeed, Ginga has finally found his stalker (he was being stalked by someone) and traps him in a dark narrow space and that is a perfect spot for a confession. She confesses her love to him even though something very violent was going on in the background. But this is a peaceful wiki and we would never say he was beating his stalker. The reply?

For a woman of such a small stature, she is pretty feisty and carnal. Even though she wasn't originally like that, she was made into such because she was deprived of romance. She may have a complex on how she is the cute popular girl.Even if her personality is extremely dirty, she is very caring of children, considering, she took in Himari as her daughter and teaches in a high school. History. Young Life. Being a cute girl of a very short stature, Sanae was adored by everyone in her middle school and high school, but unfortunately for her, she was so adored that the girls were protective of her, maybe overprotective. If she ever talked to a boy, the girls would try to micromanage them. If a boy was ever seen or looked like they had a romantic interest in her, they would try to stop the boy and send them off by calling them a lolicon. They would always try to force their belief that Boys are \"Perverts\" or \"Beasts\" even though they were normal. In reality, Sanae was the real beast, due to her lack of interaction with boys, her curiosities ran wild and she was the one who wanted to get pervy. Unfortunately, she could never say or admit it to the girls, so her days in school ended uneventfully without ever finding romance. College Life. Sanae still hoping to get a date, finally got into a college. now, without the influence of the girls in her old school. Unfortunately for her, even that dream was cut short abruptly when Himari Kousaka, Her cousin came to her house. Sanae was now to take care of orphaned Himari whose mother passed away in a Tsunami. But, even though money was tight, and she had a dream to get a boyfriend; she took responsibility for Himari and took her in as her own daughter. Plot. Introduction. Sanae was first introduced as a teacher, at the start of Nasa's career as a honorary teacher in Otogi Girl's High School; when the class burst in outrage after hearing that Nasa was married, Sanae burst through the doors to shut the class up and scolded Yanagi for not keeping the quite, saying \"If you don't keep the noise down, I'll make you all cry for real\". She was called scary by a few students. Yanagi's Marriage. Sanae is later shown having a drink with Naoko Yanagi, congratulating Yanagi because she is about to get married. here, we get to see that she is not even that strict; rather she is someone who get's easily annoyed. It's also revealed that Yanagi and Sanae are good friends, and that Sanae is the first to know about Yanagi's marriage. Afterwards they walk home together, Sanae is reminiscing about how Yanagi is getting married, that's when Yanagi asks her if she ever considered marriage. Sanae denies, saying that it's hard to get something serious going while living with her parents. When Yanagi asks if she's ever gonna move out, she says she wants to help them, Yanagi therefore calls her a saint. Soon, Sanae asks if Yanago told \"the yuzaki kid\" about her marriage, when Yanagi said not yet, she urged her to tell him as soon as possible. Her Family has a history of dying young. She may be bad in computer coding considering how the teachers median score was only marginally better than the students who scored very low, which Nasa considered bad. She is jealous of every love couple, because she threw away her dreams to take care of Himari. She truly cares for Himari and worries Asimo might do something bad to her when they start dating. She also does not want her years of no romance to go to waste if something happened to Himari. She really wants free time, so that she can finally go out on a date."}

It is considered one of the oldest extant Japanese prose narrative. It primarily details the life of a mysterious girl called Kaguya, who was discovered as a baby inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant. Main Characters. The Bamboo Cutter. Taketori no Okina (the Old Man who Harvests Bamboo in the tale) was married, but he had no children although he and his wife would have like one. He was very poor and sad, for no child had Heaven sent to cheer his old age, and in his heart, there was no hope of rest from work till he died. Kaguya-Hime. She was found in a glowing stalk of bamboo from Taketori no Okina. \"\u201cYou must be sent to be my child, for I find you here among the bamboos where lies my daily work,\" \"he said. Three months passed quickly away, and in that time the bamboo child had, wonderful to say, become a full-grown girl, so her foster-parents did up her hair and dressed her in beautiful kimonos. He gave her the name of Kaguya-hime (Princess Moonlight) because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the Moon God. The Moon people. The people of the Moon are the ones who sent the gold that Takeotri no Okina had kept finding in the bamboo stalks to pay for her keep and as a reward for taking care of her. They had sent Kaguya-hime to earth because she needed to learn an important lesson. The Emperor. The Emperor of Japan fell head over heels in love with Kaguya and begged her to marry him countless times. Connections between Tsukasa and Kaguya. In most likely all the important situations in the manga there is the moon. Coincidences? Tsukasa seems to have a wide range of knowledge concerning aspects of Japanese history. This includes how to handle a Katana properly and information regarding various locations and landmarks. Indeed when she went to Nara, she talks about such things as if she had experienced them herself but never elaborates. She also appears to have some connection with the moon as her grand-aunt, Tokiko, borrowed a moonstone to help \"\"ease her\". \"Her surname: Tsukuyomi refers to the moon god in Shinto and Japanese mythology. A recent theory links the \"C\" in Cawaii to the shape of a crescent moon. The fact she married Nasa comes in contraposition with every time Kaguya refused the emperor's proposes. And that highlights a possible theory in which Tsukasa married Nasa because she is repented for refusing a marriage with the emperor in the past. Obviously, that makes sense only if she is Kaguya. Quotes:. \" He thought to himself that it looked like she was Kaguya-Hime going back to the moon as she said that, before passing out \" ~~Nasa, chapter 1 \"A moonstone to ease Tsukasa\" Chitose, Chapter 14 \"A glass butterfly that flutters through the night to the moon.\" Chitose talking about Tsukasa The Complete Tale. Long, long ago, there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter. He was very poor and sad also, for no child had Heaven sent to cheer his old age, and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave. Every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky. When he had made his choice, he would cut down these feathers of the forest, and splitting them lengthwise, or cutting them into joints, would carry the bamboo wood home and make it into various articles for the household, and he and his old wife gained a small livelihood by selling them. One morning as usual he had gone out to his work, and having found a nice clump of bamboos, had set to work to cut some of them down. Suddenly the green grove of bamboos was flooded with a bright soft light, as if the full moon had risen over the spot. Looking round in astonishment, he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo. The old man, full of wonder, dropped his ax and went towards the light. On nearer approach he saw that this soft splendor came from a hollow in the green bamboo stem, and still more wonderful to behold, in the midst of the brilliance stood a tiny human being, only three inches in height, and exquisitely beautiful in appearance. \u201cYou must be sent to be my child, for I find you here among the bamboos where lies my daily work,\u201d said the old man, and taking the little creature in his hand he took it home to his wife to bring up. The tiny girl was so exceedingly beautiful and so small, that the old woman put her into a basket to safeguard her from the least possibility of being hurt in any way. The old couple were now very happy, for it had been a lifelong regret that they had no children of their own, and with joy they now expended all the love of their old age on the little child who had come to them in so marvelous a manner. From this time on, the old man often found gold in the notches of the bamboos when he hewed them down and cut them up; not only gold, but precious stones also, so that by degrees he became rich. He built himself a fine house, and was no longer known as the poor bamboo woodcutter, but as a wealthy man. Three months passed quickly away, and in that time the bamboo child had, wonderful to say, become a full-grown girl, so her foster-parents did up her hair and dressed her in beautiful kimonos. She was of such wondrous beauty that they placed her behind the screens like a princess, and allowed no one to see her, waiting upon her themselves. It seemed as if she were made of light, for the house was filled with a soft shining, so that even in the dark of night it was like daytime. Her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there. Whenever the old man felt sad, he had only to look upon his foster-daughter and his sorrow vanished, and he became as happy as when he was a youth. At last the day came for the naming of their new-found child, so the old couple called in a celebrated name-giver, and he gave her the name of Princess Moonlight, because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the Moon God. For three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music. All the friends and relations of the old couple were present, and great was their enjoyment of the festivities held to celebrate the naming of Princess Moonlight. Everyone who saw her declared that there never had been seen any one so lovely; all the beauties throughout the length and breadth of the land would grow pale beside her, so they said. The fame of the Princess\u2019s loveliness spread far and wide, and many were the suitors who desired to win her hand, or even so much as to see her. Suitors from far and near posted themselves outside the house, and made little holes in the fence, in the hope of catching a glimpse of the Princess as she went from one room to the other along the veranda. They stayed there day and night, sacrificing even their sleep for a chance of seeing her, but all in vain. Then they approached the house, and tried to speak to the old man and his wife or some of the servants, but not even this was granted them. Still, in spite of all this disappointment they stayed on day after day, and night after night, and counted it as nothing, so great was their desire to see the Princess. At last, however, most of the men, seeing how hopeless their quest was, lost heart and hope both, and returned to their homes. All except five Knights, whose ardor and determination, instead of waning, seemed to wax greater with obstacles. These five men even went without their meals, and took snatches of whatever they could get brought to them, so that they might always stand outside the dwelling. They stood there in all weathers, in sunshine and in rain. Sometimes they wrote letters to the Princess, but no answer was vouchsafed to them. Then when letters failed to draw any reply, they wrote poems to her telling her of the hopeless love which kept them from sleep, from food, from rest, and even from their homes. Still Princess Moonlight gave no sign of having received their verses. In this hopeless state the winter passed. The snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring. Then the summer came, and the sun burned white and scorching in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, and still these faithful Knights kept watch and waited. At the end of these long months they called out to the old bamboo-cutter and entreated him to have some mercy upon them and to show them the Princess, but he answered only that as he was not her real father he could not insist on her obeying him against her wishes.

She was the minister of education, but she resigned a few days after Nasa and Tsukasa married. As for why she says she is worried about her health and she may no longer be involved in politics due to her age. Appearance. She is old and wrinkly, her hair is naturally silver and usualy knots it in a bun. As a younger woman, she used to wear a ponytail. She has brown eyes and usually wears a traditional Kimono but has also been shown wearing modern clothes like a Hoodie and Pants. Personality. She had great influence and power. Indeed, she easily tracks down Tsukasa's location while she was still living in Nasa's apartment. Story. Background. Born around 1937. As a little girl at the end of world war 2, she was taken in by Tsukasa. Tsukasa eventually told her about who she was. Tokiko promised to make her wish come true. Ultimately when the United States went to the moon during the 60s, Tokiko ended up retrieving a moon rock for Tsukasa somehow to comfort her. Tokiko later became minister of education later in life. First appearance. When Nasa and Tsukasa went to a hot spring resort, she appeared in front of Nasa acting like she was lost because the resort was too big. When Nasa takes her back to her own room, Tsukasa appears and reveals her identity as her grandaunt. Apparently, she is there just to mess around and make acquaintances with Nasa. Tokiko was wondering what kind of guy her \"little ice queen\" ended up falling in love with. And so, after a quite relaxed conversation, she leaves them alone with a nice pearl for Nasa. Camping. Tokiko has invited Nasa, Tsukasa and everyone else to a trip to the mountains aka camping in a wide area bought ages ago by Tokiko just so she could gaze up at the stars until she became bored and turned it into a camping grounds. It's evening up in the mountain, the moon is high in the sky and everyone is enjoying a plentiful barbecue in a peaceful atmosphere. But, there is always a \"but\" and in this case, it heats up the air. Indeed, Tokiko and Kaname have organized something for our couple. A giant display pops up from nowhere. What does this mean? Tokiko-san really wanted to have a wedding reception and so, Kaname has organized one with the help of Nakiri. Yeah, but what kind of thing could a person like Kaname ever do? An embarrassing video! Wait, not soo embarrassing, just a regular (embarrassing) video featuring Nasa and Tsukasa in different situations while Nakiri's voice revives their love story. Once the wedding reception is finished and everyone is enjoying the fireworks that Tsukasa brought, Tokiko proposes that Nasa talk alone with her and not about weird things as Tsukasa thinks. The chitchat is not so serious, but still earnest. The main argument is Nasa's marriage and it doesn't take too long for Tokiko to understand that Nasa is truly a clever boy and has realized more things about Tsukasa than she thought. Death. Tokiko died of natural causes, and left a letter containing her final will for Nasa and Tsukasa. Through the will, she nagged and made fun of Tsukasa a lot. Which undoubtedly made Tsukasa embarrased and sore. But she also had requested Nasa to stay by Tsukasa's side no matter what, and Tsukasa to give happiness to Nasa in return. She had asked Tsukasa to not attend her Funeral as she did not want Tsukasa to cry over her lifeless face. She entrusted her ashes with Tsukasa, wishing that Tsukasa would spread her ashes over the lake in the camping grounds by the end of the year, together with Nasa. At the end of the will, she thanked Tsukasa for everything while entrusting everything to Her and Nasa. The Letter also contained a 5D storage crystal device that contained very important information regarding the research and experiments she did on Tsukasa's Powers, which she called \"a small present for Nasa\" in the will. Tokiko passed away on July 20th. She can program in C. She is officially deceased as of Chapter 140.5. Her date of death was July 20th."}

{"url":"https:\/\/tonikaku-kawaii.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=161","text":"Tsukasa Tsukuyomi Tsukasa Yuzaki (n\u00e9e Tsukuyomi) is the titular heroine of the series. She is the wife of Nasa Yuuzaki and his savior. Appearance. Often described as beautiful, Tsukasa has long pink hair with a Barrette on the back. She has a red-ish pink eyes. She mostly wears elegant clothing and a skirt. While at home she is typically seen wearing modern clothing. During the trip to Kyoto, she wore a floral Yukata. Her signature outfit is a simple long sleeve white shirt, a mini black skirt, and pink socks. When she sleeps she wears a long sleeves pink shirt and pajamas with a purple stripe at the bottom of her leg sleeve, and puts her hair in two buns. Personality. At first, Tsukasa appears to act very cool, calm, and level-headed; seemingly unsurprised by Nasa's rash and illogical actions. Despite this, she agreed to marry Nasa and does love him very dearly. As they get to know each other, she starts to display more emotions than simply acting calm; she gets embarrassed very easily whenever Nasa proclaims his love for her and how cute she is. Tsukasa also seems to get jealous at times, like when Nasa talked about how cute Aya was. While she acts indifferent towards Chitose (despite her family taking her in), she does end up developing an understanding relationship with Kaname Arisugawa. Tsukasa's most prominent trait, however, is her genuine kindness. Like Nasa, she is also a kind, helpful person and cares for others. One characteristic she has is her huge love for movies, games, and pop-culture in general, so much so that she was quite saddened by the fact that her and Nasa's apartment didn't have a TV. She also seems to have a wide range of knowledge concerning aspects of Japanese history. This includes how to handle a Katana properly and information regarding various locations and landmarks. Tsukasa always talks about such things as if it happened in front of her own eyes, it seems she always does this. She also appears to have some connection\/obsession with the moon as her grand-aunt, Tokiko, gave her a Moon Rock she obtained from the Apollo missions. Plot. One day while walking along in the snow, Tsukasa noticed a boy on the other side of the road looking at her. However, as he started to cross over to her a truck came speeding towards him. Just as it was about to collide with him she rushed forward and took most of the blow, protecting the boy. Tsukasa tells the truck driver to take the boy to a hospital despite her own injuries. The boy attempts to reach out to her but, she says that he should just forget about her and leaves him. Later while reading in a bus stop, the boy suddenly appears thanking her and introducing himself as Yuzaki Nasa. Tsukasa is quite surprised that he followed her despite his condition but, tells him to sit with her while she cleans his blood off and gives him her scarf. She then decides to get proper help for him as his injuries are getting worse. As she starts to leave the boy tells her that he thought she looked like Kaguya-Hime and about how the emperor and old man in her story should have tried to stop her from going back to the moon. He then confesses his feelings for her and asks her to go out with him. After thinking it over, Tsukasa tells him that if he marries her she'll agree to go out with him. The boy answers that he will, before passing out. Getting Married. Two years later Tsukasa finds where Nasa lives and goes to see him. She introduces herself and calls him her husband. After some uncertainty, Nasa lets her into his apartment. As they sit down at the table Tsukasa produces a marriage form, reminding him how he had agreed to marry her. Nasa thinks this over before deciding to fill out the form. Once finished he hands her the form and Tsukasa looks it over while saying how nice \"\"Yuzaki Tsukasa\" \"sounds. She then proceeds to tell Nasa that even with both of them being nervous about doing this, she can tell he has a good eye for people and has never lied before. Tsukasa also says she completely trusts him, asking him to take care of her if he thinks she is worth it. Nasa replies by asking that she take care of him as well before the two of them go out to get their marriage form legitimized. As they head to the office where they can get their form legitimized, Tsukasa muses over how nice her new name sounds, asking Nasa what he thinks. He says that it's a lot better than his which is written as \"Hoshizora \"but is actually \"Nasa\". She then starts to tell him about the history and efforts of NASA and how they eventually were able to put a man on the moon. Tsukasa finishes off by telling Nasa that his name is truly a beautiful one. They soon get their marriage finalized, also getting a commemorative potted plant. Now that they are a married couple, Tsukasa suggests trying to hold hands. Nasa gets so flustered about this that he ends up calling marriage a lifelong buffet of handholding, which Tsukasa ends up hearing. She then asks him to take the plant back home as she has something that she needs to finish, before asking him if he has two futons at his place, to which he answers that he only has one. Tsukasa soon returns to the apartment where she finds Nasa trying to work out a way for both of them to sleep together on one bed. He asks what she had to do and she tells him that she went to get her luggage from a coin locker. Nasa wonders if her family is worried about her being out so late but, she says that she doesn't have a home now. Upon hearing this he decides that having one futon is fine and he can sleep on the floor but, Tsukasa suggests that she stay at a hotel for the night instead. Nasa seems uncertain with the idea until she tells him that since she is his wife she won't be going anywhere. He then asks her why she married him. Instead of answering his question Tsukasa asks Nasa why he married her, to which he answers that it was because he likes her. She tells him that she would never marry someone whom she didn't already fall in love with. Nasa tries to ask her when she fell in love with him but, she says that it's a secret, much to his annoyance. As Tsukasa starts to leave, Nasa tells her that they can buy a second futon, so she doesn't have to go. She agrees to this as long as they can try out a memory foam one. They visit a store to buy one with Tsukasa asking Nasa if this will be his first gift to her, to which he answers yes. After arriving back at the apartment, she lies down on the new futon to try it out, causing him much embarrassment. Tsukasa asks if they have a bath but, Nasa says that they don't, telling her that he goes to a bathhouse each morning instead. Before going to sleep, the two of them go back out to buy some more sleeping goods. They finally both start to settle down for sleep, with Tsukasa thanking him for keeping her company and Nasa saying that he kept his promise from when they first met. Throughout the night Tsukasa tosses and turns in bed keeping Nasa awake. She eventually gets up for a drink and upon returning to her futon, falls asleep atop his bed pulling the covers off as she slides back down to ground level. The next morning after getting up and changed, Tsukasa starts to get breakfast prepared. Curious to see what kind of food a bachelor eats she takes a look inside Nasa's fridge and is surprised to see a reasonable amount of stuff. He tells her that he studied dietetics and worked out the \"best\" meal for him was hot pot every day. Unimpressed by this, Tsukasa tells him to wait while she prepares their food. After ten minutes they sit down to eat, with Nasa totally surprised by the amazing meal she made. While eating, Tsukasa tells him that she noticed he still calls her Tsukasa-san, even though they are a married couple. They decide to come up with nicknames for each other, with Tsukasa calling him Nasa-kun and Nasa calling her Tsukasa-chan, much to her embarrassment. Once they finish their meal they decide to go to the bathhouse later. The two of them head out and after buying some lotion and other items for Tsukasa, arrive at the bathhouse. Here they meet Nasa's kouhai in middle school: Arisugawa Kaname, who helps manage the bathhouse. She is completely surprised by the fact that Nasa brought a girl with him, as she thought he had no interest in them. She asks if they are dating but, Nasa instead tells her that the two of them are married, shocking her even more. After congratulating them (albeit still a bit unsure) Kaname invites Tsukasa in to take a bath. Nasa attempts to go in as well but is stopped by Kaname who demands an explanation for what is going on. After a short while, Tsukasa walks out to get her things, just in time to hear Nasa declare his love for her very loudly, embarrassing them both. She takes her things from him and says that even though she gets embarrassed when he says that in front of other people, she also gets really happy. Once she checks that no one else is around, Tsukasa starts to enjoy her bath. Soon, another girl appears in the bath with her; she introduces herself to her as the eldest daughter of the bathhouse. She apologizes for watching Tsukasa while she was bathing and asks if she would like her back wiped to make up for it. After some persuasion, she takes her up on her offer. The girl remarks on how beautiful Tsukasa's skin, comparing it to silk but, then instead decides to compare it to an iPhone x for reasons unknown to Tsukasa. The girl then gives her name as Arisugawa Aya and Tsukasa introduces herself as Yuzaki Tsukasa, with Aya assuming she's Nasa's little sister. After their bath, Tsukasa and Aya meet up with Nasa. Tsukasa is told how Nasa helped support the Arisugawa family and their business after they fell on hard times. She appears disappointed with hearing how grateful Aya is to Nasa but, he doesn't notice this. The two of them leave the bathhouse and head back home. Tsukasa says how cute Aya seems to be with Nasa completely agreeing with her and not realizing his poor choice of words. As she looks at a church wedding, Nasa asks if she is concerned about that \"thing \"(no ceremony or rings) but, she assumes he is talking about Aya and totally gets the wrong idea. Tsukasa says that she wants him to say that she is cute too but he still misunderstands. After some back and forth he decides that he can't say it right now and goes off to check something, telling her to go back home and wait for him. Tsukasa arrives back at the apartment on her own and starts to wait for Nasa to return. She decides to clean the place but, unfortunately, finds that it is spotless and she doesn't want to risk seeing what sort of \"\"secret\" \"things he might have hidden away. Soon the doorbell rings and Tsukasa, who assumes it's Nasa goes to answer, only to be greeted by a young girl called Chitose. She refers to Tsukasa as her \"sister\" and says how the place she is staying in doesn't suit her. Before she can finish Tsukasa shuts the door in her face and ignores her. Chitose begs for her to open the door because she came to get her due to their grand-aunt getting worried. Tsukasa works out that Chitose must have forced their grand-aunt to give up her location and went off without permission. She finishes off by telling her to go home and tell their grand-aunt that she is now married. Chitose is completely taken aback by this but, Tsukasa ignores her outbursts and tells her to leave. Later, Tsukasa steps out after hearing that Nasa is back and sees him with Chitose. Seeing the two of them casually talking to each other and how Tsukasa called Nasa \"\"dear\", \"Chitose gets very angry and realizes that Nasa is Tsukasa's husband. Tsukasa tells Nasa who Chitose Kaginoji is; a girl who was taken in by her family. Nasa casually introduces himself to her and starts a conversation despite Chitose's protests. She states that she will not accept him as Tsukasa's partner in marriage. Surprisingly he shows good communication skills by saying she's not wrong for thinking that, due to how sudden it all was. He suggests that they go and have a nice chat about it but, Tsukasa tells him that Chitose will never accept that. Proving her right, Chitose calls a limo and proceeds to kidnap Nasa. Tsukasa manages to get to Chitose's mansion and finds Nasa in one of her rooms with an indecent looking picture of him and one of Chitose's maids. She takes it, remarking about how \"\"nice\" \"it looks, much to Nasa's shock. Chitose tells her to get a divorce because of how terrible Nasa is. She seems to agree to this telling him to follow her so they can talk it over. Once they leave the room Tsukasa reveals that she was just pretending so they could escape and that she knew the picture was edited. She also says that if she really was mad with him things would be much worse. Once they hear Chitose calling after them they make their getaway. They soon find themselves in an old church on top of a hill, with Tsukasa saying that it was prepared as an escape route. She also tells Nasa that she wanted to show it to him because it's a really wonderful place. Nasa then starts to tell her that; if something good happens to him she'll be the first to know, if something bad happens to her he'll carry the burden with her, they'll share everything, support each other and that he doesn't want her to ever regret choosing him as her husband. Nasa says how that is the kind of couple he wants them to be. Tsukasa notes how that all sounded like a proposal, to which he answers that it was before kissing her and swearing to give his eternal love. Days pass peacefully with Nasa and Tsukasa enjoying their married life together and finally getting a pair of rings for themselves. One day while they were talking about buying a new place to stay and how they'll need a guarantor, Nasa suddenly remembers that he hasn't told his parents about their marriage. After he calls to inform them of this, Tsukasa decides that she would like to meet Nasa's parents but he is unsure about introducing her to them due to how weird they can be. However, Nasa's mum texts him saying that if they don't come to visit she won't be their guarantor. Faced with this Nasa relents and the two of them decide to go to Nara to visit his parents. They also decide to get a camera for the journey and their everyday lives to make their own secret wedding diary. The two of them take a late-night bus to Nara. They stop at a service area so they use their time there to get something to eat. While Tsukasa waits for Nasa to come back from using the restroom, Chitose appears asking her what she is doing acting like a normal girl. Tsukasa tells her she is making too much of this ever since the day they first met when she was sixteen; a normal girl. Before Chitose can argue her point and just as Nasa arrives back, an idol appears in the food court area causing Tsukasa to panic about getting caught up in a tricky situation. They decide to leave with Chitose shouting after them, asking Tsukasa why she's even getting married. Back on the bus, Nasa wonders about what Chitose said but, Tsukasa reassures him saying that it's only natural some people would oppose their marriage and she wonders if his parents would be the same. He tells her that he's sure he can convince them. They arrive in Kyoto with Nasa excited about the potential of doing some sightseeing there after visiting his parents in Nara. But Tsukasa's suggestions of going to a bakery or the manga museum deflate his enthusiasm and he asks if she's not interested in seeing the historical landmarks. After seeing Nasa's disappointment, she agrees to see them. After Tsukasa gets changed into a kimono, Chitose appears again still intent on ruining their marriage. Nasa suggests that he and she have a talk together about the marriage. She agrees to this with her two maids taking Tsukasa with them. While eating at a caf\u00e9 Charlotte asks Tsukasa what she likes about Nasa. She replies by saying that he's just cute and how after hearing him talk about himself and other people, she realized how kind of a person he is. Tsukasa later meets back up with Nasa who had finished talking with Chitose. She asks if he had got her to accept or not but, he says he doesn't know and that she had gone back to Tokyo. The two of them then head off to see Nasa's parents in Nara. They finally get to the home of Nasa's parents with both of them very nervous at finally meeting them. Nasa's mother Kanoka starts to open the door but is too flustered to see her son's wife at last and quickly goes back inside. Nasa manages to convince her to meet Tsukasa and asks where his dad is to which Kanoka replies that he's in the living area and hasn't moved since the morning. They all go inside with Tsukasa being introduced to Nasa's father Enishi. After some awkward silence, Enishi asks Nasa if he'd like to go take a bath but, Nasa is wary about leaving Tsukasa alone with his parents so soon. She tells him it's fine if they want to talk to her, so he leaves still sounding a bit unsure. After Nasa leaves the room, Enishi suddenly prostrates himself before Tsukasa thanking her saving Nasa's life. He continues by saying how proud he and Kanoka are for raising such a good son despite their own faults and if he decided to marry the person who saved his life, they have nothing else to give besides happy tidings and best of luck. Enishi finishes off by asking that she take care of Nasa from now on. Tsukasa thanks him for his gracious words and asks that they also take care of her from now on. Afterwards, Tsukasa and Nasa talk about how the room they're currently in used to be his and that even though their place in Tokyo doesn't have much either, he keeps everything important in a safety deposit box, the cloud on the computer and on his person so that they have nothing to worry about. As they get ready for bed, Kanoka tells Nasa that they put in an extra futon for Tsukasa and warns him not to get \"\"too carried away\", \"since they will be sleeping in the next room over. As they go to sleep Nasa asks Tsukasa if she'd like an arm pillow. She obliges him but, this doesn't last long as his arm starts to go numb. Nasa then asks her for a good night kiss instead, which Tsukasa agrees to albeit very embarrassingly. The next morning, after waking up and going outside Tsukasa is met by Enishi who has trouble working out what to talk about with just the two of them. Tsukasa then mentions about him being an archaeologist, which Nasa had told her before. Upon hearing this Enishi excitedly takes her to his study. There she surprises him by being able to read a book that supposedly, he had never been able to understand before. Nasa soon arrives in the study and is surprised to see Tsukasa there due to her apparent dislike of historical things. She quickly denies this due to not wanting to disappoint Enishi. Nasa then notices a Japanese sword on display and asks his dad if he can pull it out for them. This shocks Enishi who has never actually pulled it out himself before but, due to wanting their respect agrees to do so. Outside, however, Enishi is still unable to take the sword out of its sheath, so Tsukasa decides to take it herself and unsheaths the blade with practised ease, much too Enishi's surprise. Later Nasa and Tsukasa finally get down to doing some sightseeing, with Tsukasa deciding that visiting historical sites with Nasa will make them more interesting. They visit the Nara Buddha and the Houryuuji, taking pictures at each one. After visiting the site of where the ruins of Heijoukyo once stood, Tsukasa starts talking about how 1300 years ago so many people actually lived there going about their daily lives. She quickly brushes this aside and they decide to film a funny video instead. Later they bid farewell to Nasa's parents as they headed back to Tokyo. However, upon arriving back at their apartment they found that it had completely burnt down. Kaname's mum has come back from her spiritual trip overseas. Apparently, she went through an unstable period because her husband eloped with a younger girl and so, she abandoned left alone her two daughters for a long period. She has gifted two tickets for a hot spring to her daughters but Aya must study for her exams and Kaname can't leave the bathhouse. She and Nasa now has a pair of tickets for their first (real) honeymoon. Moreover, they will be all alone without any intrusion from Chitose who obtained the news about their honeymoon from her maids but decided to leave them alone in any case. Conclusion? The honeymoon of the two newlyweds can now begin. And so, Tsukasa and Nasa are doing their (second) honeymoon in a hot spring town and while the hubby is super calm, the little wifey is freaking out in her mind. They are all alone and the thought that something between them could happen is stressing her. Anyway, they decide to split up and go to the public bath for an hour and then to the hot spring town together and much too Tsukasa's surprise, he comes back with an old lady: Tokiko Tsukuyomi, Tsukasa's grandaunt. Apparently, she is there just to mess around and make acquaintances with Nasa. Tokiko was wondering what kind guy her \"little ice queen\" ended up falling in love with. And so, after a quite relaxed conversation, she leaves them alone with a nice pearl for Nasa: The next day, after the combo Tsukasa-yukata nearly causes Nasa a heart attack while peacefully sightseeing with some playful banter until a more serious argument comes up: \"What's your relation with Tokiko-san?\" Nasa asked. Tsukasa and Tokiko aren't related by blood even though she is very attached to Tsukasa. But, after all, Tsukasa thinks that Tokiko is happy. Because, as she says, she found a wonderful husband. The serious stuff aside, the walk through the hot spring town continues until evening comes and something unexpected happens. It's night, dinner is over and a warm bath waits for them. Meanwhile, Tsukasa is calm and gazes at the moon from their room. Nah, she is panicking inside. The silence in the room keeps spacing and they are pretty much at their limit. He takes the lead: \"let's get in the bath together\", he murmurs with a whisper. The hush, disappeared for just a second, keeps diffusing again until Tsukasa timidly starts speaking. Quotes.

Tsukasa:Well, i was here before it was called that.\"--Tokiko talking to tsukasa in the past.&lt;br&gt; [186]-\"Someone wanted to change the world...and that...is the broken remnant of their soul."}

She is usually seen in an Otogi uniform and wears oval-shaped glasses. Personality. Usa is a student at Otogi all-girls high school. She is known to be quite an extroverted and energetic person, almost too much for her own good. Plot. Programming. Nasa comes to teach a programming class at Otogi All-Girls High School, which Usa is a part of. While Nasa is talking to Hotaru about romantic problems, Usa slams his back suddenly and asks for his first name to get his contact info. Nasa tells her his name and the backstory behind it, which Usa finds impressive. Usa then tells him about how another girl, Kaguya, has a crazy name. Love Advice for the Newlywed. Usa thinks Tsukasa feels lonely and gets jitters while Nasa is at school with her. Nasa says that his wife never gets envious, which Usa then replies by saying the calm ones are the most jealous since you can\u2019t usually tell what they are thinking. She uses Kaguya as an example before realizing that she went home. Visiting Sensei. Usa and her classmates decide to visit Nasa\u2019s home for supplementary lessons, which to their surprise, is a bathhouse. Despite that, they still go there and decide to go to the bath area first before going to the sauna. The girls decide to hold a contest to see who could last the longest there, with the winner getting juice. Usa ends up winning with surprising heat tolerance, and the girls ended up not studying at all. Horror on a Budget. Usa's film research club decides to make a limited-budget horror movie, and Usa is the cameraman. While filming, Shirogane goes missing, and Usa mentions that she was going to do preliminary inspections but isn't back yet. With no way to contact her, they continue filming while someone else goes to look for her. In the end, Usa happened to be a bystander in the filming process and barely made any appearances. Quotes. [123] \"The more cool and collected they are, the more you actually have no idea what they're thinking about.\" \"Usa when giving Nasa love advice\" Usa has a very high heat tolerance, as seen in Chapter 123."}

Young. he approximately had the same height as Nasa. He has a major injury on his right arm, he was pretty unkempt. Old. He is not shown much in his older days, but he is shown to be slim and has a few wrinkles. He wore a Yukata. He has the same hair style he had when he was young, but it is a bit shorter and kempt. Plot. Introduction. Aozora was born at a very unfortunate time. The World has just seen the end of World War I, and up until the time he was born was marked by a Booming economy fueled by war spending, but he was never able to see such a world with his own eyes as the post-war economic collapse had just fell on the country, when he was only a year old. The Great Kanto Earthquake hit when he was only four years old and the Taisho Era ended when he was only 10, with it came the dawn of the Showa Era and the Great Depression. In 1939, att a young age of 20, Aozora was conscripted to fight in WWII as a pilot, and for the next 6 years he fought and killed countless people. According to him, he may have a talent for war. Even though the death rate among pilots was over 80%, he somehow managed to survive with only a major arm injury. But for him survival was simply a word. After the war, Aozora had no place to return to; no home, no family nor friends, everyone and everything he ever knew had gone up in flames. He saw no future in himself nor could he shoulder of the sins he had committed. Soon, he wanted to kill himself.&lt;br&gt; Meeting Tsukasa. At the age of 26, he ventured into the mountains looking for a place to hang himself. He found himself a place and was about to do the deed. That was when a mysterious voice behind him told him to not do it here. It was Tsukasa. At this point of time, She had just taken in Tokiko, she asked Aozora to not kill himself in a place like this, because it may traumatize Young Tokiko. He took Tsukasa's word and started walking away looking for another place. Tsukasa stopped him again saying that she wasn't so heartless to tell someone off to look for some other place to die, stating that she is not some demon, and that it must be some kind of fate that they met and so because of that she will at the least, hear out everything he has to say... Aozora started talking to her. He told her how he has killed countless enemies and that he may have some talent for it, a talent for war. He also stated how the new world has no need for such a talent, and therefore, he had no purpose to live. Tsukasa said that there is nothing either of them could do about it. But, before they parted ways again, Tsukasa asked Aozora that he work with her in her fields, as she had to feed the growing girl. Aozora thought she was shameless to ask such a request, but for some reason he agreed thinking it was some fate at work. Working With Tsukasa. Aozora regretted working with her instantly, the ground was so rocky that he could not dig into it and the roots were imbedded so deep in the soil that he could not plough it.  His Age has been determined by the following facts: He was born in 1919. He died when Nasa was 4. The events of the Manga is said to have taken place in 2018. Therefore, Yuzaki Nasa was born in 2000, and so he was 4 in 2004. Therefore, Aozora passed away in 2004, that makes him 85 at the time. Him meeting Tsukasa was definitely a work of fate, because if she didn't save him, Nasa wouldn't be alive."}

There's a spare room in the rear of the building, and there's actually a coin laundromat between the roads. Also on the side, Nasa-kun created a program for this laundromat, so everything from the arrival of the customer to the electrical system can be managed through a smartphone.

She has purple eyes. Personality. She is Kaname's older sister. In contrast to Kaname, Aya is a lazy ditz, but Kaname considers her on the \"genius side\" for her great learning capacity. In contrast with that, she usually misunderstands important things and she gets really confused in the blink of an eye. Her favourite hobby is probably playing video games and she usually nags Kaname into playing with her. She had a crush on Nasa. History. Aya first learned about him during math class when she was 10. There was this problem nobody could solve and he just solved it without lifting a finger, she falls in love with him. Story. First encounter with Tsukasa. While Tsukasa was taking a bath at the Arisugawa Bathhouse, Aya, who was late because she had overslept, entered. She quickly realizes Tsukasa was a little shy and so, she suddenly apologizes in a very clumsy way. However, for every apology she does, she also makes Tsukasa feel uncomfortable without realizing it. So, as her last way of apologizing she decides to wipe her back, making Tsukasa feeling even more uncomfortable (she doesn't like people touching her). Once she starts, she immediately notices Tsukasa's beautiful skin. After apologizing again for comparing her to a tool, they make acquaintances and it is revealed that Tsukasa is Nasa's relative... And Aya misunderstands this to mean she is Nasa's little sister. Realizing that Tsukasa is Nasa's wife. During a normal day in which Aya was peacefully misunderstanding, like always, the fact that Tsukasa and Nasa are married, she casually discovers that Nasa-Kun and Tsukasa-chan have the same last name. Nasa and Tsukasa have just returned from Nara where they met Nasa's parents, and the fact comes up on its own during a conversation. But, our ditz's process of gaining a conclusion hasn't changed an inch and her thoughts took a wrong path again. Aya's mum pops up and with a simple statement: \"So that's your wife, Nasa-kun?\" she destroys her daughter's heart in a blink of an eye. Aya's brain can't stand this giant information and she starts screaming. To make things worse, after her mum realized Aya didn't know it, she coughs up the fact Aya liked Nasa in the presence of everyone. She has never had the courage to confess her feelings to Nasa. However, she decides to not sulk over this situation to not make her first love meaningless. And with courage and pride she congrats with them for their marriage. Takoyaki Party. Nasa organizes a takoyaki party (Takopa), and obviously, a party needs people to join it. Since the Arisugawa family is taking care of Nasa and Tsukasa, they ask them to join the party. Aya was extremely happy. Apparently, she can't accept Tsukasa yet and she thinks she is the one more suited to be Nasa's wife. Basically, she joins the party to test Tsukasa. Once the party starts, Tsukasa, who was super hyped up about cooking, makes a lot of tasty food. Aya's hostility and conviction to test Tsukasa start to crumble. Without any shelter left she desperately challenges her to a video game battle. Aya challenged wifey in a final battle at the Takopa with a videogame: Street Fighter V for PS4.

Anyway, she fixes the futon, changes the ice pack, peels some fruits..., and... nothing else to do! But, our careful wifey is too tender to stop her care and so, what to do? Well, Nasa is now feeling better and wants to change his clothes. Yeah, but he sweated a lot and it is probably better if he wipes his body before and guess what? Tsukasa asks\/imposes to do it for him and even though Nasa and his shyness were contrary to it, in the end, they surrendered. Though, the \"bottom part\" is a no-no. Indeed, as Nasa makes Tsukasa notice, on the other part even she would be ultra embarrassed. But, there is a freaking \"but\": Nasa Yuzaki Tsukasa Tsukuyomi"}

Tsukasa, taken aback by the sudden hug, notices that Nasa gained a bit of weight, so she asks him about it. While denying it at first, Nasa eventually tells the truth. Tsukasa notes that it may be her fault that he gained weight, but says she made too much because Nasa looked cute eating. She also says that no matter how heavy he gets, she will still think Nasa is cute. This hurts Nasa\u2019s heart, but he quickly gets back up and declares that he will start exercising so he can lose weight. Later, Tsukasa mentions to Kaname that Nasa is gonna run 10km every day and asks if he could handle it. Kaname says that Nasa should be relatively fit, considering that he had to work hard in PE to get all 5s on his report card. Nasa then says he\u2019ll be fine, but ultimately ends up exhausted after only a kilometer while thinking that he shouldn\u2019t have declined that much in strength.

But she starts weeping so hard Tsukasa decides to open the door. The reason Chitose came looking for Tsukasa is that their Grandaunt Tokiko is worried. Indeed, Tokiko knew Tsukasa's location and Chitose forced her to give up Tsukasa's position and meet her without Tokiko's permission. Obviously, all of that was for sake of her nee-sama (Tsukasa).

Summary. After discussing with his teacher about his future, the self-proclaimed \"man who'll attain the speed of light faster than NASA\" heads back home. Oh, you will probably get the joke if you know his name is Nasa. With a lot of thoughts spinning around in his head on a snowy day, he encounters his fate. Stone-dead?

A terrible blow hits him and everything turns to black until he opens his eyes and sees the girl in front of him covered in blood just like him. It turns out she was the one who took most of the blow, protecting him. She tells the truck driver to take Nasa to a hospital, ignoring her own injuries. Nasa tries to reach out to her but, she tells him to \"just forget about me\" and vanishes into the night. He thought to himself that it looked like she was Kaguya-Hime going back to the moon as she said that, before passing out. Nasa quickly wakes up and asks the driver where the girl went but, he tells him that he shouldn't be moving due to his injuries. But, this is not the day he can waste time, he must find her. He runs off to find the mystery girl in the snowy blizzard despite his worsening condition. He eventually finds her in a bus stop. The girl is taken aback by his actions and simply tells him to sit down. Nasa starts getting very embarrassed from being so close to her and even more so when she gives him her coat. Seeing his condition take a turn, she decides to go get someone to help him just as his injuries start to get worse. But he cannot miss this opportunity and he tells her how he thought she was Kaguya-Hime and recounts how in her story the emperor and old man should've tried harder to stop her from going back to the moon.

After a moment of silence, she turns around and tells him that if he marries her she'll go out with him. He doesn't hesitate for a second to shout out a strong yes before fainting.

Two years have passed after Nasa's encounter with the mysterious girl when she suddenly arrives at his place much to his complete and utter shock. She finally introduces herself to him as Tsukasa. After the two of them settle down at the table, Tsukasa takes out a marriage form, completely shocking Nasa. She reminds him about the day they met and how he had agreed to marry her. After reaffirming his determination and feelings for her, Nasa fills out the relevant parts of the form, clearing away any doubt and confusion he still felt as his common sense couldn't overcome her cute smile.

He then realizes that she never said anything funny about his name. She tells him that his name is a truly beautiful one. This causes him to think about how unreal this marriage is, but that his desire to marry her is most definitely real. They soon get their marriage finalized and also get a commemorative plant. Tsukasa suggests that they try holding hands now that they are married and Nasa gets so flustered about holding her hand that he starts to yearn for other things he can now touch and not just hands, which Tsukasa ends up hearing.

Nasa and Tsukasa have brought out everything that was in the storage space to their room. That building used to be where Kaname's dad did all his nerd stuff is and there are all kinds of things they can use now and even though they have all the basic things to live from now on, their room seems really old-fashioned. Kaname got a muskmelon from a customer and wondering if the two wanted it, she brought it to Nasa and Tsukasa. Once ascertained that it looks good, she quickly leaves as she would hate to get in their way. But, not before telling them, she doesn't think the sound carries all the way to the house. Without Kaname, it's just the two of them and Nasa seems eager to try all kinds of embarrassing things he wants. The next morning, Nasa receives a call from his former landlord, asking him if he was interested in moving into a new place he's having built. But Nasa hadn't come to a decision yet even though he thinks that they can't keep staying in debt to the Arisugawa family for much longer. However, Kaname is trying to convince Nasa and Tsukasa not to leave, although she realizes that \"living here probably makes it hard to get it on\". On the other hand, she very quickly changes her mind: \"but maybe the thought of me watching would add a little extra spice to it\". They are building a new apartment on top of the lot where the last one burned down, and Nasa's landlord offered to let them move in without any security deposit or initial fee, along with keeping the same rent he had before. With such a good offer, they can't deny at least a visit to another apartment that is identical to what their next apartment will be. Once there, they find a huge luxury skyscraper. Tsukasa taken by enthusiasm suggests acting like a celeb couple. Yes, she was feeling pretty good. The apartment was beautiful and the view from above even more so. A bathtub, where you can see the outside when you take a bath, quickly takes their attention, as Tsukasa would like a normal one in their new apartment and in Nasa's mind, a lustful thought about them taking a bath together is twisting around. After the bathroom, comes the bedroom that has a huge double size bed and with it, comes a question from Nasa: \"So if we move to a new place... wanna sleep on one bed?\" Nasa asked nervously and with a red face. Even more shyly, Tsukasa says yes. This sounds like an improvement. After they checked out the apartment the landlord called saying it was not their apartment and there was a mistake. Kaname Arisugawa starts early in the morning; she wakes up every day at 5:30 to get the bathhouse ready and says balancing it with high school is very tough. But now there is someone new: Tsukasa and she is more than happy to help her. Even though Kaname refuses her help, Tsukasa insists, as it really pains her to leave her debt to Kaname unpaid. And unlike Nasa-kun, she really never had the chance to get along with Kaname's family. Kaname, who can't defy Tsukasa's smile, gives up and accept her offer. It goes without saying, that with the help of Tsukasa, the cleaning ends earlier and Kaname takes advantage of this to thank Tsukasa not only for that, but deeply from her heart for saving Nasa, as she has never had the chance to say it to her.

When Chitose comes back to Nasa's apartment she soon finds out that there is nothing left (it burned down). However, her maid Aurora, asks around the neighborhood and quickly finds out that Nasa and Tsukasa are still safe, as it happened while they were in Nara. And just when Chitose was pointing out the fact that Tsukasa always disappears all the time for no reason, she quietly pops out walking in the street, wowing Chitose. Even though Chitose is relieved to find out she was unharmed, she still has a solid question twisting through her mind: Now that her house is gone, where is Tsukasa living? Tsukasa, who had gone to the supermarket and was going back to the Arisugawa Bathhouse, tries to elude her questions, but Chitose's unceasing questions force her to say where she lives. Tsukasa easily teases Chitose, convincing her that she has electricity and gas in it. Once distracted, she gains time to disappear again and goes home. But this time Chitose reacts in time and follows her to the Arisugawa Bathhouse. As soon as she enters, she finds Tsukasa, Nasa and Kaname who were discussing the idea of a Takoyaki party, apparently, the favorite pastime of cool young people. Kaname tirelessly starts asking questions about why and how she lives there. Tsukasa sleeps every night on the reception floor of the Arisugawa bathhouse with milk bottles as a pillow. Though, the prank doesn't last long as Nasa feels bad for Chitose, as she is way too na\u00efve. In the end, out of desperation, she finds out where she lives. Since Chitose's maids have never been in a bathhouse before and our guileless, and now nervous, Chitose seems quite stressed out, Kaname proposes they take a relaxing bath to cool their heads, as she wants to talk with Tsukasa afterwards. And after a nice, calm and refreshing bath, she greets everyone and leaves. She quickly realizes that they have tricked her once again, or more correctly she has done it all by herself. Obviously, she doesn't leave and justly asked Chitose. Well, unfortunately, she can't. Since they are all there, why don't they all attend the tako party, as Kaname suggests to them, also, Tsukasa hasn't talked with Aya much, and this would be a nice chance to get to know her better. On the other hand, Aya is extremely happy and joins the party to test if Tsukasa is good enough to be Nasa's wife. But, she is not the only one who thinks someone is not good enough yet. Indeed, Chitose still can't accept Nasa's marriage. And so, with these good intentions, in the evening, the tako party finally begins and much to Aya's surprise, with the help of Aurora and Charlotte, Tsukasa got a little carried away and made a lot of food for the party. But food is supposed to taste good, not just look good, and indeed it is, and Aya can't help but compliment Tsukasa. However, she didn't come for that. She came there to see if Tsukasa is a good wife or not, but it all tastes super good and now, her conviction is starting to crumble. It's not like Aya picked something she's good at just to be better than Tsukasa. Street Fighter V is a fundamental pillar of a solid marriage and even though the takoyaki party hasn't had a single takoyaki yet, a videogame tournament begins. Though, the absence of an award highlights the need for one; Nasa and he will also perform any task asked by the winner. As she gets destroyed by Aya.

It is that time of the anime where a cute girl attends the ill protagonist on a futon while gazing upon him lovingly at his side without moving for hours. Nasa tends to be one of those people who never know when to step on the brakes while at work and indeed, he is working relentlessly as always, so hard that he couldn't even notice being unwell. Luckily, there is his cute considerate wife who promptly notices his red face, and once she takes his temperature (a worrisome 39.8\u00b0C), she and our dumb workaholic protagonist become concerned. And so, despite Nasa's objections, his cute newlywed wife sees reason and is going to look after hubby until he gets better. Indeed, according to Tsukasa, Nasa doesn't have to worry about her, as she doesn't get hurt or sick. And so, she fixes the futon, changes the ice pack, peels some fruits. She is too tender to stop her care and Nasa is now feeling better and wants to change his clothes. He sweated a lot and it is probably better if he wipes his body before. Tsukasa asks to do it for him and even though Nasa and his shyness were contrary to it, in the end, they surrendered. Though, the \"bottom part\" is a no-no. Indeed, as Nasa makes Tsukasa notice, on the other hand even she would be ultra embarrassed. But, there is a freaking \"but\", as yeah...she would be embarrassed, but she wouldn't mind if it was Nasa. Though, the discussion, being too much for both of them to bear ends abruptly. Nasa's cold has gotten a lot better even though he still has a bit of a fever. He rarely gets sick and this sudden fever surprised even him. Yeah...but, as Tsukasa makes him notice, it is a must say that he never gets sick or injured because he just doesn't realize it. When he chased Tsukasa while being heavily injured in the middle of a snowstorm is a good one. However, there is Tsukasa now and her concerns towards his health make him reconsider his \"brakes\" when working too much. Anyway, it's time to catch some z's for our favorite couple, as it is quite late. Though, Tsukasa can't sleep as she is really worried about Nasa's health and can't not hug Nasa in his futon. And with that, a confession, to lift Tsukasa's mood, comes up from Nasa. He wanted to go with her to the summer festival. As Kaname suggests, if Tsukasa is going to the summer festival, she should probably wear a yukata, as is customary for couples and also, the ailing hubby is gonna feel tons better if she wears it. The summer festival is that evening and Tsukasa is gonna change into her Yukata right now. Yeah, but in the same room, there is also a desirous hubby and guess what, he must look the other way while she is changing. But something is buzzing in Nasa's mind: is he really not allowed to watch? Indeed, after all, he is her husband. And once she realizes the odds of him taking a peek even if she says no were quite high, she permits it even though only for a bit! Though, that \"bit\" quickly becomes radiography of Tsukasa's body and he can't resist saying how pretty she is with the yukata. The festival is quite lively and there are a lot of night stalls open and from all, Tsukasa wants to stop at the Takoyaki one. They recently threw a Takoyaki party, but she prefers the ones that are not fried at all and a stall sells them. And now Tsukasa is wondering if the same husband who wanted to see her change would also want her to feed him. However, shyness causes him to deny the offer. They really enjoy the peaceful evening. All the emotions gathered up during the night, with the fireworks blooming in the sky, making Nasa think deeply about how much he loves his current life and wife.

Nasa is waiting alone at his apartment for Tsukasa to come back, wrapping his head around the fact that they are now married and he quickly realizes there is a possibility they will be sleeping on the same bed and that makes him panic. In the desperation of the moment, he tries to work out a way where the two of them can sleep comfortably on one bed. But Tsukasa soon returns and much to Nasa's surprise and embarrassment she finds him hugging a pillow while imagining himself with Tsukasa. Leaving aside the moment of embarrassment, asks what she had to do and she tells him that she went to get her luggage from a coin locker. Nasa then wonders if her family would be worried about her being out so late but, his mysterious wifey says that she doesn't have a home now. Upon hearing this he decides that having one futon is fine and he can sleep on the floor but, Tsukasa suggests that she stay at a hotel for the night. Nasa seems displeased with the idea until she tells him that since she is his wife she won't be going anywhere, causing him to be completely taken aback by her words. He then wonders why she became his wife in the first place and asks her why she married him. But, she says that it's a secret, much to his annoyance. It's late-night aka time to sleep. Tsukasa suggests that she can stay at a hotel for the night, but Nasa seems displeased with the idea until she tells him that since she is his wife she won't be going anywhere, causing him to be completely taken aback by her words. When one thinks about marriage, one suddenly thinks of problems but this is not true, as there are no problems in a marriage. Let's talk instead about their first problem in their couple's life after an hour that they are married, that is not sarcasm, but the fact there is only one futon. Yeah, they could sleep in the same one, but it would probably kill both from an overdose of embarrassment. He tells her that they can buy a second futon, so she doesn't have to go. She agrees to this as long as they can try out a memory foam one. They visit a store to buy one with Tsukasa asking if this will be Nasa's first present to her, to which he answers yes. Once they come back home, a sudden existential question crosses Nasa's mind: What does marriage mean? For Nasa, right now, it means that on the other side of a thin door a girl is changing into her pajamas. Maybe this is not a definition, but Nasa is quite overwrought with a girl roaming in his apartment. Anyway, It's time to catch some z\u2019s and so, they finally both start to settle down for sleep. Unfortunately, he is unable to get any proper sleep due to being completely distracted by her. After watching her toss and turn while sleeping Nasa wonders if he should give her a goodnight kiss but, decides against it as our romantic protagonist wants their first kiss to be different. Tsukasa then suddenly gets up for a drink and upon returning to her futon, falls asleep atop his bed pulling the covers off as she slides back down to ground level. Long story short, Nasa can't sleep at all with his wifey so close. The next morning, Nasa who wakes up first can't unsee his sleepy wifey undressing in front of him. He notices that without realizing it, things have changed quite a lot from the day before and now; there is a certain person in the same room. Just when she starts taking off her pajama shirt and Nasa begins to eyeball too much skin and \"--censored--\" with bloody eyes, Kenjiro Hata comes to his senses and Nasa stops her.

In an anime, there will undoubtedly be an episode where the heroines suddenly decide to go to a hot spring or a bath for no good reason. Whenever this happens, whether they be in space or some parallel world, they will always end up in a Japanese rock style bath, and something will always happen during their baths. Is this the case? Will Nasa (and y'all perverts) see way too much Tsukasa skin? Summary. It is early morning and after getting up and changed, Tsukasa decides to get them breakfast and when she takes a look inside Nasa's fridge, she became quite surprised at the amount of food he has all labelled and well organized. He tells her that he studied dietetics and worked out the \"best\" meal for him was hot pot every day aka the same taste every day. Unimpressed by this Tsukasa tells him to wait while she prepares better food. After ten minutes they sit down to eat, with Nasa totally surprised by the amazing results she produced. Once they finish their meal they decide to go to the nearest bathhouse, as Nasa's apartment doesn't have a bath and he knows the owners well, with our horny Nasa really wanting to see Tsukasa after she takes a bath. And so, they head out and after buying various things for Tsukasa they arrive at the Arisugawa Bathhouse, a queer bathhouse with two queer sisters. Let's start with Kaname Arisugawa who is already working when they arrive and is completely shocked that Nasa has brought a girl with him. Indeed, she thought he studied so much that his libido withered away, but that is not true as he yells in the middle of the road trying to defend himself from a delicate young high school girl like her. Yeah, but two rows above it says she is queer, why? Well, she likes dirty jokes and in particular, she is not a delicate young girl. Intrigued by the situation she then asks if they are dating but, Nasa instead tells her that the two of them are married, shocking her even more. After congratulating them (albeit still a bit unsure) Kaname invites Tsukasa in to take a bath. Nasa attempts to go in as well but is stopped by Kaname who demands an explanation for what is going on with this girl, as in her (queer) mind there were no possibilities for Nasa to get a girlfriend and she also dreams about him reaching 30-something years and believing he is a wizard. Kaname then asks if he's told Aya, Kaname's sister, about it but, he says that he hasn't. She tells him that she won't tell Aya and asks when the ceremony is but, Nasa says that he hadn't thought about one or getting rings. After hearing that he hasn't even proposed to Tsukasa, Kaname tells him that since he decided to marry her he has a duty to make her happy. Filled with new resolve, Nasa declares that he will make her happy because he loves his wifey, who walks out at this very moment to get her things and clearly hears what he just said, much to both of their embarrassment. She takes her things from him and tells him that even though she gets embarrassed when he says that in front of other people, she also gets really happy. Once inside the bathhouse. Something is twisting around in Nasa's mind: the possibility to see his wifey in her birthday suit. Yeah, but is there something he should do? In accordance with the definition of a bath episode, he must act normally and a naked wife will appear in front of him or at least this is so in Nasa's mind. But, for our boy, the world is harder than he thinks and a little teenager who likes peeking appears instead: Kaname Arisugawa. And without any clear reason besides messing around and having fun with him, she stays in the doorway and starts smiling and peeking. She picked on him so much that in the end, the poor guy exits the bath exhausted and without any force. Meanwhile, Tsukasa is enjoying her bath until Kaname's sister, a klutz, appears in the bath with her; she introduces herself as the eldest daughter of the bathhouse. She apologizes for watching Tsukasa while she was bathing and asks if she would like her back wiped to make up for it. After some persuasion as Tsukasa doesn't like being touched, she takes her up on the offer. The girl remarks on how beautiful Tsukasa's skin is, comparing it to silk but, then realizes silk is a cloth that comes from silkworms and no matter how pretty her skin is, comparing it to insect excrement is not the right choice. Instead, she decides to compare it to an iPhone x for reasons unknown to Tsukasa. She is a klutz. The girl then gives her name as Arisugawa Aya and Tsukasa introduces herself as Yuzaki Tsukasa, with Aya assuming she's Nasa's little sister. She is a klutz. After Nasa's bath, Tsukasa meets back up with him and is accompanied by Kaname's older sister: Aya Arisugawa. Due to the earlier misunderstanding, Aya doesn't realize that the two of them are married and neither of them is aware of this. Tsukasa is told how Nasa helped support the Arisugawa family and their business after they fell on hard times. Tsukasa appears disappointed with hearing how grateful Aya is to Nasa but, he doesn't notice this. The two of them then leave the bathhouse and head back home. Tsukasa says how cute Aya seems to be with Nasa completely agreeing with her and not realizing his poor choice of words. Just as he realizes this he sees her looking at a church wedding (complete coincidence) and remembers what Kaname told him about their marriage. He asks if she is concerned about that thing (no ceremony or rings) but, she assumes he is talking about Aya and totally gets the wrong idea. Tsukasa says that she wants him to say that she is cute too but he still misunderstands. After some back and forth he decides that he can't say it right now and goes off to check something, telling her to go back home and wait for him. Meanwhile, a new character makes her appearance: Chitose Kaginoji.

A lonely wife is all alone in her house the day after she got married. Has she been dumped? Nope, but she has to wait for her beloved one until he comes home as he doesn't have the keys. How can she kill time? Will there be an unwanted guest aka a new character? Well yes, otherwise why would I have chosen such a specific question to lengthen this poor preface? Summary. Tsukasa, awaiting Nasa's return, decides to clean the place but finds out much to her surprise that her capable hubby has already cleaned everything in plain sight, and she doesn't want to risk seeing what sort of \"secret\" things he might have hidden away. And so, we will never find out if Nasa is a pervert. Will this stop Tsukasa's attempt to surprise Nasa when he comes back? Nah, as there is another thing that can be done around the house: cooking. But soon the doorbell rings and Tsukasa, who assumes it's Nasa goes to answer, only to be greeted by a young girl: Chitose Kaginoji, \"Tsukasa's sister, but not her real sister\".Indeed, she refers to Tsukasa as her \"sister\" and says how the place Tsukasa is now staying is a shabby apartment complex and doesn't suit her. Reply? Before she can finish Tsukasa peacefully shuts the door in her face. But the small girl starts weeping so hard Tsukasa decides to open the door again. The reason Chitose came looking for Tsukasa is that their Grandaunt, Tokiko Tsukuyomi, is worried. Indeed, Tokiko knew Tsukasa's location and Chitose forced her to give up Tsukasa's position and meet her without Tokiko's permission. Obviously, all of that was for the sake of her nee-sama (Tsukasa). But Tsukasa can't see any reason for Tokiko's involvement and ends Chitose's attempts to bring her back by telling her she is now married. Chitose, wowed by his spirit decides to tell him what happened (without mentioning Tsukasa's name) and describes the person she has problems with: She is like a butterfly with glass wings... A glass butterfly that flies through the night, trying to reach the moon... She's easily hurt, delicate and disappears the second you let her out of your sight, but she is still someone I care a lot about \"\" ~~Chitose talking about Tsukasa. And just when she starts appreciating the fact that he was randomly listening to a depressed middle school girl... she heard a loud \"oh dear!\" from Tsukasa who popped out behind her and so, she quickly realizes Nasa is Tsukasa's husband. Tsukasa tells Nasa that the girl is Chitose Kaginoji; a girl who was taken in by her family. Nasa casually introduces himself to her and starts a conversation despite Chitose's protests. She states that she will not accept him as Tsukasa's partner in marriage. Surprisingly he shows his good communication skills by saying she's not wrong for thinking that, due to how sudden it all was. But Chitose won't simply accept that and she does the most obvious thing to do in these cases: she kidnaps Nasa. And so, our (now) determined girl with a snap of her fingers calls a limousine that carries away our poor Nasa to Chitose's villa. That said, even though I never said what, to begin with, she is classy and won't stoop to torture as there are other better ways to wreck his marriage. Chitose, more convinced than ever before, with the help of her maids, Aurora and Charlotte wants to get Nasa into an s#x scandal. But when she sees Charlotte (her innocent maid, but maybe not so innocent) taking her new (lewd?) errand way too seriously, her confidence crumbles and after losing time with a confusing chat regarding how her maid should be more hesitant with lewd things, she loses sight of Nasa who flees into the mansion. Hubby, who starts looking for Tsukasa's room, as he assumes she lived there, finally finds one with her smell. A new fetish is awakening in him. Inside, he notices a glass case with a moonstone and his surprise could only grow when Charlotte appears with a large sword breaking her way into the room and telling him that he isn't allowed in there. She proceeds to start attacking him but, Chitose and Aurora arrive shouting at her to not be so reckless in that room. Unfortunately, she ends up damaging the case with the moonstone in it. Nasa however quickly manages to fix it, preserving the moonstone and also works out from Chitose's reaction that the stone is definitely real. She tells him that their grand-aunt borrowed it to ease Tsukasa. Upon hearing Nasa's confusion about this she realizes that he doesn't know what Tsukasa is and asks if he knows anything about her past. He answers that he doesn't which causes Chitose to get really angry that her \"sister\" married someone who knew nothing about her. Charlotte intervenes saying that Nasa did save Tsukasa's moonstone and hugs him as thanks but, Aurora takes this chance to take a picture of them and edits it to make it look indecent. Just then Tsukasa appears taking the picture and remarking about how \"nice\" it looks, much to Nasa's shock. Chitose tells her to get a divorce because of how terrible he is. She seems to agree to this telling him to follow her so they can talk it over. Once they leave the room, it becomes clear that they fled instead. Indeed, Tsukasa reveals that she was just pretending so they could escape and if she really was mad things would be much worse for him. They soon find themselves in an old church built in the Meiji era. Seeing her so bright and happy Nasa realizes what devotion really is. He starts to tell her that; if something good happens to him she'll be the first to know, if something bad happens to her he'll carry the burden with her, they'll share everything, support each other and that he doesn't want her to ever regret choosing him as her husband. And if this sounds like a proposal, it is because it is one and what better way of sealing it than a kiss after swearing to give her his eternal love.

Engagement rings are basically things you give to girls when you are proposing, \"That's what you spend the three months of salary on\", while wedding rings are the paired rings that men and women put on their ring fingers. On the way back home, Tsukasa convinces Nasa to stop by a public park and airily sit on a bench. Nasa leaves her alone until night for work and once he realizes that, he doesn't take too long to steal a kiss from Tsukasa's lips in broad daylight. And a kiss out in the open is a good step forward for our couple even though Tsukasa can't help but call the bold hubby a perv. Let's go back to talking about the rings again. They are already married and so, the engagement rings aren't needed. Nasa really wants them \"to show their powerful love\" but, our clumsy boy doesn't know how much a diamond ring can actually cost in real life. She knows and refuses the idea to buy them. And how to destroy his will to buy them? She convinces him to go to the most expensive jewellery store. Because as long as they have a ring which shows their eternal love, they can feel each other nearby even when they are apart. Long story short, he wants to buy them for Tsukasa, as she is feeling quite lonely while he is at work, and once she realizes that, to make Nasa happy, she accepts buying them, but only the cheapest ones. As she will remember that day whenever she looks at that ring, she will remember how her hubby nearly spent a fortune for their rings, but in the end they bought the cheapest ones. But most importantly, she will remember how kind Nasa is and how much he cares about her. Tsukasa Tsukuyomi Nasa Yuzaki Chitose Kaginoji Aurora Charlotte Kaname Arisugawa"}

Tsukasa puts her hair up every evening before bed. But, as she moves a lot while sleeping, they come loose almost instantly. Also, she is a sleepwalker and always goes to drink water in the middle of the night while half-asleep and on her way back, she usually tries to grab Nasa's covers and then fall asleep in her futon. This is her usual sleepwalker routine. But not this time, as she accidentally goes into Nasa's bed instead of her futon, and so, our poor boy can't catch any z's with wifey so close. He is her husband and there is nothing wrong even if she wakes up from him grabbing her. And so, Nasa's hands, propelled by his blood pressure going up and up as it clouds his mind, land in a new world to discover: Tsukasa. Even if lost in a maze of thoughts, new discoveries are not long coming for him, as he suddenly realizes how warm his wife is and how good she smells. But the greedy explorer doesn't stop there and becomes an archaeologist, as his hand guided by an ecstatic mind digs approaches a hill. The situation is too much to bear for Nasa and ends when Tsukasa, turning around, starts staring at Nasa who, panicking inside, doesn't understand if she is awake or not. She kisses him and rolls back on her futon. He didn't sleep a wink after that. In the morning, Nasa thrilled by the previous events, is daydreaming of sleeping in the same bed with Tsukasa. Indeed, he is willing to buy a new larger apartment. It'll be tight to sleep if they both stay in the same room for too long and sleeping is a pain because they sleep on different beds and Tsukasa is a sleepwalker. Furthermore, Kaname put in his head a new thought to deal with: \"do you two not hold hands before sleeping?\" aka Nasa's new mission. Even though Tsukasa was okay with the actual apartment, a good reason to relocate shows up on its own; Nasa's apartment is too small for the two of them: There is actually a big \"but\" before they buy a new home: they need a guarantor. It could easily be Nasa's parents and Nasa never told them about their marriage. Therefore, a phone call is needed and even though the first reply were sounds he has never heard before, his mum calms down once she hears his wife is the \"super-cute girl\" who saved his life. After the call, Tsukasa decides that she would like to meet Nasa's parents but he is unsure about introducing her to them due to how weird it could be. However, Nasa's mom texts him saying that if they don't come to visit she won't be their guarantor. Faced with this, Nasa relents and the two of them decide to go to Nara to visit his parents. Indeed, Nasa's parents aren't from Tokyo but from Nara and news of their future travel to Nara quickly reaches Chitose through her spies maids. Tsukasa also decides to get a camera for the journey and their everyday lives to make their own secret wedding diary and even though the purchase was meant for her, Nasa's lust awakens and hubby can't stop taking photos of his wife. She confiscates the camera. They haven't had a honeymoon yet and so, this seems like the perfect occasion. They will feed two birds with one scone: meet Nasa's parents and enjoy some time together. They decide to take a late-night bus to Kyoto because it was way cheaper than the train. Meanwhile, Chitose and her two maids are chasing them. Indeed, Chitose hasn't accepted their marriage yet and is hoping it ends. Nasa Yuzaki Tsukasa Tsukuyomi Kaname Arisugawa Chitose Kaginoji Charlotte Aurora"}

Once the bus stops at a late-night service area, Chitose (with her maids) is eager to find any rifts between Nasa and Tsukasa's love. Indeed, she thinks that even small problems can put an end to a male-female relationship. Also, she believes that there is no need to cause any of them. In effect, are these problems starting on their own? Yes, but as soon as a problem seems to appear for real, making Chitose all excited, it disappears in a blink of an eye. They turn every little problem into a new and unique way of flirting, making Chitose's plan more and more pointless over time. While Chitose is plotting her plan, Tsukasa and Nasa are deciding what to eat and while Nasa is willing to eat something from a chain restaurant, Tsukasa exhorts him to try something else, as he can eat that stuff back at home. Following her reasoning, Tsukasa, who was very observant, choose of her own will lime udon, as they were suggested by Hirunendesu. It tastes like someone put some lime slices on top of cold udon. Apparently, it's exactly what you would expect, to the point that it is unexpected. The only thing who could spice it up is the lime which hubby challenges her to eat. Chitose annoyed by their continuous flirting, while Nasa was absent, makes her first move and appears in front of Tsukasa who was sitting all alone. She suddenly starts a tough discussion, asking her what she is even doing there and that she is not a normal girl. But, when the discussion starts bending at Tsukasa's past, a Hirunendesu's reporter appears. Fearing that appearing on TV might alert Tokiko, the trio (Chitose, Aurora and Charlotte) runs away. Also, the bus is about to pull out and so, Nasa and Tsukasa decide to leave with Chitose shouting after them, asking Tsukasa why she's even getting married. Back on the bus, Nasa wonders about what Chitose said but, Tsukasa reassures him saying that it's only natural some people would oppose their marriage and she wonders if his parents would be the same. But, he tells her that he's sure he can convince them. The next morning, they arrive in Kyoto with Nasa excited about the potential of doing some sightseeing there after visiting his parents in Nara. But Tsukasa's suggestions of going to a bakery or the manga museum deflate his enthusiasm and he asks if she's not interested in seeing the historical landmarks. After seeing Nasa's disappointment, she agrees to see them. Exactly when couple starts flirting in front of a shop early in the morning, a super high-spirited teenager interrupts them. Chitose stubbornly wants a direct confrontation with them. As long as she doesn't accept the marriage, she will not allow their relationship. This improvised situation makes Nasa think things over. He wants to make his marriage happy for everyone and so, he invites Chitose to talk with just the two of them. But he isn't the only one who has had an idea. With the main target \"to show the world how much of a pathetic fool Nasa is\", Chitose will play Nasa's lover and depending on his performance she will see if he is a worthy man or not. Yeah, but can Nasa go to Kyoto without knowing nothing? Obviously, no. He has done a lot of research and he takes Chitose to a lot of nice places. But, she was more wowed by his organization and his kind character rather than anything else. Though his strong character makes her dubious again, mostly for the fact that he doesn't know anything about Tsukasa. This irritates her a lot. Nasa evaluates the little things he knows about his wife and he thinks that his meeting with Tsukasa was fate. But, Chitose still doesn't see this as a good reason and she thinks that fate is just something illusory and a hunch at the end of the day.

Tsukasa is worried she will not be able able to get along with Nasa's parents. But hubby doesn't believe so, as he will be the one to introduce her and he will make sure they know she is the cutest girl in the universe. Late in the evening, their taxi finally arrives at the home of Nasa's parents with both of them very nervous at meeting them. Nasa's mother, Kanoka, starts to open the door but is too flustered to see her son's wife and quickly goes back inside. Nasa manages to convince her to meet Tsukasa and asks where his dad is to which Kanoka replies that he's in the living area and hasn't moved since the morning. They all go inside with Tsukasa being introduced to Nasa's father: Enishi. After some awkward silence, Enishi asks Nasa if he'd like to go take a bath but, Nasa is very wary about leaving Tsukasa alone with his parents. She tells him it's fine if they want to talk to her, so he leaves still sounding a bit unsure. After Nasa leaves the room, Enishi suddenly prostrates himself before Tsukasa, thanking her for saving Nasa's life. He continues by saying how proud he and Kanoka are for raising such a good son despite their own faults and if he decided to marry the person who saved his life, they have nothing else to give besides happy tidings and best of luck. Enishi finishes off by asking that she take care of Nasa from now on. Tsukasa thanks him for his gracious words and asks that they also take care of her from now on. As they get ready for bed, Kanoka tells Nasa that they put in an extra futon for Tsukasa and warns him not to get \"too carried away\", since they will be sleeping in the next room over. Nasa quickly realizes what she meant and gets completely flustered by the situation presented to him. This time, they are both sleeping on a futon and there isn't any height problem between them like before. And so, his wife is now right there, with her guard down, just within his reach in a futon next to him. Though, he soon realizes how painful it is and his arm doesn't take long to become numb. On the other hand, wifey is so close to him that he can perceive her body warmth and smell. The fragile equilibrium easily breaks and Nasa then asks for a good night kiss instead, which Tsukasa agrees to albeit very embarrassingly. The next morning, after waking up and going outside, Tsukasa is met by Enishi who has trouble working out what to talk about with just the two of them. Tsukasa then mentions about him being an archaeologist, which Nasa had told her before. Upon hearing this Enishi excitedly takes her to his study. There she surprises him by being able to read a book that supposedly, he had never been able to understand before. Nasa soon arrives in the study and is surprised to see Tsukasa there due to her apparent dislike of historical things. In the afternoon, Nasa and Tsukasa finally get down to doing some sightseeing, with Tsukasa deciding that visiting historical sites with Nasa will make them more interesting. They visit the Nara Buddha and the Houryuuji, taking pictures at each one. After visiting the site where the ruins of Heijoukyo once stood, Tsukasa starts talking about how 1300 years ago so many people actually lived there going about their daily lives, but she quickly brushes this aside and they decide to film a funny video instead.

Nasa's apartment has completely burnt down and the plant commemorating their marriage is miraculously intact and Nasa is very relieved. He is already organized and his bank book and other important things are in a safety deposit box. Nasa and Tsukasa have nowhere to go and Kaname kindly offers for them to stay at the Arisugawa Bathhouse until they find a new place. And obviously, knowing Kaname, the offer can't be asked in a normal way and is asked while Nasa was taking a bath. Kaname thinks that hosting Nasa and Tsukasa at the bathhouse is a nice way to thank Nasa for everything he has done for the place. Luckily, there is a pretty big building they don't use in the bathhouse and it already has two futons and some furniture. Tsukasa thinks not. Indeed, she thinks that if people reach out right away when you are in trouble, it is a sign that you are well-liked and Nasa is well-liked by them. On the other hand, Nasa really likes how Tsukasa pays him a lot of attention. Nasa and Tsukasa living at the Arisugawa bathhouse is fine for everyone who lives there: Kaname, Aya and their mom. Aya has a crush on him, but she doesn't know yet that he is now married or better to say, she is such an airhead she still hasn't realized it. And so, during a normal evening in which Aya was peacefully misunderstanding, like always, the fact that Tsukasa and Nasa are married, she casually discovers that Nasa-Kun and Tsukasa-chan have the same last name. Nasa and Tsukasa have just returned from Nara where they met Nasa's parents, and the fact comes up on its own during a conversation. But, our ditz's process of gaining a conclusion hasn't changed an inch and her thoughts took a wrong path again. Indeed, the wrong conclusion is that he wants to stay on good terms with his parents. And just when one might think how long she will continue to misunderstand things, Aya's mom pops up and with a simple statement: \"So that's your wife, Nasa-kun?\", destroys her daughter's heart in a blink of an eye. Aya's brain can't stand this giant information and she starts screaming. To make things worse, after her mom realized Aya didn't know, she coughs up the fact that Aya liked Nasa in the presence of everyone. That was the final blow. Aya first learned about him during math class when she was 10. There was this problem nobody could solve and he just solved it like it was nothing. And so, she fell in love with him. But, she has never had the courage to confess her feelings to Nasa. However, she decides not to sulk over this situation so her first love isn't meaningless. And with courage and pride, she congratulates them for their marriage. Nasa and Tsukasa have a bunch of dirty clothes and so, Tsukasa wanna do some laundry and Nasa is willing to go alone to a coin laundry. But, Tsukasa has one problem. Is she worried about the laundry expenses? No. Does she think laundry is a chore only girls can do? No... and so, what is the problem? It will be embarrassing to let him see her underwear. They decide to both go to the coin laundry owned by the Arisugawa family and Nasa can't help noticing that Tsukasa is wearing a tracksuit. She doesn't have other clothes to wear as a lot of them burned in the fire and the ones which survived are now being washed. But that is not all, as she also hasn't got any underwear to wear aka she doesn't have anything under the tracksuit aka Nasa is quite turned on and can't stop himself from taking a photo of an embarrassed wifey. According to Kaname's suggestion: girls can stay cute for a long time because they always strive to look cute and once a husband stops helping his wife stay cute the girl will change from your cute wife into your average roommate buddy. Hubby must buy some new clothes for Tsukasa. Indeed, most of her clothes burned to a crisp in the fire. And so, it's shopping time which can be described in a nutshell as \"Tsukasa tries new clothes and Nasa says it is super cute\" until she offers for him to choose the new dresses for her and the pure maiden taste of Nasa shows up in the blink of an eye. But, there is something else she needs to buy: underwear and once in the shop, submerged by girls underwear in every direction, Nasa's firmness starts to crumble.

{"url":"https:\/\/tonikaku-kawaii.fandom.com\/wiki?curid=2420","text":"Fly Me To The Moon Chapter 4 New character. Prince Umayado, more commonly known as Prince Sh\u014dtoku, was a fairly legendary figure in Japanese history, and lived from 574 to 622 CE. While some historians believe that he was actually a collection of people, his achievements and contributions to Japanese history are all very real. He's most famously credited for the spread of Buddhism throughout Japan, and the modernization \/ centralization of the Japanese government. Speculated timeline. This chapter also mentions the \"Great Country of Sui\", referring to the Sui Dynasty, one of the shorter-lived Chinese dynasties, which lasted from 581 to 618 CE. Importantly, the Sui Dynasty featured a strong central government, and strongly promoted Buddhism throughout the empire. In 595 CE, a Buddhist priest known as Hyeja became the first priest to come to Japan from Goguryeo, and told Prince Sh\u014dtoku that Sui \"is a great country, well-regulated by a strong government and protected by Buddhism\". Hyeja would go on to become Prince Sh\u014dtoku's teacher of Buddhism, and while this was not the first exposure Prince Sh\u014dtoku had to Sui China, it was greatly influential on his actions from then forward. Given these facts, it would be fair to estimate that this chapter took place between 595 and 600 CE, after the start of Prince Sh\u014dtoku's regency, but before he began establishing his new centralized government. (Notably, \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\" wouldn't be written until a few hundred years later, during the Heian Period.) More info about Tsukasa's Age. Tsukasa became immortal at age 16, and while the time she spent wandering alone isn't clear, let's assume that it was between 1 and 5 years. In that case, she would've been around 20 years old in this chapter, thus placing her birth year around 580 CE. As such, her true age is actually around 1440 years old in 2021, which is quite close to her original statement of \"around 1400 years\". Major thanks to Tsukinara for theorizing the speculation above.
